This sets up a conditional relationship where discussing the issue implies it wasn't in depth.\n* **Conclusion:** If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed. This also sets up a conditional relationship, but reverses the direction, stating that an in-depth discussion implies no discussion at all.\n\nNow, let's consider if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.  The premise doesn't rule out the possibility that the issue was *not* discussed at all. If it wasn't discussed, then it couldn't have been discussed in depth. This means the conclusion doesn't hold up based on the premise.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
