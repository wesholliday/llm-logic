Consider these possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1:** Sam took a plane, and Erin happened to take a train (even though she didn't have to). This scenario fits both premises.\n* **Possibility 2:** Sam did not take a plane. This also fits both premises, as it doesn't trigger the condition in Premise 1.\n\nSince we have at least one scenario where the premises hold true, but Sam didn't take a plane, we cannot definitively conclude that Sam did not take a plane.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
