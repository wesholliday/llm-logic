This means there are situations where Amy might not play tennis. \n\nNow look back at Statement 1. It only makes a claim about Amy playing tennis IF Jeff played basketball.  If Jeff didn't play basketball, Statement 1 says nothing about whether Amy played tennis or not.\n\nTherefore, Amy not having to play tennis doesn't tell us anything definite about whether Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
