This means the truck could be any color, including blue. \n\nConsider these possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1: The truck is blue.**  This doesn't contradict our premises. The car could be red or some other color.\n* **Possibility 2: The truck is not blue.**  If the truck isn't blue, then Premise 1 tells us the car can't be red.\n\nSince we have a possible scenario where the truck isn't blue, and in that scenario the car can't be red, we can infer that the car might not be red.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
