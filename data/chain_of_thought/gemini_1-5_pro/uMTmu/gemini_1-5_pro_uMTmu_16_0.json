This means they could have been something else.  Importantly, this doesn't contradict Premise 1.  \n\nPremise 1 only states what happens IF the shirt was cotton. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the shirt wasn't cotton. The shirt could be a different material, and the pants could still be something other than denim.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
