Consider these possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1:** The robot visited Jupiter. This would be compatible with Statement 2 because it doesn't say the robot *couldn't* visit Jupiter, just that it wasn't a necessity.\n* **Possibility 2:** The robot did not visit Jupiter. This is also compatible with Statement 2.\n\nNow let's consider Statement 1 in light of these possibilities:\n\n* **If Possibility 1 is true (robot visited Jupiter):**  Statement 1 doesn't tell us anything definitive about the alien visiting Mars. The alien might have visited Mars, or might not have.\n* **If Possibility 2 is true (robot did NOT visit Jupiter):** Statement 1 tells us the alien could NOT have visited Mars. If the alien had visited Mars, then the robot would have had to visit Jupiter (according to Statement 1).\n\nSince we don't know for sure whether the robot visited Jupiter, we have to consider both possibilities. Only one of those possibilities (robot didn't visit Jupiter) leads to the definite conclusion that the alien didn't visit Mars.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
