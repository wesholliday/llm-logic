This means there are situations where Lucy doesn't go to the zoo. \n\nNow look back at Statement 1. It only makes a claim about Lucy IF Joe went to the park. If Joe didn't go to the park, Statement 1 says nothing about Lucy.\n\nTherefore, Lucy not having to go to the zoo doesn't tell us anything definitive about whether Joe went to the park or not.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
