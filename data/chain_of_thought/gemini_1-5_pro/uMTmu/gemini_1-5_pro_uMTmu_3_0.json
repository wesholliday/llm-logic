This means it could be a mystery novel, or it could be something else. \n\nConsider these possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1: The book IS a mystery novel.**  Premise 1 doesn't guarantee that *only* James writes mystery novels. Someone else could have. So, this possibility doesn't rule out James as the author.\n* **Possibility 2: The book IS NOT a mystery novel.** Premise 1 states that *if* James wrote it, *then* it's a mystery. Since it's not a mystery, James couldn't have written it. This possibility means James is NOT the author.\n\nSince we have at least one possibility where James didn't write the book, we can validly infer that he might not have.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
