This means there are scenarios where Bob could choose something other than pasta. \n\nNow, let's consider Premise 1. It only states what happens IF Sue chooses pizza. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Sue *doesn't* choose pizza.  Bob could still choose pasta even if Sue chooses something else.\n\nTherefore, the fact that Bob doesn't *have* to choose pasta doesn't tell us anything about Sue's choice. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
