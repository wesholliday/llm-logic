This means there are other possibilities for the muffin flavor.  \n\nImportantly, Premise 1 only links chocolate cake to blueberry muffins. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the muffins are *not* blueberry.  The cake could still be chocolate even if the muffins are something else.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
