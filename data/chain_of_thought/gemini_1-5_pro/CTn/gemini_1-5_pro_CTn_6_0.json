This is a conditional statement, where Sue choosing pizza is the condition, and Bob not choosing pasta is the result.\n\n* **Inference to test:** If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza. This is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n* **Contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by switching the hypothesis and conclusion, and negating both.  The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n* **Are they logically equivalent?** Yes, the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
