            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Original statement:** If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis. This is a conditional statement. We can represent it as:  If P, then Q (where P = Jeff played basketball, Q = Amy did not play tennis).\n\n* **Contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent.  The contrapositive is formed by switching the hypothesis and conclusion, and negating both. The contrapositive of our original statement would be: If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\n\n* **Are the original statement and its contrapositive logically equivalent?** Yes, they are.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
