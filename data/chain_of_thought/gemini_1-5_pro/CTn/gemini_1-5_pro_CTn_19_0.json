This scenario aligns with the inference we're trying to make.\n* **If TF is false (meaning Tom did NOT watch football):**  The original statement doesn't tell us anything about whether Jen watched basketball or not. She could have, or she could have not. This scenario doesn't contradict the inference.\n\nSince neither possibility contradicts the inference, we can logically make the inference.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
