So we have: If A, then not B.\n\n* **Inference we're checking:** If Mark bought the blue shirt (this is 'B'), then Lisa did not buy the red shirt (this is 'not A'). So we have: If B, then not A.\n\n* **Relationship:**  The original statement and the inference are actually the contrapositives of each other. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is formed by switching the hypothesis and conclusion, and negating both. \n\n* **Validity of Contrapositives:** Importantly, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
