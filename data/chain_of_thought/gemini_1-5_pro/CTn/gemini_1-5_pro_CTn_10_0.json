This is a classic \"If P, then Q\" statement.\n* **We're asked about:** If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside. This looks like the \"contrapositive\".\n\nThe contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".  The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nLet's apply this to our problem:\n\n* **P:** The dog was inside.\n* **Q:** The cat was not outside.\n* **Not Q:** The cat was outside.\n* **Not P:** The dog was not inside.\n\nThe question asks about \"If not Q, then not P\", which is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
