            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Original statement:** If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding. This is a conditional statement.  We can represent it symbolically as:  If M, then not S.\n\n* **Inference we're testing:** If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding. Symbolically: If S, then not M.\n\n* **Relationship:**  The original statement and the inference are the *contrapositive* of each other. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is formed by switching the hypothesis and conclusion, and negating both.\n\n* **Logical Equivalence:**  A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
