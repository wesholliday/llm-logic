This means if Alex wins, Chris automatically loses. \n\n* **Question:** Can we infer \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex did not finish the race?\" This is asking if Chris winning means Alex automatically loses.\n\n* **Reasoning:** The original statement only tells us what happens if Alex wins. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Chris wins.  It's possible they could both finish the race, just not in the top two spots.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
