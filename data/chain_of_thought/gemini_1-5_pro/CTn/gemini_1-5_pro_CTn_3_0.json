This is a conditional statement, where \"written by James\" is the hypothesis and \"not a mystery novel\" is the conclusion.\n\n* **Inference to test:** If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James. This is also a conditional statement.\n\n* **Relationship:**  The inference switches the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement and negates both. This is the structure of a contrapositive.\n\n* **Logical equivalence:** In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. If the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
