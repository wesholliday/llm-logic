            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the doll was plastic, then the truck was not metal. This is a conditional statement. We can represent it symbolically as:  If P, then not Q (where P = doll is plastic, Q = truck is metal).\n\n* **Inference we're testing:** If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic. Symbolically: If Q, then not P.\n\n* **Logical relationship:**  The original statement and the inference are the **contrapositive** of each other. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is formed by switching the hypothesis and conclusion, and negating both. \n\n* **Validity of contrapositives:**  A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
