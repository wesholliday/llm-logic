We can represent this as:  V \u2192 not M\n\n* **We want to know if we can infer:** If the mummy was awake (M), then the vampire was not awake (not V). This can be represented as: M \u2192 not V\n\n* **Consider the possibilities:**\n\n    * **If V is true (vampire awake):** The original statement forces M to be false (mummy asleep). This aligns with what we want to infer.\n\n    * **If M is true (mummy awake):** The original statement forces V to be false (vampire asleep) because if V were true, M would have to be false. This also aligns with what we want to infer.\n\n* **Logical equivalence:**  The original statement and the one we want to infer are logically equivalent. They both mean the vampire and mummy cannot be awake at the same time.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
