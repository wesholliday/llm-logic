We can represent this as: P -> not Z\n* **We're asked about:** If Lucy went to the zoo (Z), then Joe did not go to the park (not P). This can be represented as: Z -> not P\n\nNotice that the original statement and the question are about the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by switching the hypothesis and conclusion, and negating both. \n\n* **Contrapositive of the original:** If Lucy went to the zoo (Z), then Joe did not go to the park (not P). This is: Z -> not P\n\nSince the contrapositive and the original statement are logically equivalent, if the original statement is true, so is the contrapositive.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
