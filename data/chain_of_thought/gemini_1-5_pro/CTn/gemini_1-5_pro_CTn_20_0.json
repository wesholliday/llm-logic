            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow. This is a conditional statement, where \"apple was red\" is the hypothesis and \"banana was not yellow\" is the conclusion.\n\n* **Inference we're testing:** If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red. This is also a conditional statement.\n\n* **Relationship:** The inference is essentially switching the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement and negating both.  This is called the contrapositive.\n\n* **Logical equivalence:** In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.  This means if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
