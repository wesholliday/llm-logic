We can represent this as: P -> ~S \n* **Contrapositive:**  The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent. To form the contrapositive, we reverse and negate both parts of the original statement. So the contrapositive of P -> ~S is S -> ~P. This translates to: If Kate ate the salad (S), then Ben did not eat pasta (~P).\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
