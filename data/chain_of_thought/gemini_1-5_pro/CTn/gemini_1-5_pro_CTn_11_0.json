This sets up a conditional relationship where a chocolate cake means no blueberry muffins.\n\n* **Inference we're testing:** If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate. This is essentially flipping the original statement and negating both parts.\n\n* **Logical equivalence:**  In logic, flipping and negating both parts of a conditional statement is called taking the contrapositive. The important thing to remember is that the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\n**Answer:** Yes \n"
