This is a conditional statement, where visiting Mars is the hypothesis and the robot not visiting Jupiter is the conclusion.\n\n2. **We're asked about:** If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars. This is essentially flipping the hypothesis and conclusion from the original statement and negating both.\n\n3. **Logical equivalence:**  Flipping and negating a conditional statement is the same as finding its contrapositive.  The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n**Answer: Yes** \n"
