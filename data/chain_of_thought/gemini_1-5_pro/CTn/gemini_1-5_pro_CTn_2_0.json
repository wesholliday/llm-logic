This means the griffin and unicorn cannot be in the forest at the same time.\n\n* **Inference we're testing:** If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest. This also means the griffin and unicorn cannot be in the forest at the same time.\n\n* **Are they logically equivalent?**  Both statements express the same idea: the griffin and unicorn cannot coexist in the forest.  \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
