            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim. This is a conditional statement, where \"shirt was cotton\" is the hypothesis and \"pants were not denim\" is the conclusion.\n\n* **Inference we're testing:** If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton. This is also a conditional statement.\n\n* **Relationship:** The inference we're testing is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by switching the hypothesis and conclusion, and negating both.\n\n* **Logical equivalence:** A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\n**Answer: Yes** \n"
