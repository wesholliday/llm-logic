            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the car was red, then the truck was not blue. This is a conditional statement. It tells us that IF the car is red, THEN the truck cannot be blue. \n\n* **Inference we're testing:** If the truck was blue, then the car was not red. This is also a conditional statement.\n\n* **Relationship:**  The inference is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by switching the hypothesis and conclusion, and negating both. \n\n* **Logical equivalence:** The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\n**Answer: Yes** \n"
