            "content": "Let's break down this logic problem:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den. This is a conditional statement, often written as \"If P, then Q\" where:\n    * P: The bear was in the cave\n    * Q: The wolf was not in the den\n\n* **What we want to infer:** If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave. This is like flipping and negating the original statement, making it \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n* **Logical equivalence:**  In logic, the statement \"If P, then Q\" is logically equivalent to \"If not Q, then not P\". This is called the contrapositive.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
