We can represent this as: P -> NOT T\n\n* **Contrapositive:**  The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent. To form the contrapositive, we reverse the elements and negate them both. The contrapositive of the original statement is:  If Erin took a train (T), then Sam did not take a plane (NOT P). This is represented as: T -> NOT P\n\n* **Are they the same?** The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement. Since the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, the answer is yes.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
