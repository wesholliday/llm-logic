There's no obligation or certainty they did.\n\n* **Question:** Can we infer that the alien MIGHT NOT have visited Mars?\n* **What this is asking:** Is it a possibility, given the premise, that the alien skipped Mars?\n\nSince the premise already establishes the possibility of the alien not visiting Mars, we can infer that it's a possibility.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
