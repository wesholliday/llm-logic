There's room for the possibility that he didn't. \n* **\"Jeff might not have played basketball\"**  means it's possible that Jeff didn't play basketball.\n\nSince the first statement allows for the possibility of Jeff not playing, it logically follows that the second statement is true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
