There's room for other possibilities.\n* **\"The griffin MIGHT NOT have been in the forest\"** means it's possible the griffin wasn't in the forest. \n\nSince the first statement allows for possibilities other than the griffin being in the forest, it does imply the second statement.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
