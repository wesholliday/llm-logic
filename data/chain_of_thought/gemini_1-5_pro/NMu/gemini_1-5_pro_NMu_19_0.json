There are other possibilities.\n* **\"The watch MIGHT NOT be charging on the dresser\"** means it's possible the watch is not charging on the dresser. \n\nSince the first statement opens up possibilities beyond the watch charging on the dresser, it does allow for the possibility that it's not charging there.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
