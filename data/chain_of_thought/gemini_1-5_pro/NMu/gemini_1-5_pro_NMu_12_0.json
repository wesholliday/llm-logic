There are other possibilities.\n* **\"The jacket MIGHT NOT be draped over the chair\"** means it's possible the jacket isn't on the chair. \n\nSince the first statement allows for possibilities other than the jacket being on the chair, it follows that the jacket might not be on the chair.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
