There's room for it to NOT be there. \n* **\"The newspaper MIGHT NOT be in the driveway\"**  means there's a possibility the newspaper isn't there.\n\nSince the first statement allows for the possibility of the newspaper not being in the driveway, the second statement is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
