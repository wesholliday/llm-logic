There might have been other options available to her.\n* **\"Sue might not have chosen pizza\"** suggests that there's a possibility Sue opted for something else. \n\nSince the first statement opens up the possibility of Sue choosing something other than pizza, it logically follows that Sue might not have chosen pizza. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
