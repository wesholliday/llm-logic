There's a possibility it's somewhere else.\n* **\"The milk MIGHT NOT be on the counter\"**: This means there's a possibility the milk is not on the counter. \n\nSince both statements allow for the possibility of the milk being somewhere other than the counter, they convey the same idea.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
