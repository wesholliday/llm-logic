It doesn't confirm anyone else wrote it, just that it's not certain James did.\n\n* **\"The book might not have been written by James\"**  expresses the same possibility \u2013 that James isn't necessarily the author.\n\nSince both statements convey the same uncertainty about James' authorship, they are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
