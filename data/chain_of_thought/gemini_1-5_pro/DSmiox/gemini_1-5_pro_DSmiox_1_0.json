This means it's possible the flugel is not zargled, but doesn't guarantee it.\n\n* **Statement 2:** Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled. This presents two exclusive possibilities:\n    * **Possibility 1:** The flugel is blimmed.\n    * **Possibility 2:** The flugel is zargled.\n\nNow let's consider how the statements interact. Statement 1 allows for the possibility that the flugel is NOT zargled. If the flugel is NOT zargled, then according to Statement 2, it MUST be blimmed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flugel is blimmed.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
