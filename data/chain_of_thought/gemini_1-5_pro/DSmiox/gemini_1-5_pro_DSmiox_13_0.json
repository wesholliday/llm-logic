The glip can only be one or the other.\n\nNow let's combine the information:\n\n* Statement 1 leaves open the possibility that the glip IS tragged. \n* If the glip IS tragged, statement 2 tells us it cannot be slogged.\n* Since we don't know for sure if the glip is tragged or not, we can't definitively say it's slogged.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
