This means it's possible the grommet is not plopped.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped. This gives us two options, and one of them *must* be true.\n\nNow let's consider if the grommet is not plopped (from Premise 1).\n\n* If the grommet is not plopped, then according to Premise 2, it *must* be sploffed for the premise to hold true. \n\nTherefore, even if the grommet might not be plopped, we can still definitively say...\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
