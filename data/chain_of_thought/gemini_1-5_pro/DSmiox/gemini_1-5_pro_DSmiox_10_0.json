This means it's possible the wug is not garpled, but doesn't guarantee it.\n\n* **Statement 2:** Either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled. This presents two mutually exclusive possibilities, one of which must be true.\n\nNow let's consider if we can infer \"The wug is sproinged\":\n\n* If the wug is NOT garpled (as Statement 1 allows), then Statement 2 forces the wug to be sproinged. \n\n* However, if the wug IS garpled (Statement 1 doesn't prevent this), then we learn nothing about whether it's sproinged.\n\nSince we have a scenario where the conclusion doesn't hold, we cannot definitively infer \"The wug is sproinged\".\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
