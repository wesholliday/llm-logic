This means it's possible the smonk is plagged, or it's possible it isn't.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged. This gives us two possibilities:\n    * **Possibility A:** The smonk is vreebled.\n    * **Possibility B:** The smonk is plagged. \n\n* **Analyzing the Possibilities:**\n    * Premise 1 allows for both Possibility A and Possibility B. \n    * Premise 2 says one of those possibilities MUST be true.\n\nSince Premise 1 doesn't rule out either option presented in Premise 2, we can't definitively say the smonk IS vreebled. It COULD be plagged instead.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
