This means it's possible the twonk is not plinked, but doesn't guarantee it.\n\n* **Statement 2:** Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked. This presents two options, and at least one must be true.\n\nNow let's consider if the twonk is not plinked (from statement 1). If that's the case, then according to statement 2, it MUST be varnished for the statement to hold true.\n\nHowever, statement 1 only says the twonk MIGHT not be plinked. It's still possible the twonk IS plinked. In that case, the second statement is still true (one option is fulfilled), and the twonk doesn't need to be varnished.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively say the twonk is varnished.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
