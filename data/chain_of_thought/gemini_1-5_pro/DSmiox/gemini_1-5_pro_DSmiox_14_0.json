This means it's possible the clug is not snugged, but doesn't guarantee it.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the clug is fleeked or it must be snugged. This gives us two possibilities: \n    * **Possibility 1:** The clug is fleeked.\n    * **Possibility 2:** The clug is snugged.\n\nNow let's consider if Statement 1 affects the possibilities from Statement 2:\n\n* Statement 1 says the clug *might* not be snugged. This doesn't rule out Possibility 2 from Statement 2 (that the clug IS snugged). \n* Since Possibility 2 is still on the table, we can't definitively say the clug MUST be fleeked (Possibility 1).\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
