This means it's possible the zinger is NOT smuggled.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smuggled. This gives us two possibilities:\n    * **Possibility A:** The zinger is fraggled.\n    * **Possibility B:** The zinger is smuggled. \n* **Combining the information:** Premise 1 tells us the zinger might NOT be smuggled.  If the zinger is NOT smuggled (as Premise 1 allows), then Premise 2 forces us to accept Possibility A: the zinger is fraggled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
