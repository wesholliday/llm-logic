This means it's possible the whiffle isn't tinked, but it doesn't guarantee it. \n\n* **Statement 2:** Either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked. This gives us two possibilities:\n    * **Possibility 1:** The whiffle is shanked.\n    * **Possibility 2:** The whiffle is tinked.\n\nNow let's consider how the statements interact. Statement 1 says the whiffle *might not* be tinked. This eliminates Possibility 2 from Statement 2. \n\nIf Possibility 2 is eliminated, the only remaining possibility is Possibility 1: The whiffle is shanked.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
