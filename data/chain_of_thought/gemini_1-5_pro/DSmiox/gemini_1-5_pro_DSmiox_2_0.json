If this is true, then according to Statement 2, the wug MUST be flooped for the statement to hold.\n* **Possibility 2:** The wug is bimmed. This would satisfy Statement 2, but it doesn't tell us anything about whether the wug is flooped or not.\n\nSince we can definitively conclude the wug is flooped in one of the possibilities, but not the other, we cannot definitively say 'The wug is flooped'.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
