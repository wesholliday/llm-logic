This means it's possible the sprocket is NOT daggled.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled. This gives us two possibilities, and one MUST be true.\n\nNow let's consider if we can conclude \"The sprocket is cranked\":\n\n* **Scenario 1: Sprocket is NOT daggled.**  Premise 2 says it MUST be cranked in this case.\n* **Scenario 2: Sprocket IS daggled.** This contradicts Premise 1, which allows for the possibility of it NOT being daggled.\n\nSince we can't rule out the possibility of the sprocket being daggled, we can't definitively say it MUST be cranked.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
