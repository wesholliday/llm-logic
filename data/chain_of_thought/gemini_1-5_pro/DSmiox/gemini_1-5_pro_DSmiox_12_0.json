This means it's possible the smip is not lupped, but doesn't guarantee it.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped. This gives us two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n\nNow let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1: The smip is not lupped.**  Premise 2 tells us if it's not lupped, it MUST be shripped.\n* **Possibility 2: The smip is lupped.** This aligns with Premise 2's second option, and doesn't tell us anything about whether it's shripped or not.\n\nSince the smip being shripped is the only way to satisfy the premises if the smip is not lupped, we can make the inference.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
