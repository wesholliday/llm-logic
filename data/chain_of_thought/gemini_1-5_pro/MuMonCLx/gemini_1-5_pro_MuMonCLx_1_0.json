However, the sentence structure indicates that for the first part to be true (\"The quimble must be snorkel and flonk a zump\"), both the second part (\"be snorkel\") AND the third part (\"flonk a zump\") must be true.  Therefore, if the whole statement is true, then \"the quimble must be snorkel\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
