The original statement says the quimble must have three qualities: \"bimboozle wobble\", \"snizzle\", and \"at crunk fizzle\". The shortened version only lists one of those qualities: \"bimboozle wobble\". Since the original statement says the quimble must have all three qualities, we can infer that it must also have the first quality by itself. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
