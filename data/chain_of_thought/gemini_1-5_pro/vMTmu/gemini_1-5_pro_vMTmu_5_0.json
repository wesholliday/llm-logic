Modus Tollens follows this pattern:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\n**2.  Match the argument to the pattern:**\n\n* **P:** Jeff played basketball\n* **Q:** Amy must have played tennis\n\nThe argument fits the Modus Tollens pattern perfectly.\n\n**3. Validity of Modus Tollens:**\n\nModus Tollens is a **valid** argument form. This means that *if* the premises are true, the conclusion *must* be true. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
