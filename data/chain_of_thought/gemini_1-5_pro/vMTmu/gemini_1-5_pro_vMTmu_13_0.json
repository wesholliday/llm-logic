This sets up a conditional relationship.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the truck must have been blue. This tells us the second part of the conditional statement in Premise 1 is false.\n* **Conclusion:** The car was not red. The argument is trying to conclude that because the second part of the conditional statement is false, the first part must also be false.\n\nThis is the structure of a valid argument form called *Modus Tollens*.  If we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
