This sets up a conditional relationship.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow. This tells us the \"then\" part of our conditional statement is false.\n* **Conclusion:** The apple was not red. The argument is trying to conclude the \"if\" part of the conditional is false because the \"then\" part is false.\n\nNow, let's consider if this is logically sound.  If the original statement (\"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\") is true, could the conclusion ever be false? \n\nYes, it's possible the apple was red, but something else entirely made the banana not yellow.  \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
