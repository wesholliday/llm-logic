            "content": "Let's break down this argument:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.  (This sets up a conditional relationship)\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry. (This tells us the \"then\" part of Premise 1 is false)\n* **Conclusion:** The cake was not chocolate. (This is what we're trying to determine if it logically follows)\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThis argument structure is called *Modus Tollens*.  Modus Tollens is a valid argument form. Here's why:\n\n* If the original \"if, then\" statement is true, AND\n* We know the \"then\" part is false, THEN\n* The \"if\" part MUST also be false.\n\n**Applying it to our example:**\n\n* **If** the cake was chocolate, **then** the muffins must have been blueberry. (We're assuming this is true for the sake of the argument)\n* The muffins were NOT blueberry.\n* **Therefore**, the cake could NOT have been chocolate.\n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
