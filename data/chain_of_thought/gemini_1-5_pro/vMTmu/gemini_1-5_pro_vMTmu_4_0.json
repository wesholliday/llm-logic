We can symbolize this as:  If A, then B.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter. We can symbolize this as: Not B.\n* **Conclusion:** The alien did not visit Mars. We can symbolize this as: Not A.\n\nNow let's consider the logic:\n\n* If A then B, means that whenever A is true, B must also be true.\n* We are told Not B is true, meaning B is false.\n* If B *must* be true whenever A is true, and we know B is *false*, then A cannot be true. \n\nThis matches the structure of Modus Tollens, a valid argument form.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
