We can represent this as:  If F, then B.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. This negates statement B.\n* **Conclusion:** Tom did not watch football. This negates statement F.\n\nThe argument structure is: If F then B. Not B. Therefore, not F.\n\nThis is the structure of a valid argument form called *Modus Tollens*. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
