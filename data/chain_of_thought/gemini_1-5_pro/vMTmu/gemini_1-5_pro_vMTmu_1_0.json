This is a conditional statement: IF M, THEN S.\n\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This negates the second part of our conditional statement (S).  \n\n* **Conclusion:** Mary was not at the wedding. This negates the first part of our conditional statement (M).\n\nThe argument structure is: If M then S. Not S. Therefore, not M. This is the form of a valid argument known as **Modus Tollens**.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
