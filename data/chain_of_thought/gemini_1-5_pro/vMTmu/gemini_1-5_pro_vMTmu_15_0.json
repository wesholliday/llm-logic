We can represent this as: P \u2192 T\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train. This negates the second part of our first premise: \u00acT\n* **Conclusion:** Sam did not take a plane: \u00acP\n\nWe need to determine if the conclusion *must* be true if the premises are true.  \n\nConsider this: What if Sam took a plane (P), but Erin took a car instead of a train (\u00acT)?  This scenario would make both premises true, but the conclusion (\u00acP) would be false.\n\nSince we found a scenario where the premises are true but the conclusion could be false, the argument is not logically valid.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
