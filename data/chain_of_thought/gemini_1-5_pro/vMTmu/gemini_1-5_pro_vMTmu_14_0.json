We can think of this as \"If A, then B\".\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den. This is the negation of \"B\", so it's \"Not B\".\n* **Conclusion:** The bear was not in the cave. This is the negation of \"A\", so it's \"Not A\".\n\nThe argument structure is: If A, then B. Not B. Therefore, Not A.\n\nThis is the structure of a classic logical argument form called *Modus Tollens*.  Modus Tollens is always valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
