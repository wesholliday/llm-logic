This is a conditional statement.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo (not Q). \n* **Conclusion:** Joe did not go to the park (not P).\n\nWe need to determine if the conclusion *must* be true if the premises are true.  \n\nConsider this: What if Joe went to the park, but Lucy decided to go to the museum instead of the zoo? \n\n* Premise 1 would still be true (If Joe went to the park, *then* Lucy must have gone to the zoo) because it doesn't say what happens if Lucy goes somewhere *else*.\n* Premise 2 would also be true (Lucy didn't go to the zoo).\n\nIn this scenario, both premises are true, but the conclusion (Joe did not go to the park) is false.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
