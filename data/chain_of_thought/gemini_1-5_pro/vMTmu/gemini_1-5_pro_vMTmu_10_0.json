We can represent this as: Dog Inside \u2192 Cat Outside\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the cat must have been outside. This negates the second part of our first premise:  \u00ac Cat Outside\n* **Conclusion:** The dog was not inside: \u00ac Dog Inside\n\nNow let's consider if the conclusion *must* be true if the premises are true.  If the cat wasn't outside, then the first premise tells us the dog couldn't have been inside.  \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
