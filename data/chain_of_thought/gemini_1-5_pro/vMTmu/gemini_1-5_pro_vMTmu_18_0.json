We can symbolize this as:  If P, then Q (where P = doll is plastic, Q = truck is metal).\n\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the truck must have been metal. This negates the second part of our symbolic representation: Not Q.\n\n* **Conclusion:** The doll was not plastic. This negates the first part of our symbolic representation: Not P.\n\nSo we have:\n\n* If P, then Q\n* Not Q\n* Therefore, Not P\n\nThis is a classic argument form known as *Modus Tollens*. Modus Tollens is a **valid** argument form. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
