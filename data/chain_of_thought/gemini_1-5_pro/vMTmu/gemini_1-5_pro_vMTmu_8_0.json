We can represent this as:  V \u2192 M\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake. This negates M:  \u00acM\n* **Conclusion:** The vampire was not awake: \u00acV\n\nWe need to determine if the conclusion *must* be true if the premises are true.  \n\nConsider this: What if the vampire was asleep (\u00acV), but the mummy was still awake (M)? This scenario would make Premise 1 true (a false statement implying a true statement is still true) and Premise 2 false. \n\nSince we've found a scenario where the premises could be true and the conclusion false, the argument is not logically valid.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
