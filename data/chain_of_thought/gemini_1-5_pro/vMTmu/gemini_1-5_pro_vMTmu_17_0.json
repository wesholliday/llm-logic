(If P, then Q)\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad. (Not Q)\n* **Conclusion:** Ben did not eat pasta. (Not P)\n\nThis argument structure follows a classic logical form called *Modus Tollens*.  Modus Tollens states that if we know \"If P, then Q\" is true, and we also know \"Not Q\" is true, then we can logically conclude \"Not P\".\n\nIn our example:\n\n1. We are given \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad\" (If P, then Q).\n2. We are given \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad\" (Not Q).\n3. Therefore, we can validly conclude \"Ben did not eat pasta\" (Not P).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
