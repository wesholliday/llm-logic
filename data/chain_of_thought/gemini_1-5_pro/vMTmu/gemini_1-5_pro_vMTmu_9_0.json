We can represent this as: If R, then B.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This negates the second part of our first premise: Not B.\n* **Conclusion:** Lisa did not buy the red shirt: Not R.\n\nNow let's consider if the conclusion *must* be true if the premises are true.  If Lisa didn't buy the red shirt (Not R), then Premise 1 is still true (since it only states what happens *if* Lisa bought the shirt).  Importantly, Premise 2 (Not B) can also still be true.\n\nSince the premises can be true and the conclusion false, this argument form is not logically valid.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
