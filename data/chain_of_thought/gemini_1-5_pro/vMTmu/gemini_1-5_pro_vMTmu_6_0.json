            "content": "Here's how to break down the argument:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.  (This sets up a conditional relationship)\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta. (This contradicts the second part of Premise 1)\n* **Conclusion:** Sue did not choose pizza. (This is what we're trying to determine if it logically follows)\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThis argument structure is a valid form called *Modus Tollens*.  Here's why:\n\n* Modus Tollens states: If P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n* In our argument:\n    * P = Sue chose pizza\n    * Q = Bob must have chosen pasta\n\nSince Premise 2 tells us \"Not Q\" (Bob didn't have to choose pasta), we can validly conclude \"Not P\" (Sue did not choose pizza).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
