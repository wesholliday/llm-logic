We can symbolize this as:  If A, then C.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race. We can symbolize this as: Not C.\n* **Conclusion:** Alex did not finish the race. We can symbolize this as: Not A.\n\nNow let's consider the logic:\n\n* **Scenario 1:**  If Alex DID finish the race (A is true), and Premise 1 holds (If A, then C), then Chris MUST have finished the race (C is true).  But Premise 2 tells us Chris did NOT necessarily finish the race (Not C). This creates a contradiction.\n\n* **Scenario 2:** If Alex did NOT finish the race (Not A), then Premise 1 (If A, then C) doesn't really tell us anything definitive about whether Chris finished. Chris might have finished for some other reason, or not.  This scenario aligns with both premises without contradiction.\n\nSince we can find a scenario where the premises are true and the conclusion could also be true, the argument holds.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
