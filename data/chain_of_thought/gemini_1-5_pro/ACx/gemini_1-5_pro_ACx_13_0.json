This is a conditional statement, like saying \"If it rains, then the ground is wet.\"\n* **Statement 2:** The glip was tragged. This tells us the second part of our conditional statement is true.\n\nHowever, just because the ground is wet doesn't mean it rained (maybe someone sprayed a hose).  Similarly, knowing the glip was tragged doesn't automatically mean it was slogged. There might be other ways a glip could become tragged.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
