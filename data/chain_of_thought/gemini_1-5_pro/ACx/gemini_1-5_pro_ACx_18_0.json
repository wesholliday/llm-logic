This is a conditional statement, like saying \"If it rains, then the ground is wet.\"\n* **Statement 2:** The shank was nugged. This tells us the second part of our conditional statement is true.\n\nHowever, just because the ground is wet doesn't mean it rained. There could be other reasons for wet ground.  Similarly, just because the shank was nugged doesn't automatically mean it was plooked. There might be other ways a shank can become nugged.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
