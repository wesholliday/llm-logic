We know Q is true. Can we conclude P is true?\n\nHere's why we can't:\n\n1. **\"If P, then Q\" doesn't mean \"If Q, then P\".** Just because the wug bimmed the zoint after being flooped, doesn't mean it *always* bims the zoint after being flooped. \n2. **There could be other reasons for the wug to bim the zoint.** Maybe the wug bims the zoint for other reasons besides being flooped.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
