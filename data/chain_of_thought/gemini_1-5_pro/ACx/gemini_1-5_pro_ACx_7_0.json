This is a conditional statement, meaning it sets up a relationship where the first part (the whiffle was shanked) is the condition, and the second part (the whiffle tinked) is the result. \n* **Statement 2:** The whiffle tinked. This tells us the result from the first statement is true.\n\nHowever, just because we know the result is true, we can't automatically assume the condition is also true.  There might be other reasons why the whiffle tinked.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine this statement: \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\"\n\n* We see the ground is wet (result).\n* Does this mean it MUST be raining (condition)? No, the ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled something, etc.).\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
