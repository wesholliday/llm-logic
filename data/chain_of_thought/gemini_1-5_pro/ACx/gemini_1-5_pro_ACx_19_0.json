However, we can still analyze the logic of the statements.\n\n* **Think of it like a cause and effect relationship.**  The first statement says \"If this thing happened (smonk was vreebled), then this other thing happened (smonk plagged).\"\n\n* **The second statement only tells us the effect happened.** It doesn't say anything about the cause.\n\n* **Could the effect happen without the cause?**  Maybe!  There might be other reasons why the smonk plagged.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
