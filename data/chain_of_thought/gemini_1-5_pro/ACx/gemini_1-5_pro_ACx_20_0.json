However, we can still analyze the logic of the statements.\n\n* **Think of it like a classic \"if, then\" statement.**  For example, \"If it rains, then the ground is wet.\"\n\n* **We're given:**\n    * If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n    * The fleeg surned.\n\n* **The problem is this:** Just because the ground is wet, doesn't mean it rained. Maybe someone used a sprinkler.  Similarly, just because the fleeg surned, doesn't automatically mean it was bluttered. There might be other reasons it surned.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
