It doesn't matter if \"sneg\", \"crampled\", \"sproted\", or \"frink\" have real-world meanings.\n\n* **We have a conditional statement:** \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\" This has the form \"If P, then Q\" where:\n    * P = \"the sneg was crampled\"\n    * Q = \"the sneg sproted the frink\"\n\n* **We are given the second part of the conditional (Q) as true.**\n\n* **We are asked if we can infer the first part of the conditional (P) is true.**\n\n**Here's the key:**  Knowing that Q is true (\"the sneg sproted the frink\") does NOT automatically mean P is true (\"the sneg was crampled\").  \n\n**Example:**  Imagine the statement \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\"  If you see the ground is wet, can you be certain it rained? No, something else could have made it wet.\n\n**Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The sneg was crampled\".**\n\nAnswer: no \n"
