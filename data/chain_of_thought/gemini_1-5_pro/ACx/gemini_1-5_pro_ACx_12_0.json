There might be other reasons for the smip to lup the zoint.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine this statement: \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\"\n\nNow, if we know the ground is wet, can we conclude it's raining? No, because the ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled something, etc.).\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
