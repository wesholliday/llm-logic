Knowing \"If P, then Q\" and \"Q\" does not guarantee \"P\". This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. \n\n**Example:** If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).  Just because the ground is wet (Q) doesn't mean it's necessarily raining (P) \u2013 it could be from sprinklers!\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
