This sets up a conditional relationship where \"sproinged\" implies \"garpled\".\n* **Statement 2:** The wug was garpled. This tells us the effect (\"garpled\") occurred.\n\nHowever, just because the effect happened doesn't mean the specific cause (\"sproinged\") is the reason.  There could be other ways the wug could have been garpled. \n\n**Answer:** no \n"
