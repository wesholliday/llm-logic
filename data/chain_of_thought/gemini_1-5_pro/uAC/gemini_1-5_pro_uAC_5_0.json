It doesn't mean Jeff *did* play basketball, only that *if* he did, then Amy played tennis.\n* **Statement 2:** Amy played tennis. This tells us Amy played tennis, but it doesn't tell us anything about whether Jeff played basketball.\n\n**Reasoning:**  Just because Amy played tennis doesn't mean Jeff played basketball.  Amy could have played tennis for other reasons. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
