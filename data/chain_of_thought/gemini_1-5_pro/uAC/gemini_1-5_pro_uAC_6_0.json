It doesn't mean Sue *did* choose pizza, just that *if* she did, then Bob chose pasta.\n* **Statement 2:** Bob chose pasta. This tells us Bob's choice, but doesn't directly reveal anything about Sue's choice.\n\n**Reasoning:** Just because Bob chose pasta doesn't mean Sue *must* have chosen pizza.  There could be other reasons Bob chose pasta. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
