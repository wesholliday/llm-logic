Notice that Statement 1 only tells us what happens IF Lisa bought the red shirt. It doesn't guarantee she did. \n\nWhile Mark buying the blue shirt aligns with Statement 1, it could have happened even if Lisa didn't buy the red shirt. There might be other reasons Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
