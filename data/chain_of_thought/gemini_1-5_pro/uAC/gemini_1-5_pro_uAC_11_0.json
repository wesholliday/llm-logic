This looks like a classic logic puzzle, but it has a tricky element.  Just because the muffins were blueberry doesn't automatically mean the cake *must* have been chocolate. There could be other reasons the muffins were blueberry.\n\n**Example:** Imagine the rule was \"If it's raining, I'll wear a coat.\"  Just because you see me wearing a coat doesn't mean it *must* be raining. I might wear a coat for other reasons.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
