It doesn't mean Ben *always* eats pasta, just that *if* he does, Kate will eat salad.\n* **Statement 2:** Kate ate salad. This tells us something happened, but doesn't reveal why.\n* **The Question:** Can we be sure Ben ate pasta?  Since Kate eating salad could be caused by other things besides Ben eating pasta, we can't assume the first part of the conditional statement is true.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
