It doesn't mean Tom *did* watch football, just that *if* he did, then Jen watched basketball.\n* **Statement 2:** Jen watched basketball. This tells us something happened, but it doesn't tell us *why* Jen watched basketball.\n\n**Reasoning:** Just because we know Jen watched basketball doesn't mean we can automatically assume Tom watched football.  There could be other reasons why Jen watched basketball.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
