It doesn't mean Joe *always* goes to the park. It just means *if* he does, then Lucy goes to the zoo.\n* **Statement 2:** Lucy went to the zoo. This tells us Lucy went to the zoo, but it doesn't tell us anything about Joe.\n\n**Reasoning:**  Just because Lucy went to the zoo doesn't mean Joe went to the park.  Maybe Lucy goes to the zoo all the time, regardless of Joe's actions. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
