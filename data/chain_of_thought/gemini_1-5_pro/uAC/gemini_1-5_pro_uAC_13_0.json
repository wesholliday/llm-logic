It doesn't mean the car *was* red, just that *if* it was, *then* the truck was blue.\n* **Statement 2:** The truck was blue. This tells us a fact about the truck, but it doesn't automatically tell us anything about the car.\n\n**Reasoning:**  Just because the truck was blue doesn't mean the car *had* to be red.  The original statement only told us what would happen if the car *were* red. There could be other reasons the truck was blue.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
