Notice that Statement 1 only tells us what happens if the shirt *is* cotton. It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the shirt is *not* cotton.  The pants being denim doesn't automatically mean the shirt must be cotton. There could be other situations where the pants are denim.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
