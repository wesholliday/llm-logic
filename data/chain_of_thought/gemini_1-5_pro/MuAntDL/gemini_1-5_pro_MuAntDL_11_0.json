It asserts at least one of the possibilities must be true, but it allows for either one, or even both, to be true.  Therefore, we cannot definitively say that the software MUST have been updated, as the possibility of it being reinstalled (without being updated) still satisfies the original statement. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
