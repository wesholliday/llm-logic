It only tells us what happens IF the sprocket was cranked. \n* **Crucially, Premise 1 tells us the sprocket was NOT cranked.**  Since the condition in Premise 2 is not met, we can't conclude anything definitive about the sprocket being daggled or not. It's possible the sprocket could be daggled even if it wasn't cranked.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
