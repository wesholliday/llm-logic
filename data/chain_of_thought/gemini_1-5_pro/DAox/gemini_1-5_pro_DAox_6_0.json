It only tells us what happens IF the grommet was sploffed.  Since Premise 1 tells us the grommet was NOT sploffed, we can't conclude anything about the grommet plopping the frink.  \n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine this scenario:\n\n* **Sploffing:**  Means to be painted blue.\n* **Plopping the frink:** Means to eat a cookie.\n\n1. **The grommet did not sploff (was not painted blue).**\n2. **If the grommet was sploffed (painted blue), then the grommet plopped the frink (ate a cookie).**\n\nJust because the grommet wasn't painted blue doesn't mean it didn't eat a cookie! It could have eaten a cookie for other reasons.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
