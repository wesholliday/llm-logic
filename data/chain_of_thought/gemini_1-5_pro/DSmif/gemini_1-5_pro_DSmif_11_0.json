This presents two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** The newspaper might not be sitting on the porch. This introduces uncertainty to the first possibility presented in Statement 1. \n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nWhile Statement 2 casts doubt on the newspaper being on the porch, it doesn't eliminate that possibility entirely.  The newspaper could still be on the porch.  Therefore, we cannot definitively say the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
