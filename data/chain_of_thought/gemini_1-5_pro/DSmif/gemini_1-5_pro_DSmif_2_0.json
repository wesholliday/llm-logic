This presents two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** The book might not be resting on the table. This introduces uncertainty about one of the possibilities in Statement 1. \n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nWhile Statement 2 casts doubt on the book being on the table, it doesn't eliminate that possibility entirely.  The book *might* not be on the table, meaning it could be elsewhere, or it still could be on the table. \n\nSince the first statement says the book MUST be on either the table or the shelf, and we haven't definitively ruled out the table, we can't definitively conclude the book is on the shelf.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
