It doesn't rule out the possibility of the milk being in the fridge, but it suggests it's not a certainty.\n\nSince the milk might not be in the fridge (Statement 2), and Statement 1 tells us it must be either in the fridge or on the counter, we can logically conclude that the milk must be on the counter. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
