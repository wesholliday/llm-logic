This presents two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** Fido might not be in the garden. This introduces uncertainty about one of the possibilities in Statement 1. \n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nWhile Statement 2 casts doubt on Fido being in the garden, it doesn't rule it out completely.  Since Statement 1 says Fido MUST be in one of the two locations, if we're not absolutely sure he's NOT in the garden, we can't definitively say he's inside.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
