This tells us there are only two possibilities.\n* **Statement 2:** The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf. This introduces uncertainty about one of the possibilities. \n\nSince the first statement says the toy MUST be in one of the two locations, and the second statement only casts doubt on one location, we are left with the other location as the remaining certainty.\n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
