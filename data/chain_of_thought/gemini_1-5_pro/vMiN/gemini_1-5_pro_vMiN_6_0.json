This means there's a possibility Sue chose something else.\n* **Conclusion:** It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza. This means it wasn't absolutely necessary for Sue to choose pizza.\n\nNow let's consider if the premise guarantees the conclusion:\n\n* **If there's a possibility Sue chose something else (premise), then it couldn't have been absolutely necessary for her to choose pizza (conclusion).** \n\nThe premise directly supports the conclusion. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
