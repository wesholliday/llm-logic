This means it's possible the griffin was not in the forest.\n* **Conclusion:** It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest. This means it wasn't absolutely necessary for the griffin to be in the forest.\n\nNow let's consider the relationship between possibility and necessity:\n\n* If something is possible, it doesn't mean it's necessary. \n* If something is not necessary, it could still be possible.\n\nTherefore, if it's possible the griffin wasn't in the forest, then it's not necessary that the griffin was in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
