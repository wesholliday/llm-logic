This leaves open the possibility that James did write it, but it's not certain.\n* **Conclusion:** It's *not* the case that the book *must* have been written by James. This states that it's not absolutely certain that James wrote the book.\n\nNow let's consider the relationship between the premise and conclusion:\n\n* **If the premise is true** (it's possible James *didn't* write the book), **then the conclusion must also be true** (it's not guaranteed that James *did* write the book). \n\nSince a true premise leads to a true conclusion in all possible scenarios, this argument form is valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
