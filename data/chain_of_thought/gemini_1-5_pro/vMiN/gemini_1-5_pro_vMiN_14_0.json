This leaves open the possibility that the milk is elsewhere.\n* **Conclusion:** It's *not the case* that the milk *must* be on the counter. This means the milk being on the counter is not absolutely certain.\n\nThe premise allows for uncertainty about the milk's location.  The conclusion simply states that the milk's presence on the counter is not guaranteed. Since the premise allows for the possibility of the conclusion being true, the argument is logically valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
