This implies there's a possibility they are elsewhere.\n* **Conclusion:** It's *not the case* that the shoes *must* be in the closet. This means it's not absolutely certain the shoes are in the closet.\n\nThe premise allows for the possibility of the shoes being somewhere else.  If there's even a chance they are elsewhere, then it cannot be definitively stated that they *must* be in the closet. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
