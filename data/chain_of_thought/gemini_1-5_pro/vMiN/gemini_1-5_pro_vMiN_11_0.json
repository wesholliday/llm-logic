This implies there's a possibility it's not there.\n* **Conclusion:** It's *not the case* that the newspaper *must* be in the driveway. This means it's not absolutely certain the newspaper is there.\n\nThe premise allows for the possibility of the newspaper not being in the driveway.  If there's even a chance it's not there, then it cannot be definitively stated that the newspaper *must* be in the driveway. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
