This leaves open the possibility that it IS charging on the dresser, but it's not certain.\n* **Conclusion:** It's *not the case* that the watch *must* be charging on the dresser.  This means it's not absolutely certain that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nThe premise allows for uncertainty. The conclusion states there isn't absolute certainty. Since a lack of certainty aligns with the possibility of something not being true, the argument holds.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
