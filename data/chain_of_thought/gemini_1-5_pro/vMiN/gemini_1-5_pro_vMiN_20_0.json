This leaves open the possibility that they are in the bag, but it's not certain.\n* **Conclusion:** It's *not the case* that the sunglasses *must* be in her bag. This states that it's not absolutely certain the sunglasses are in the bag.\n\nThe premise allows for uncertainty. The conclusion states there isn't absolute certainty. Since a lack of certainty supports the idea that something is not a guaranteed must, the argument follows logically.\n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
