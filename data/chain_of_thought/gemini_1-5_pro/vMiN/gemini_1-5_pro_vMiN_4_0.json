This implies there's a possibility the alien didn't visit Mars.\n* **Conclusion:** It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars. This means it wasn't absolutely necessary for the alien to have visited Mars.\n\nNow let's consider if the premise guarantees the conclusion:\n\n* **If there's a possibility the alien didn't visit Mars, does that mean it wasn't absolutely necessary for the alien to have visited Mars?** Yes, if something wasn't necessary, it means there are other possibilities.\n\nTherefore:\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
