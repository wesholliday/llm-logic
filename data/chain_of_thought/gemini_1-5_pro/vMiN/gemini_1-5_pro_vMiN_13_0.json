This leaves open the possibility that the toy is somewhere else.\n* **Conclusion:** It's *not the case* that the toy *must* be in the toy box.  This means it's not absolutely certain the toy is in the toy box.\n\nThe premise allows for the possibility of the toy being outside the toy box.  If there's even a chance the toy is elsewhere, then it's not guaranteed to be in the toy box.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
