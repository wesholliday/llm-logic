This leaves open the possibility that it IS in the drawer, but it's not certain.\n* **Conclusion:** It's *not* the case that the notebook *must* be in the drawer.  This is saying there's no guarantee the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nThe premise allows for uncertainty about the notebook's location. The conclusion reflects that same uncertainty by saying it's not a sure thing the notebook is in the drawer. \n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premise, \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
