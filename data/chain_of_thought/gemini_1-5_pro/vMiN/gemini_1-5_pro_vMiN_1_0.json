This leaves open the possibility that she was there, but doesn't confirm it.\n* **Conclusion:** It's *not the case* that Mary *must* have been at the wedding. This says there isn't a requirement for Mary to have been there.\n\nThe premise allows for uncertainty about Mary's presence. The conclusion states there's no obligation for her to be there.  Since the premise doesn't definitively place Mary at the wedding, it supports the conclusion that her presence wasn't mandatory.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
