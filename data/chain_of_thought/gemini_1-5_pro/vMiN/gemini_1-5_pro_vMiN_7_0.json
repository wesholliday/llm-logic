This leaves open the possibility that Alex did finish, but also the possibility that Alex did not.\n* **Conclusion:** It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race. This states that it is not absolutely certain that Alex finished the race.\n\nThe premise allows for uncertainty about whether Alex finished the race. The conclusion simply states that it's not guaranteed Alex finished. Since the premise allows for the conclusion to be true, the argument is logically valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
