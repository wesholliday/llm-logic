This leaves open the possibility that it is NOT on the chair.\n* **Conclusion:** It's *not* the case that the jacket *must* be draped over the chair. This means it's not absolutely certain the jacket is on the chair.\n\n**Reasoning:** If something is not necessarily true (the jacket might not be on the chair), then it cannot be absolutely, definitely true (it must be on the chair). \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
