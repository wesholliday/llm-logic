This leaves open the possibility that she did buy it, but it's not certain.\n* **Conclusion:** It's *not the case* that Lisa *must* have bought the red shirt. This means it's not absolutely certain that she bought the shirt.\n\nSince the premise allows for uncertainty about Lisa buying the shirt, it logically follows that we can't be absolutely certain she did. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
