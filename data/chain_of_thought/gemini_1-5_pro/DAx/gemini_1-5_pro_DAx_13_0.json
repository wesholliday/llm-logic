(Not A)\n\nWe need to determine if we can conclude:\n\n* **Conclusion:** The glip was not tragged. (Not B)\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThis follows the structure of a common logical fallacy called \"Denying the Antecedent\".  Just because the glip wasn't slogged doesn't automatically mean it wasn't tragged. There might be other ways for the glip to be tragged. \n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine \"glip\" is \"grass\", \"slogged\" is \"rained on\", and \"tragged\" is \"wet\".\n\n* If the grass was rained on, then the grass is wet. (True)\n* The grass was not rained on. (Could be true)\n* Can we conclude the grass is not wet? No.  Something else could have made it wet (sprinklers, dew, etc.).\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
