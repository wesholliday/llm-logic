(This is a standard \"if, then\" statement)\n* **Premise 2:** The fleeg was not bluttered. \n* **Conclusion:** The fleeg did not surn.\n\nHere's why we can't make that inference:\n\n* Premise 1 only tells us what happens *if* the fleeg was bluttered. It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the fleeg was *not* bluttered. \n* It's possible the fleeg could surn for other reasons, even if it wasn't bluttered.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
