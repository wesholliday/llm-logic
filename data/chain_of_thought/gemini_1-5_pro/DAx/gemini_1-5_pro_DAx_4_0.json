It doesn't matter what they mean specifically.\n* **We have a conditional statement:** \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\" This means snurgling is enough to guarantee crinkling.\n* **We also have a fact:** \"The fribble was not snurgled.\"\n\nNow, does the lack of snurgling automatically mean no crinkling? Not necessarily. The fribble could have crinkled for some other reason. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
