(Not C)\n\nWe need to determine if we can logically conclude:\n\n* **Conclusion:** The sprocket was not daggled. (Not D)\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThis follows the structure of a valid argument form called *Modus Tollens*.  Modus Tollens states:\n\n* If P, then Q\n* Not P\n* Therefore, Not Q\n\nOur example fits this form:\n\n* If cranked (P), then daggled (Q)\n* Not cranked (Not P)\n* Therefore, not daggled (Not Q)\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
