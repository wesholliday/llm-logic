This sets up a conditional relationship: sproinged \u2192 garpled.\n* **Statement 2:** The wug was not sproinged. This tells us the condition in Statement 1 is false.\n\nNow, if the condition of an \"if-then\" statement is false, can we conclude anything definitive about the second part?  No. The wug could still be garpled for some other reason. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
