This is a conditional statement, like saying \"If it rains, then the ground gets wet.\"\n* **Statement 2:** The wug was not flooped. This tells us the condition in the first statement is not met.\n\nThink back to the rain example. If we know it didn't rain, can we say for sure whether the ground is wet or not? No, because something else might have made the ground wet. \n\nSimilarly, just because the wug wasn't flooped doesn't automatically mean it didn't bim the zoint. There might be other reasons the wug would bim the zoint.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
