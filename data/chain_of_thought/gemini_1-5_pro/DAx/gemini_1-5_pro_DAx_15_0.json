(This is a conditional statement, like \"If it rains, then the ground is wet.\")\n* **Premise 2:** The dreb was not vroombed. \n* **Conclusion:** The dreb was not spened.\n\nConsider this: If the ground is not wet, can we conclude it didn't rain? No, something else could have dried the ground.  Similarly, just because the dreb wasn't vroombed doesn't automatically mean it wasn't spened. There might be other ways for a dreb to be spened.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
