This is a conditional statement, meaning it only guarantees the second part (zargled) if the first part (blimmed) is true. \n* **Statement 2:** The flugel was not blimmed. This tells us the condition in the first statement is false.\n\nSince the condition in the first statement is false, we cannot conclude anything definitive about whether the flugel was zargled. The first statement only tells us what happens if the flugel *was* blimmed. It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if it wasn't.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
