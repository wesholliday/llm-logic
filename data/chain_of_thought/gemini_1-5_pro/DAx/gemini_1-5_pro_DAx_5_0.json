This is a conditional statement, like saying \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\"\n* **Statement 2:** The zinger was not fraggled. This tells us the \"if\" part of our conditional statement is false.\n\nNow, think about the rain analogy. If the ground isn't wet, does that mean it's not raining? Not necessarily! There could be other reasons the ground is dry.\n\nSimilarly, just because the zinger wasn't fraggled doesn't automatically mean it wasn't smoogled. There might be other ways a zinger can be smoogled.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
