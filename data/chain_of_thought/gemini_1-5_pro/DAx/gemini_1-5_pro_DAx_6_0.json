This is a conditional statement, like \"If A, then B\".\n* **Statement 2:** The grommet was not sploffed. This tells us \"A\" is false.\n\nIn a conditional statement, if the \"If\" part (A) is false, we cannot make any conclusions about the \"then\" part (B).  It doesn't matter whether B is true or false, the original statement still holds.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
