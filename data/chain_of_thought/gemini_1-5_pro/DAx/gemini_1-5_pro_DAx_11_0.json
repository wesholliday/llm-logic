This is a conditional statement, like saying \"If it rains, then the ground is wet.\"\n* **Statement 2:** The flug was not blummed. This tells us the \"if\" part of our conditional statement is false.\n\nNow, think about the rain example. If we know it didn't rain, does that tell us anything about whether the ground is wet? Not necessarily! The ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, a spilled drink, etc.).\n\nSimilarly, just because the flug wasn't blummed doesn't automatically mean it wasn't zimmed. There might be other ways for a flug to get zimmed.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
