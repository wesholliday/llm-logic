This is a conditional statement, like \"If it rains, then the ground is wet.\"\n* **Statement 2:** The smonk was not vreebled. This tells us the \"if\" part of our conditional statement is false.\n\nNow, think about the rain example. If it didn't rain, does that mean the ground *must* be dry? No, it could be wet for other reasons. \n\nSimilarly, just because the smonk wasn't vreebled doesn't automatically mean it wasn't plagged. There might be other ways for a smonk to be plagged.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
