This is a conditional statement, like \"If it rains, then the ground is wet.\"\n* **Statement 2:** The whiffle was not shanked. This tells us the \"if\" part of our conditional statement is false.\n\nNow, think about the rain example. If it didn't rain, does that mean the ground *must* be dry? No, it could be wet for other reasons. \n\nSimilarly, just because the whiffle wasn't shanked doesn't automatically mean it didn't tink. There might be other ways for a whiffle to tink.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
