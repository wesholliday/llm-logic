It tells us that Erin taking a train is guaranteed IF Sam took a plane. It does NOT guarantee Sam took a plane if Erin took a train.\n* **Statement 2:** Erin took a train. This statement confirms the second part of our conditional statement.\n\nHowever, remember that even if the second part of a conditional statement is true, it doesn't automatically mean the first part is also true.  Erin taking a train could have happened for other reasons unrelated to Sam's mode of transportation.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
