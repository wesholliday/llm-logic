It doesn't mean Ben *did* eat pasta, just that *if* he did, then Kate definitely ate salad.\n* **Statement 2:** Kate ate salad. This tells us a fact, but it doesn't reveal anything about what Ben ate.\n\nCould Kate have eaten salad without Ben eating pasta? Yes, absolutely. The first statement only dictates what happens if Ben eats pasta; it says nothing about what happens if he doesn't. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
