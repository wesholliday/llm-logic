It doesn't mean Lisa *did* buy the red shirt, just that *if* she did, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n* **Statement 2:** Mark bought the blue shirt. This tells us a fact, but it doesn't reveal anything about Lisa's purchase.\n\nConsider this: Mark could have bought the blue shirt even if Lisa didn't buy the red shirt. Statement 1 only dictates what happens if Lisa buys the red shirt, not what happens if she doesn't.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
