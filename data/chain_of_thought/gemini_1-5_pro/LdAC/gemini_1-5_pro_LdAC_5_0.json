It doesn't mean Jeff *did* play basketball, just that *if* he did, then Amy played tennis.\n* **Statement 2:** Amy played tennis. This tells us Amy played tennis, but it doesn't tell us anything about whether Jeff played basketball.\n\nCould Amy have played tennis without Jeff playing basketball? Yes, the first statement doesn't rule that out. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
