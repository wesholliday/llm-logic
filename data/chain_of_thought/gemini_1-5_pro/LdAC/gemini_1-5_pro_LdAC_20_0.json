It doesn't tell us anything is definitively red or yellow, just that *if* the apple is red, *then* the banana must be yellow.\n* **Statement 2:** The banana was yellow. This tells us a fact about the banana, but it doesn't automatically tell us anything about the apple.\n\nCould the apple be red? Yes, it's possible.  But could the apple be another color, and the banana still be yellow? Also yes.  The statements don't link the banana's color back to the apple's color.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
