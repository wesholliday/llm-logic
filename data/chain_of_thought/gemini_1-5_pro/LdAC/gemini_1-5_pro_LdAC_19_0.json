            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Statement 1:** If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This is a conditional statement. It doesn't mean Tom *always* watches football, just that *if* he does, then Jen will watch basketball.\n* **Statement 2:** Jen watched basketball. This tells us nothing about whether Tom watched football or not.\n\nCould Jen watch basketball even if Tom didn't watch football? Yes, absolutely.  The first statement only dictates what happens if Tom *does* watch football. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
