It doesn't mean Mary WAS at the wedding, just that IF she was, then Sue was too.\n* **Statement 2:** Sue was at the wedding. This tells us Sue was definitely there. \n\nHowever, Statement 1 only links Sue's presence to Mary's presence. It doesn't work in reverse.  Just because Sue was there doesn't automatically mean Mary was. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
