It doesn't mean Sue *did* choose pizza, just that *if* she did, then Bob definitely chose pasta.\n* **Statement 2:** Bob chose pasta. This tells us a fact, but it doesn't reveal anything about Sue's choice.\n\nCould Bob have chosen pasta even if Sue didn't choose pizza? Yes, potentially.  The first statement only dictates what happens if Sue chooses pizza; it doesn't restrict Bob's choices in other situations.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
