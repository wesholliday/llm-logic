Identify the statements:**\n\n* **Statement 1 (Conditional):** If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n* **Statement 2 (Fact):** The wolf was in the den.\n\n**2. Understand conditional statements:**\n\n* Conditional statements (If P, then Q) are only false if P is true and Q is false. \n* They don't tell us anything about what happens if Q is true.\n\n**3. Apply the logic:**\n\n* We know the wolf was in the den (Q is true).\n* This fact alone doesn't tell us whether the bear was in the cave or not. The bear could have been in the cave, or somewhere else entirely.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
