Premise 2 tells us that if Mary was there, Sue must have been there too. \n* **Contradiction:** But Premise 1 tells us Sue was *not* at the wedding. This creates a contradiction.\n* **Resolution:** The only way to resolve the contradiction is to conclude that our initial assumption (that Mary was at the wedding) must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
