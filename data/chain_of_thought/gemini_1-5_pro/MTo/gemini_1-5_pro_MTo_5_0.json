It tells us that if a certain condition is met (Jeff playing basketball), then a result is guaranteed (Amy playing tennis).\n\nWe know from Premise 1 that the result (Amy playing tennis) did *not* happen.  Since the result of the conditional statement is false, the condition must also be false. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
