It tells us that if Tom watched football, then Jen MUST have watched basketball.  However, Premise 1 tells us definitively that Jen did NOT watch basketball. This directly contradicts the potential outcome stated in Premise 2. \n\nSince the outcome in Premise 2 cannot be true (Jen watching basketball), the condition in Premise 2 (Tom watching football) also CANNOT be true. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
