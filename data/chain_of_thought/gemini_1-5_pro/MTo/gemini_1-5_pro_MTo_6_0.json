It's phrased as an \"if-then\" statement.  This type of statement is only false if the first part is true and the second part is false. \n\n* We know Bob did NOT choose pasta (Premise 1). \n* That means the second part of Premise 2 is false.\n* For the entire Premise 2 to hold true, the first part MUST also be false.\n\nTherefore, Sue could not have chosen pizza.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
