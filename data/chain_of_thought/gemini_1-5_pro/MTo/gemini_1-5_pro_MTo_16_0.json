We know from Premise 1 that the \"THEN\" part of this statement (the pants were denim) is false. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the \"THEN\" part is false, the only way the entire statement can be true is if the \"IF\" part is also false.  \n\nTherefore, for Premise 2 to hold true, the shirt cannot be cotton.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
