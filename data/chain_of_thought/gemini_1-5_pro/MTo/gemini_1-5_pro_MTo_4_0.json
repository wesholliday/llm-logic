It tells us that IF the alien visited Mars, THEN the robot visited Jupiter.  \n\nWe know from Statement 1 that the robot did NOT visit Jupiter. This means the \"then\" part of Statement 2 is false. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the \"then\" part is false, the \"if\" part must also be false to make the whole statement true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
