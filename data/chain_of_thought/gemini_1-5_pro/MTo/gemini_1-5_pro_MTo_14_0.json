It tells us that if the bear IS in the cave, then the wolf MUST be in the den.  \n\nHowever, Premise 1 tells us the wolf is NOT in the den. This directly contradicts the outcome stated in Premise 2. \n\nTherefore, to make the statements consistent, the condition in Premise 2 (the bear being in the cave) cannot be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
