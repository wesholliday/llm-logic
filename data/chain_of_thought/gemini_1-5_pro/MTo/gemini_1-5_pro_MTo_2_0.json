It tells us what happens IF the griffin is in the forest.  However, Statement 1 tells us definitively that the unicorn is NOT in the forest. \n\nThis means the \"if\" part of Statement 2 cannot be true.  If the griffin WAS in the forest, then the unicorn would HAVE to be in the forest according to Statement 2. Since the unicorn is NOT in the forest, the griffin cannot be either.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
