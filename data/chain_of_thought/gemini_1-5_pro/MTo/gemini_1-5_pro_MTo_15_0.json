It tells us that if a certain condition is met (Sam taking a plane), then a consequence follows (Erin taking a train).\n\nWe know from Premise 1 that the consequence of this conditional statement (Erin taking a train) is false. \n\nSince the consequence is false, the only way for the entire conditional statement (Premise 2) to hold true is if the condition (Sam taking a plane) is also false.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
