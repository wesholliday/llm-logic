We know from Premise 1 that the truck is NOT blue.  This means the \"then\" part of our conditional statement is false. \n\nIn order for the entire conditional statement (Premise 2) to be true, if the \"then\" part is false, the \"if\" part must also be false.  \n\nTherefore, the car cannot be red.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
