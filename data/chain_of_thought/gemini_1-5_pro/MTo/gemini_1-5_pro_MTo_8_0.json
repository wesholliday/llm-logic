It tells us that if the vampire being awake is true, then the mummy being awake must also be true.  \n\nWe know from Premise 1 that the mummy was NOT awake. This directly contradicts the potential outcome stated in Premise 2. \n\nTherefore, for the entire statement of Premise 2 to be true, the first part (the vampire being awake) MUST be false.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
