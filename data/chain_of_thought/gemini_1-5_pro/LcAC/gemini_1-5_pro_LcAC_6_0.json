Premise 1 only tells us what happens if Sue chooses pizza; it doesn't restrict what happens if she doesn't.\n\n* **Logical fallacy:**  This is similar to the fallacy of affirming the consequent. Just because the second part of an \"if-then\" statement is true doesn't mean the first part must also be true.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
