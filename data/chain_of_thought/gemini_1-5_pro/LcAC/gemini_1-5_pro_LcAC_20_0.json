            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Statement 1:** If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. This is a conditional statement. It doesn't tell us anything about the actual color of the apple or banana, just that *if* the apple was red, *then* the banana must have been yellow.\n\n* **Statement 2:** The banana was yellow. This tells us the banana was indeed yellow, but it doesn't give us any information about the apple.\n\n**Reasoning:**  Even though the banana was yellow, we can't conclude the apple was red.  The original statement only tells us what happens if the apple *was* red, not what happens if the banana is yellow. There could be other reasons the banana was yellow.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
