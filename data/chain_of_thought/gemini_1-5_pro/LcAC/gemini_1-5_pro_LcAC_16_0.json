Here's why we can't be sure:\n\n* **Statement 1 only works one way.** It tells us what happens if the shirt IS cotton, but doesn't say anything about what happens if the shirt ISN'T cotton. \n* **The pants being denim could happen for other reasons.** Maybe there's a sale on denim pants, or the person just likes denim, regardless of their shirt material.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
