It doesn't mean the griffin *was* in the forest, just that *if* it was, then the unicorn was too.\n* **Statement 2:** The unicorn was in the forest. This tells us the second part of our conditional statement is true. \n\nHowever, knowing the second part of a conditional statement is true doesn't tell us if the first part is true or not. \n\n**Example:** If it's raining (statement 1), then the ground is wet (statement 2).  If we know the ground is wet, it doesn't automatically mean it's raining. There could be other reasons.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude the griffin was in the forest just because the unicorn was.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
