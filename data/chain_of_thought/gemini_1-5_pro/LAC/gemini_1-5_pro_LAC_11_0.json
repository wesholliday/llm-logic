It doesn't mean the cake *was* chocolate, just that *if* it was, *then* the muffins were blueberry.\n* **Statement 2:** The muffins were blueberry. This tells us a fact, but it doesn't reveal anything about the cake.\n\nCould the muffins be blueberry even if the cake wasn't chocolate?  Yes, absolutely.  The first statement only dictates what happens if the cake *is* chocolate. It doesn't restrict the muffins' flavor in any other situation.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
