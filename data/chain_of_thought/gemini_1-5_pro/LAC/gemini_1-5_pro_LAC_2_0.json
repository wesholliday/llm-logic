It doesn't mean the griffin WAS in the forest, just that IF it was, then the unicorn would be too.\n* **Statement 2:** The unicorn was in the forest. This tells us the unicorn was definitely there.\n\nHowever, Statement 1 only works one way.  Just because the unicorn was there doesn't automatically mean the griffin was.  The unicorn could be in the forest for other reasons.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
