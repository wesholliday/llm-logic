            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Statement 1:** If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This is a conditional statement. It doesn't mean Tom *always* watches football, just that *if* he does, then Jen will watch basketball.\n* **Statement 2:** Jen watched basketball. This tells us Jen indeed watched basketball, but it doesn't reveal anything about Tom's actions.\n\nCould Jen watch basketball even if Tom didn't watch football? Yes,  Statement 1 only dictates what happens if Tom *does* watch football. It doesn't prevent Jen from watching basketball for other reasons.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that Tom watched football.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
