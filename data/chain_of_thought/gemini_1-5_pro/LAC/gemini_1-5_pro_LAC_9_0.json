            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Statement 1:** If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This is a conditional statement. It doesn't mean Lisa actually bought the red shirt, just that *if* she did, then Mark definitely bought the blue one.\n\n* **Statement 2:** Mark bought the blue shirt. This tells us Mark did indeed buy the blue shirt.\n\n* **The Question:** Can we be certain Lisa bought the red shirt?  We know Mark buying the blue shirt is a guaranteed outcome *if* Lisa bought the red one. However, there could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt.  The original statement doesn't say Mark *only* buys the blue shirt if Lisa buys the red one.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
