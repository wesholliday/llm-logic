It doesn't mean Sue *did* choose pizza, just that *if* she did, then Bob definitely chose pasta.\n* **Statement 2:** Bob chose pasta. This tells us a fact, but doesn't directly reveal anything about Sue's choice.\n\nConsider this: Bob could choose pasta even if Sue chose something else.  The original statement only works one way. \n\n**Answer:** no \n"
