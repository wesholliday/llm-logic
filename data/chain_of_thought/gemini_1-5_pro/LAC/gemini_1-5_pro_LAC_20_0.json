It doesn't tell us anything about the actual color of the apple or banana, just that *if* the apple is red, *then* the banana must be yellow.\n* **Statement 2:** The banana was yellow. This tells us the banana's color, but doesn't directly reveal anything about the apple.\n\nWe cannot assume the apple was red just because the banana was yellow. The original statement only works one way.  The banana being yellow doesn't force the apple to be red. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
