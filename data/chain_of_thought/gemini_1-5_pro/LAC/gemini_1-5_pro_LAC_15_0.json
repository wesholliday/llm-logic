It only tells us what happens if Sam takes a plane. It doesn't guarantee that Sam actually took a plane.\n* **Statement 2:** Erin took a train. This statement confirms the second part of our conditional statement. \n\nHowever, just because the second part of a conditional statement is true, it doesn't mean the first part must also be true.  Erin taking a train doesn't force Sam to have taken a plane. There could be other reasons why Erin took a train.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
