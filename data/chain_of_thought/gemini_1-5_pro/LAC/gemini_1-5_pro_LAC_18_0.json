Here's why they don't:\n\n* **Statement 1 only tells us what happens IF the doll is plastic.** It doesn't say the truck is ONLY metal if the doll is plastic.  Maybe the truck is always metal, regardless of the doll.\n\n**Example:** Imagine the truck is always metal, and sometimes the doll is plastic, sometimes wood. Statement 1 still holds true, but the doll being plastic isn't the only reason the truck is metal.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
