It doesn't definitively say the dog WAS inside, only that IF the dog was inside, THEN the cat was outside.\n* **Statement 2:** The cat was outside. This statement confirms the second part of our conditional statement. \n\nHowever, knowing the second part of a conditional statement is true does NOT automatically mean the first part is true.  \n\n**Example:** If it's raining (conditional), then the ground is wet (result).  We can have wet ground without rain (sprinklers, someone spilled something, etc.).\n\n**Applying to our problem:** Just because the cat was outside doesn't mean the dog MUST have been inside. There could be other reasons the cat was outside.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
