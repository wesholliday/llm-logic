It doesn't mean Mary WAS at the wedding, just that IF she was, then Sue was too.\n* **Statement 2:** Sue was at the wedding. This tells us Sue was definitely there.\n\nHowever, Statement 1 only works one way.  Just because Sue was there doesn't automatically mean Mary was.  It's possible Sue goes to weddings without Mary.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
