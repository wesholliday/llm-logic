It doesn't tell us the car *was* red, only that *if* it was, *then* the truck was blue.\n* **Statement 2:** The truck was blue. This tells us a fact, but it doesn't reveal anything about the car's color.\n\nCould the truck be blue even if the car wasn't red?  Yes, there are other possibilities for why the truck might be blue. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
