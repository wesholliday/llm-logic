            "content": "Here's how we can break down the logic:\n\n* **Statement 1:** If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. This is a conditional statement. It doesn't mean the shirt *was* cotton, just that *if* it was, *then* the pants were denim.\n* **Statement 2:** The pants were denim. This tells us a fact, but it doesn't automatically reveal anything about the shirt.\n\n**Reasoning:**  Just because the pants were denim doesn't mean the shirt *had* to be cotton.  Maybe the pants are *always* denim, regardless of the shirt material. \n\n**Answer: No** \n"
