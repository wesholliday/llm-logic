Here's why they don't:\n\n* **Statement 1 only tells us what happens if Joe went to the park.** It doesn't say anything about what happens if Joe *didn't* go to the park. \n* **Lucy going to the zoo doesn't mean Joe MUST have gone to the park.** Maybe Lucy goes to the zoo all the time, regardless of Joe's park visits.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
