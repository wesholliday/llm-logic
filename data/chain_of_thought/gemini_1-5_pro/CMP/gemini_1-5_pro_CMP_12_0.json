Publishing data indicates thrillers will likely be the #1 genre this year, followed closely by romances, with mysteries far behind. These genres lead the market, so if romances aren\u2019t #1, then if thrillers aren\u2019t, mysteries will be. Moreover, thrillers likely will lead sales and hence romances likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if thrillers aren\u2019t #1, mysteries will be?",

            "content": "Step 1: **Analyze the given information:** We know thrillers, romances, and mysteries are the top-selling genres. Thrillers are projected to be #1, followed by romances, and then mysteries.\n\nStep 2: **Examine the first conditional statement:** \"If romances aren\u2019t #1, then if thrillers aren\u2019t, mysteries will be.\" This statement tells us that IF romances are not the top genre AND thrillers are also not the top genre, THEN mysteries will be the top genre.\n\nStep 3: **Examine the second statement:** \"Moreover, thrillers likely will lead sales and hence romances likely won\u2019t.\" This statement suggests that thrillers are expected to be #1, making it unlikely for romances to be #1.\n\nStep 4: **Connect the information:** While the second statement makes it seem like romances won't be #1, it doesn't provide information about what happens if thrillers AREN'T #1. The first statement only guarantees mysteries to be #1 if BOTH romances and thrillers are not #1.\n\nStep 5: **Evaluate the question:** \"Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if thrillers aren\u2019t #1, mysteries will be?\"  The information provided doesn't guarantee mysteries will be #1 just because thrillers aren't. It's possible romances could be #1 if thrillers aren't.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
