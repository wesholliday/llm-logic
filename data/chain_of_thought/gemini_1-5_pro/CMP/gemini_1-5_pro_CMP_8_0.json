    "user_prompt": "Suppose that India, China, and Russia are the world's leading emerging economies. Economists project it's likely India's economy will grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind. These are by far the biggest emerging economies, so if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn\u2019t, Russia will be. Moreover, India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if India isn\u2019t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be?",

            "content": "Let's break down the argument:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn\u2019t, Russia will be.\n* **Premise 2:** India's economy likely will grow the fastest (meaning China won't be the fastest).\n* **Conclusion:** Therefore, if India isn\u2019t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be.\n\nThe argument seems to hinge on the idea that if India isn't the fastest growing, then the only other option is Russia. However, the premises only state what happens if China *isn't* the fastest growing.  They don't say anything about what happens if India *is* the fastest growing, but then for some reason doesn't end up being the top-growing emerging economy. There could be other factors at play, or other emerging economies not mentioned.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
