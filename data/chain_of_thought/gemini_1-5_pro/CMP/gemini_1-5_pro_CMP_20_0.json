    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",

Make sure not to answer with 'Answer:' until *after* you think step by step and explain your reasoning.",

Since we're told coffee likely WILL retain the most drinkers, we don't even need to consider the scenario where it doesn't. Premise 1, which sets up that scenario, becomes irrelevant.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
