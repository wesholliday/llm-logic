    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Premise 1:** Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth.\n* **Premise 2:** Economists believe Tennessee will likely add the most jobs, followed by Georgia, then Missouri.\n* **Premise 3:** If Georgia doesn't add the most jobs, and Tennessee doesn't either, then Missouri will.\n* **Premise 4:** Tennessee is likely to add the most jobs, so Georgia likely won't.\n\nWe're asked to determine if the following conclusion is likely:\n\n* **Conclusion:** If Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will.\n\nLet's analyze:\n\nPremise 4 suggests that it's unlikely Georgia will add the most jobs. However, this doesn't automatically mean Missouri will take the lead if Tennessee falters.  Premise 3 states that Missouri will only add the most jobs if BOTH Georgia AND Tennessee fall behind. \n\nTherefore, just because Tennessee might not add the most jobs, it doesn't necessarily mean Missouri will. It's possible Georgia could still outperform Missouri even if Tennessee falls to second place.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
