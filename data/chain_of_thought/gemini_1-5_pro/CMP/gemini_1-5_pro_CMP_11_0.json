    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Ford, Toyota, and Honda lead US auto sales. Industry analysis expects Ford will sell the most vehicles this year, followed closely by Toyota, with Honda lagging significantly behind. These brands lead the market, so if Toyota isn\u2019t #1 in sales, then if Ford isn\u2019t, Honda will be. Moreover, Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Ford doesn\u2019t lead in sales, Honda will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the statements and the logic:\n\n* **Statement 1:** Ford, Toyota, and Honda are the top 3 sellers in the US.\n* **Statement 2:** Ford is projected to be #1, Toyota #2, and Honda a distant #3.\n* **Statement 3:**  Since the top 3 dominate, if Toyota isn't #1 and Ford isn't #1, then Honda must be #1.\n* **Statement 4:** Ford is likely to be #1, so Toyota is likely not #1.\n* **Question:** Does it follow that if Ford ISN'T #1, Honda will likely be?\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* We're trying to determine if Ford NOT being #1 makes it likely Honda will be #1.\n* Statement 3 tells us that IF neither Ford nor Toyota is #1, THEN Honda is #1. This is a crucial piece of information.\n* However, Statement 4 says Ford is LIKELY to be #1.  While not certain, this makes the scenario where Ford ISN'T #1 less probable.\n* Since the scenario where Ford isn't #1 is less probable, the conclusion that Honda would then be #1 is also less probable. \n\n**Answer: No** \n"
