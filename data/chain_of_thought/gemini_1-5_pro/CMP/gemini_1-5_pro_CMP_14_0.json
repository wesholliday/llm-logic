    "user_prompt": "Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?",

We know that only one law can pass. If MW doesn't pass, it's down to PFL or SLF.  We're told PFL is unlikely if MW is likely. However, we are evaluating the scenario *given* that MW *doesn't* happen. This makes the information about the relationship between MW and PFL irrelevant.\n\nWithout information about the likelihood of PFL *given* that MW doesn't happen, we can't definitively say whether SLF is likely.  It's possible, but not necessarily likely.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
