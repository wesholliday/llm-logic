    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians are the leading political parties. Based on recent polling, the Democrats likely will gain the most new voters, followed by Republicans, with Libertarians trailing distantly. These are the only major parties, so if Republicans don\u2019t gain the most voters, then if Democrats don\u2019t, Libertarians will. Moreover, Democrats likely will gain the most voters and hence Republicans likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will?",

This is true because there are only three parties.\n* **Statement 2:** Democrats likely will gain the most voters, so Republicans likely won't. This is a reasonable inference.\n\n**The Question:** Does it follow that if Democrats *don't* gain the most voters, Libertarians will?\n\n**Reasoning:**  While Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 suggests that the scenario where Democrats *don't* gain the most voters is unlikely.  The question hinges on an unlikely event.  Even though Statement 1 guarantees Libertarians would win if both Democrats and Republicans lose, the likelihood of that scenario is low based on the information given.\n\n**Answer: No** \n"
