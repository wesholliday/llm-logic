    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options in a city. According to ridership data, Uber likely will have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. These are the only major transportation providers, so if Lyft doesn\u2019t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. Moreover, Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won\u2019t give the most rides. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information provided:\n\n* **Fact 1:** Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the only major transportation options.\n* **Fact 2:** Uber is predicted to have the most rides, followed by Lyft, then taxis.\n* **Claim 1:** If Lyft doesn't have the most rides, and Uber doesn't have the most rides, then taxis must have the most rides. This is a true statement because there are only three options.\n* **Claim 2:** Uber is likely to have the most rides, so Lyft likely won't. This is a reasonable inference.\n\n**The Question:** Does it follow that if Uber *doesn't* have the most rides, taxis likely will?\n\n**Reasoning:**  Claim 2 suggests Uber is likely to have the most rides. The question asks us to consider the scenario where this likely event *doesn't* happen. If Uber doesn't have the most rides, Claim 1 tells us taxis would only have the most if Lyft also doesn't.  We don't have enough information to determine the likelihood of Lyft having the most rides in this scenario.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
