    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, and Beyonce have the top-selling albums this year. Industry experts project it's likely Taylor Swift's album will sell the most copies, followed closely by Bad Bunny's, with Beyonce's album far behind. These are the only top-sellers, so if Bad Bunny\u2019s album doesn\u2019t sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift\u2019s doesn\u2019t, Beyonce\u2019s will. Moreover, Taylor Swift\u2019s likely will sell the most and hence Bad Bunny's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will?",

            "content": "Okay, let's break this down:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If Bad Bunny's album doesn't sell the most, and Taylor Swift's doesn't either, then Beyonce's will. This makes sense because they are the only three contenders.\n* **Premise 2:** Taylor Swift's album is likely to sell the most.\n* **Premise 3:**  Because Taylor Swift is likely to sell the most, Bad Bunny is unlikely to. \n\n**The Question:** Does it follow that if Taylor Swift DOESN'T sell the most, Beyonce likely will?\n\n**Reasoning:** Premise 2 says Taylor Swift is *likely* to sell the most, not that she definitely will.  So, there's a possibility she won't. If that happens, Premise 1 tells us Beyonce's album will be the top seller. \n\n**Answer: Yes** \n"
