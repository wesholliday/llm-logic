It only tells us what happens IF Lisa buys the red shirt. \n* **Consider Premise 1:**  We know Lisa DID NOT buy the red shirt.  \n\nSince the condition in Premise 2 (Lisa buying the red shirt) is not met, we have no information about whether Mark bought the blue shirt. He might have, he might not have. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
