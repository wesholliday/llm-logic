It only tells us something if the first part (Mary being at the wedding) is true. Since Premise 1 tells us Mary was *not* at the wedding, Premise 2 doesn't actually give us any information about Sue. \n\nWe cannot logically connect Mary's absence to a conclusion about Sue's presence.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
