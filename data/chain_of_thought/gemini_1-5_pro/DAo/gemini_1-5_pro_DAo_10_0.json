It only tells us something if the \"if\" part is true. \n* **Is the \"if\" part of Premise 2 true?** No, Premise 1 tells us the dog was NOT inside.\n* **Since the \"if\" part of Premise 2 is false:** We can't conclude anything about the cat being outside or inside. Premise 2 only applies if the dog was inside.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
