It only tells us something about the truck IF the doll is plastic. \n* **But Statement 1 tells us:** The doll IS NOT plastic.  \n\nSince the condition in Statement 2 (the doll being plastic) is not met, we can't draw any conclusions about the truck's material from these statements. The truck could be metal, or it could be made of something else entirely.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
