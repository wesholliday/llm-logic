It only tells us something if Alex *did* finish the race. \n* **Consider Premise 1:**  We know Alex *did not* finish the race. Therefore, Premise 2 doesn't give us any useful information about whether Chris finished.\n\nSince Premise 2 is irrelevant given Premise 1, we have no information about Chris finishing the race.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
