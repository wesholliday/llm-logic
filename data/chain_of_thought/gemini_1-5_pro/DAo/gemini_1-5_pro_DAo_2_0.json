However, Premise 1 tells us the griffin is *not* in the forest.  Therefore, Premise 2 doesn't actually tell us anything about the unicorn's whereabouts. \n\nIt's possible the unicorn was in the forest for other reasons, or not in the forest at all.  We can't logically connect the premises to the conclusion.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
