This doesn't tell us anything definitive about whether Chris *did* finish. \n* **Now look at Premise 1:** It only creates an implication if Alex finished.  If Alex *didn't* finish, Chris finishing or not finishing has no bearing on the truth of Premise 1.\n* **Therefore:**  We could have a situation where Alex didn't finish, and Chris might or might not have finished. This wouldn't contradict either premise.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
