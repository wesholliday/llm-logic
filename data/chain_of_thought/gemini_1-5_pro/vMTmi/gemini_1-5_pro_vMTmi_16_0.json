Consider this scenario:\n\n* The shirt is cotton.\n* The pants are corduroy.\n\nThis scenario makes both premises true:\n\n* **Premise 1 is true:**  Even though the shirt is cotton, the \"then\" part (pants must be denim) doesn't have to be true for the whole statement to be true.\n* **Premise 2 is true:** The pants are indeed not denim.\n\nHowever, the conclusion (\"The shirt was not cotton\") is false in this scenario.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
