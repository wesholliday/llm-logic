We can represent this as: F \u2192 B\n* **Premise 2:** Jen might not have watched basketball (B). This means it's possible that B is false.\n* **Conclusion:** Tom did not watch football (F). This means the conclusion is claiming F is false.\n\nNow let's consider if the premises could be true while the conclusion is false.  If Tom DID watch football (F is true), but Jen did NOT watch basketball (B is false), then:\n\n* Premise 1 (F \u2192 B) would be false (because F is true and B is false).\n* Premise 2 (B might be false) would be true.\n\nIn this scenario, the premises could be true while the conclusion is false.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
