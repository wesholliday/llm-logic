Premise 1 only states what happens IF Lisa bought the red shirt. It doesn't say anything about what happens if she didn't.\n* **Could the conclusion be false even if the premises are true?** Yes.  It's possible Mark didn't buy the blue shirt for some other reason, and Lisa still could have bought the red shirt.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
