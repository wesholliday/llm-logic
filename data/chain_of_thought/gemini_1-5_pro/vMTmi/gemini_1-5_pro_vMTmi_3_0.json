It does *not* say that only James writes mystery novels. \n\n2. **Now the second premise:**  It introduces the possibility that the book is NOT a mystery. This doesn't automatically tell us anything about the author.\n\n3. **Crucially:**  The book could be non-mystery and written by someone else entirely. The premises don't exclude this.  Therefore, we can't definitively conclude James *didn't* write it.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
