This doesn't mean the doll MUST be plastic, just that IF it were, the truck would be metal.\n\n2. **The second premise introduces doubt:** It states the truck MIGHT NOT have been metal. This directly challenges the THEN part of our first premise.\n\n3. **Because the second premise weakens the conditional statement in the first premise, it's possible for the doll to NOT be plastic, even if the truck wasn't metal.**  There could be other scenarios at play.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
