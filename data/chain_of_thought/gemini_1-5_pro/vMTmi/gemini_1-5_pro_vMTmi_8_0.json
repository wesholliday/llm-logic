(If V, then M)\n* **Premise 2:** The mummy might not have been awake. (It's possible that not M)\n* **Conclusion:** The vampire was not awake. (Not V)\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nWe need to see if it's possible for the premises to be true while the conclusion is false. \n\n* **Consider this scenario:** The mummy was asleep (not M). This satisfies Premise 2.  Premise 1 doesn't say anything about what happens if the mummy is asleep. It only tells us what happens if the vampire is awake. So, even if the mummy is asleep, the vampire could still be asleep OR awake. \n* **Therefore:**  The premises can be true, and the conclusion false.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
