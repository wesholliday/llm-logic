(If A, then B)\n* **Premise 2:** The robot might not have visited Jupiter. (Maybe not B)\n* **Conclusion:** The alien did not visit Mars. (Not A)\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf the robot definitely did *not* visit Jupiter, then we could definitively say the alien didn't visit Mars (because Premise 1 links those two events).  However, Premise 2 only tells us it's *possible* the robot didn't visit Jupiter. This leaves open the possibility that the robot *did* visit Jupiter, which would mean the alien *could* have visited Mars. \n\nSince the premises don't definitively rule out the possibility of the alien visiting Mars, the argument is not logically valid.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
