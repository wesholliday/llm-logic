(This sets up a conditional relationship)\n* **Premise 2:** The muffins might not have been blueberry. (This introduces uncertainty about the second part of the conditional statement)\n* **Conclusion:** The cake was not chocolate.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf the muffins were definitely NOT blueberry, then we could definitively say the cake wasn't chocolate (based on Premise 1). However, Premise 2 only says the muffins *might* not have been blueberry. This leaves open the possibility that they WERE blueberry. \n\nIf the muffins WERE blueberry, it doesn't tell us anything definitive about the cake. The cake could still be chocolate or something else.\n\n**Answer: No** \n"
