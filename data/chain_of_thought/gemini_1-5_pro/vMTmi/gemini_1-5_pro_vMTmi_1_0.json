This doesn't automatically mean Mary wasn't there. \n* **Premise 1 only works one way:** Premise 1 doesn't say that if Sue was NOT at the wedding, then Mary wasn't. It only works in one direction.\n* **Example:**  Maybe Mary went to the wedding, but Sue had a last-minute emergency and couldn't make it. This scenario would fit both premises but contradict the conclusion.\n\n**Therefore, the argument is not logically valid because the premises could be true, and the conclusion could still be false.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
