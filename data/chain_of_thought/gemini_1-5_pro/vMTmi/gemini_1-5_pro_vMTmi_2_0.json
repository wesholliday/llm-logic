This doesn't automatically mean the griffin wasn't there. \n* **Premise 1 only works one way:** Premise 1 only states that IF the griffin was there, THEN the unicorn must have been. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the unicorn wasn't there. The griffin could still have been in the forest even if the unicorn wasn't.\n\n**Therefore:** The conclusion doesn't logically follow from the premises.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
