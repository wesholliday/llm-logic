It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if Erin takes a train.  Erin might take a train for other reasons completely unrelated to Sam's mode of transportation.\n\n* **Inference we're testing:** If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane. This is trying to reverse the original statement's logic. \n\n* **Example:** Imagine Sam takes a car. The original statement doesn't say anything about what happens if Sam takes a car.  Erin might still take a train even though Sam didn't take a plane. This shows that just because Erin took a train, it doesn't mean Sam must have taken a plane.\n\n**Answer: No** \n"
