This means the presence of the griffin implies the presence of the unicorn. \n\n* **Question:** Does the presence of the unicorn imply the presence of the griffin?\n\n* **Reasoning:**  Just because the unicorn is in the forest, it doesn't automatically mean the griffin is there. The original statement doesn't say the unicorn can't be in the forest without the griffin.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
