This is a conditional statement where \"the bear was in the case\" is the hypothesis and \"the wolf was in the den\" is the conclusion.\n\n* **Inference we're testing:** If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case. This flips the hypothesis and conclusion from the original statement.\n\n* **Logical reasoning:**  Just because the wolf is in the den doesn't automatically mean the bear is in the case. There could be other reasons the wolf is in the den. \n\n**Answer:** no \n"
