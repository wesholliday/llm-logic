It tells us that Mark buying the blue shirt depends on Lisa buying the red shirt.\n\n* **Question:** Can we infer \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt\"? This is asking if we can simply reverse the original statement and have it still be true.\n\n* **Reasoning:**  Just because Mark bought the blue shirt doesn't mean Lisa MUST have bought the red shirt. There could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt. Maybe he just liked it!\n\nAnswer: no \n"
