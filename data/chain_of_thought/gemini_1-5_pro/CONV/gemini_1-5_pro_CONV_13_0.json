It tells us that *if* a certain condition is met (car being red), *then* a consequence follows (truck being blue).\n\n* **Inference we're testing:** If the truck was blue, then the car was red. This flips the original statement. It's suggesting that the consequence (truck being blue) guarantees the condition (car being red).\n\n* **Logical fallacy:**  Just because the truck is blue doesn't mean the car *must* be red. There could be other reasons for the truck being blue. \n\n**Answer:** no \n"
