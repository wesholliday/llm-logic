            "content": "Let's break this down:\n\n* **Original statement:** If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This means that Tom watching football is a potential cause for Jen watching basketball. \n\n* **Question:** Can we infer \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football\"? This is asking if Jen watching basketball means Tom MUST have watched football.\n\n* **Reasoning:**  Just because Jen watched basketball, it doesn't mean Tom necessarily watched football.  Maybe Jen likes basketball and watches it regardless of Tom's viewing choices. The original statement only tells us what happens if Tom watches football, not the other way around.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
