This is a conditional statement where:\n    * **Hypothesis:** The alien visited Mars.\n    * **Conclusion:** The robot visited Jupiter.\n\n* **Inference we're checking:** If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars. This flips the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement.\n\n* **Logical reasoning:**  Just because the robot visited Jupiter doesn't automatically mean the alien visited Mars. There could be other reasons the robot went to Jupiter. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
