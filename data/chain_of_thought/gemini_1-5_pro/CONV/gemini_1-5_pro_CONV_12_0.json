We can represent this as P -> Z \n* **Question:** Does Lucy going to the zoo (Z) mean Joe went to the park (P)? Is Z -> P true based on the original statement?\n\nConsider these possibilities:\n\n* **Scenario 1:** Joe went to the park, and Lucy went to the zoo. This fits the original statement.\n* **Scenario 2:** Joe didn't go to the park, but Lucy still went to the zoo. The original statement doesn't say Lucy *only* goes to the zoo if Joe goes to the park. \n\n**Reasoning:** The original statement only tells us what happens if Joe goes to the park. It doesn't guarantee anything about what happens if Lucy goes to the zoo. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
