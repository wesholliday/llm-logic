It tells us that a red apple guarantees a yellow banana. \n* **Question:** Can we flip the statement and keep the meaning? In other words, does a yellow banana guarantee a red apple?\n\nNot necessarily. The original statement doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the banana is yellow.  Maybe all bananas are yellow, regardless of the apple's color.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
