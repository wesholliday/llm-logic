This means the vampire waking up is a potential cause for the mummy waking up. \n\n* **Question:** Can we say that if the mummy was awake, the vampire was *definitely* awake?\n\n* **Reasoning:**  Just because the mummy is awake doesn't mean the vampire caused it. The mummy could be awake for other reasons unrelated to the vampire. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
