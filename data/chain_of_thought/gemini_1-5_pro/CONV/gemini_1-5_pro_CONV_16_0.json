            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. This is a conditional statement where \"shirt was cotton\" is the hypothesis and \"pants were denim\" is the conclusion.\n\n* **Inference we're testing:** If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton. This flips the hypothesis and conclusion from the original statement.\n\n* **Logical fallacy:**  This is an example of the fallacy of affirming the consequent. Just because the conclusion of a conditional statement is true, it doesn't mean the hypothesis must also be true.  \n\n**Example:** The original statement could be true even if there are situations where the pants are denim, but the shirt is linen. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
