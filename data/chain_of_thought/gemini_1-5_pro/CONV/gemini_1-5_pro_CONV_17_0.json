This means that Kate eating salad is a necessary consequence of Ben eating pasta. \n\n* **Question:** Can we infer \"If Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta\"? This is asking if Ben eating pasta is a necessary consequence of Kate eating salad.\n\n* **Reasoning:** Just because Kate eats salad doesn't mean Ben *had* to have eaten pasta.  Maybe Kate eats salad all the time, regardless of Ben's food choices. The original statement only tells us what happens when Ben eats pasta, not the other way around.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
