This tells us that Sue's presence at the wedding is dependent on Mary's presence. If Mary's there, Sue's there. \n* **Question:** Can we infer \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding?\" This is asking if Mary's presence is dependent on Sue's. \n\nConsider this:  Maybe Sue always goes to weddings, even if Mary doesn't. The original statement doesn't say Sue is ONLY at the wedding if Mary is.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
