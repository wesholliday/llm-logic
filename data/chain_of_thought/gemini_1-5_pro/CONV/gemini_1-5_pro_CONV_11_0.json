This is a conditional statement, where \"the cake was chocolate\" is the hypothesis and \"the muffins were blueberry\" is the conclusion.\n\n* **Inference we're testing:** If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate. This flips the hypothesis and conclusion from the original statement.\n\n* **Logical fallacy:**  Just because the original statement might be true, it doesn't mean the reverse is also true.  For example, maybe the muffins are *always* blueberry, regardless of the cake flavor.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
