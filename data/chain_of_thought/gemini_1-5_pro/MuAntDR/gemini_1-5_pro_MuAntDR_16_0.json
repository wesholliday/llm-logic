This means there are two possibilities: it was cleaned daily, or it was cleaned upon request.  It does not have to be true that the room was cleaned upon request, as it could have been cleaned daily instead. Therefore, we cannot infer that the room must have been cleaned upon request.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
