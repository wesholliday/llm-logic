This means one of these two things MUST be true.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the shank must be nugged. This tells us that 'the shank must be nugged' is FALSE.\n\nSince one of the two options in Premise 1 MUST be true, and we know 'the shank must be nugged' is false, then the only remaining possibility is that 'the shank is plooked' must be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
