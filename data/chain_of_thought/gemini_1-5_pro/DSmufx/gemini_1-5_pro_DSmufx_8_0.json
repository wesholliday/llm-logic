This means one of these two options MUST be true.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled. This eliminates one of the options from Premise 1.\n\nSince one option MUST be true, and we've eliminated one option, the remaining option must be the true one.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
