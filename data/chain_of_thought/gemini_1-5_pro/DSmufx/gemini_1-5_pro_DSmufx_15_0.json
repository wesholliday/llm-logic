This means one of these two things MUST be true.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the dreb must be spened. This tells us the first option in Premise 1 is FALSE.\n\nSince one of the options in Premise 1 MUST be true, and we know the first option is false, the second option MUST be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
