This means at least one of the following must be true: the twonk is varnished, or the twonk is plinked.\n* **Statement 2:** It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked. This tells us that the twonk being plinked is not a necessity. \n\nNow, consider this:\n\n* If the twonk doesn't *have* to be plinked (from statement 2), but statement 1 says it has to be either varnished OR plinked, then the only remaining possibility is that the twonk must be varnished.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
