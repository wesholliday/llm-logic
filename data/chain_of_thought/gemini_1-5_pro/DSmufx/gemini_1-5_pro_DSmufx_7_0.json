This means one of the two options MUST be true, maybe even both.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked. This tells us that the whiffle being tinked is NOT a necessity. \n\nSince the whiffle doesn't HAVE to be tinked (from Premise 2) and we know one of the options in Premise 1 MUST be true, the only remaining possibility is that the whiffle is shanked.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
