This means one of these two things MUST be true.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the flob must be movated. This eliminates the first option from Premise 1. \n\nSince the first option is ruled out, and one of the options MUST be true, we are left with only the second option.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
