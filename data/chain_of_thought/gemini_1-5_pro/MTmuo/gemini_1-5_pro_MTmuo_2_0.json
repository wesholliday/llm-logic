This means the unicorn might not have been in the forest. \n* **Statement 2:** If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest. This is a conditional statement.\n\nNow let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The griffin was not in the forest\"?\n\n* **Reasoning:**  If the griffin WAS in the forest, then according to Statement 2, the unicorn MUST have been in the forest. However, Statement 1 tells us the unicorn might NOT have been in the forest. This creates a contradiction. The only way to resolve this is if our initial assumption (that the griffin was in the forest) is wrong.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
