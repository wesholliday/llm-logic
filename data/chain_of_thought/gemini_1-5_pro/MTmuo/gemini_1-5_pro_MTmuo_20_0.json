This means the banana could have been yellow, or it could have been another color. \n* **Premise 2:** If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. This sets up a conditional relationship.\n* **Conclusion we're examining:** The apple was not red.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf the apple *were* red, then according to Premise 2, the banana *must* have been yellow. However, Premise 1 tells us that the banana did *not* have to be yellow. This creates a contradiction.  The only way to resolve this contradiction is if the apple was not, in fact, red.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
