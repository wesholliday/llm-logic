This means the book could be a mystery, or it could be something else entirely. \n* **Premise 2:** If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel. This tells us something specific about books written by James.\n\nNow let's consider the conclusion:\n\n* **Conclusion:** The book was not written by James.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf the book *were* written by James, then according to Premise 2, it would have to be a mystery novel. However, Premise 1 tells us the book doesn't *have* to be a mystery novel.  This means it's possible for the book to not be a mystery novel even if James wrote it.  Therefore, we can't definitively say James didn't write the book.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
