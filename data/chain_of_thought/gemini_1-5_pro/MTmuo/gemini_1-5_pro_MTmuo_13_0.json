This means the truck could have been any color, including blue, but it wasn't necessarily blue.\n\n* **Premise 2:** If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. This sets up a conditional relationship between the car's color and the truck's color.\n\n* **Reasoning:**  We're asked if we can infer \"The car was not red.\"  Let's consider what happens if the car *was* red. Premise 2 would force the truck to be blue. However, Premise 1 tells us the truck doesn't *have* to be blue. This creates a contradiction if the car was red.\n\n* **Conclusion:** To avoid the contradiction, the car cannot be red.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
