This means the pants could have been denim, or they could have been another material. \n* **Premise 2:** If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. This sets up a conditional relationship.\n* **Conclusion:** The shirt was not cotton.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nWe need to see if the premises force the conclusion to be true. If the shirt *were* cotton, then Premise 2 would require the pants to be denim. However, Premise 1 tells us the pants don't *have* to be denim. This creates a contradiction if the shirt is cotton. \n\nTo avoid the contradiction, the shirt cannot be cotton.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
