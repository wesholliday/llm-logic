This means it's possible Sue was NOT at the wedding.\n* **Premise 2:** If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. \n* **Conclusion:** Mary was not at the wedding.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf Mary WAS at the wedding (contradicting our desired conclusion), then according to Premise 2, Sue MUST have been there too.  However, Premise 1 tells us it's possible Sue was NOT at the wedding. This creates a contradiction if we assume Mary was at the wedding.\n\nTo avoid the contradiction, the only option is that Mary was NOT at the wedding.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
