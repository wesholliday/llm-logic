This means it's possible Mark didn't buy the blue shirt.\n* **Premise 2:** If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. \n* **Conclusion:** Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf Lisa DID buy the red shirt, then according to Premise 2, Mark MUST have bought the blue shirt.  However, Premise 1 tells us it's NOT necessarily true that Mark bought the blue shirt. This creates a contradiction.  The only way to resolve this is if our initial assumption (that Lisa bought the red shirt) is false.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
