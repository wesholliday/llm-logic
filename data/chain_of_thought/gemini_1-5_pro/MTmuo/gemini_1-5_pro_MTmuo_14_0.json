This means the wolf might not have been in the den.\n* **Premise 2:** If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. This sets up a conditional relationship.\n* **Conclusion:** The bear was not in the cave.\n\nNow let's consider the relationship between the premises and the conclusion:\n\n* **If Premise 2 is true,** and the bear WAS in the cave, then the wolf MUST have been in the den. \n* **However, Premise 1 tells us** that the wolf might NOT have been in the den. \n* **This creates a contradiction if we assume the bear was in the cave.**\n\nTherefore, to avoid the contradiction, the bear couldn't have been in the cave.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
