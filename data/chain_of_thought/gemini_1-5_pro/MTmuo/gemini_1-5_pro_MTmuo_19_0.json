This means it's possible Jen did NOT watch basketball.\n\n* **Premise 2:** If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This sets up a conditional relationship.\n\n* **Conclusion:** Tom did not watch football.  We need to see if this MUST be true.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf Tom DID watch football, then Premise 2 would force Jen to have watched basketball.  But, Premise 1 says Jen didn't necessarily watch basketball. This creates a contradiction IF Tom watched football.\n\nTo avoid the contradiction, the only option left is that Tom did NOT watch football.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
