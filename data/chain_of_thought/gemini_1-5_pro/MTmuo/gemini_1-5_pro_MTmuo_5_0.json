This means it's possible Amy didn't play tennis.\n\n* **Premise 2:** If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. \n\n* **Conclusion:** Jeff did not play basketball.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf Jeff *did* play basketball, then according to Premise 2, Amy *must* have played tennis.  However, Premise 1 tells us it's *possible* Amy *didn't* play tennis.  These two statements contradict each other if we assume Jeff played basketball. \n\nTo avoid a contradiction, we must conclude that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
