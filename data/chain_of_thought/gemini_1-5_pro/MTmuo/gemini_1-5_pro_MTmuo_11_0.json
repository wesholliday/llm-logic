This means the muffins could have been blueberry, or they could have been another flavor. \n* **Premise 2:** If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry. This sets up a conditional relationship.\n* **Conclusion:** The cake was not chocolate.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf the cake *were* chocolate, then according to Premise 2, the muffins *must* have been blueberry. However, Premise 1 tells us it's *not* necessarily true that the muffins were blueberry. This creates a contradiction.  The only way to resolve this is if the initial condition (the cake being chocolate) is false.\n\n**Answer: Yes** \n"
