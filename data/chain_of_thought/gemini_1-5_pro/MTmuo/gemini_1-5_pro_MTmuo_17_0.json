This means it's possible Kate didn't eat salad.\n* **Premise 2:** If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. \n* **Conclusion:** Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nLet's consider if the conclusion MUST be true:\n\n* **Scenario:** Imagine Kate ate a sandwich (not salad). Premise 1 is satisfied.\n* In this scenario, Ben could have eaten anything (pasta, pizza, etc.) and it wouldn't contradict our information. Premise 2 only matters if Kate DID eat salad.\n\nSince we can find a scenario where the premises hold true, but the conclusion doesn't have to be true, the inference is not valid.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
