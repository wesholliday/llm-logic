We don't know for sure.\n\n* **Statement 2:** If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\n\nNow let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The dog was not inside\"?\n\n* **Reasoning:** If the dog *was* inside, then according to Statement 2, the cat *must* have been outside.  But Statement 1 tells us that's not necessarily true (the cat might have been inside). This creates a contradiction. \n\n* **To avoid the contradiction:** The dog couldn't have been inside.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
