This means the truck could have been made of something else besides metal. \n\n* **Premise 2:** If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. This sets up a conditional relationship.\n\n* **Conclusion:** The doll was not plastic.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nWe need to see if the premises force the conclusion to be true. If the doll WAS plastic (contrary to the conclusion), then Premise 2 would force the truck to be metal.  But Premise 1 tells us the truck doesn't HAVE to be metal. This creates a contradiction if we assume the doll was plastic. \n\nTherefore, to avoid a contradiction, the doll couldn't have been plastic.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
