This means the robot might or might not have visited Jupiter. \n* **Statement 2:** If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter. This sets up a conditional relationship.\n* **Goal:** Can we infer \"The alien did not visit Mars\"?\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf the alien DID visit Mars, then according to Statement 2, the robot MUST have visited Jupiter.  However, Statement 1 tells us the robot visiting Jupiter is not a certainty. This creates a contradiction.  The only way to resolve this is if our initial assumption (that the alien visited Mars) is false.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
