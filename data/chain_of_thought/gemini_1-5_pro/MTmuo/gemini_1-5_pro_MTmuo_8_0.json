This means the mummy could have been asleep. \n\n* **Statement 2:** If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. This tells us the vampire being awake guarantees the mummy is also awake.\n\n* **Goal:** We want to see if we can conclude \"The vampire was not awake.\"\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf the vampire WAS awake, statement 2 tells us the mummy MUST also be awake. However, statement 1 says the mummy doesn't HAVE to be awake. This creates a contradiction if the vampire was awake. \n\nTo avoid the contradiction, the vampire couldn't have been awake.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
