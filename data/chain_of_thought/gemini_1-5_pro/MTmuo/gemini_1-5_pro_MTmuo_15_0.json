This means it's possible Erin didn't take a train.\n* **Premise 2:** If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. \n* **Conclusion we're examining:** Sam did not take a plane.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf Sam DID take a plane, then according to Premise 2, Erin MUST have taken a train.  However, Premise 1 tells us it's NOT certain that Erin took a train. This creates a contradiction if we assume Sam took a plane. \n\nTo avoid the contradiction, the only possibility left is that Sam did NOT take a plane.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
