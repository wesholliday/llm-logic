This means it's possible Bob chose something other than pasta.\n\n* **Statement 2:** If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. This sets up a conditional relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice.\n\nNow let's consider the question: Can we infer \"Sue did not choose pizza\"?\n\n* **Reasoning:** If Sue DID choose pizza, then according to Statement 2, Bob MUST have chosen pasta. However, Statement 1 tells us that it's NOT the case that Bob MUST have chosen pasta. This creates a contradiction. \n\n* **To avoid the contradiction:** The only possibility is that Sue did NOT choose pizza. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
