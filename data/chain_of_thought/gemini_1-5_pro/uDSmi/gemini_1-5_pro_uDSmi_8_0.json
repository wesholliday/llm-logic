This presents two possibilities, but only one can be true.\n* **Statement 2:** The remote control might not be hiding under the couch. This introduces uncertainty about the second possibility from Statement 1. \n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf the remote is NOT under the couch (as Statement 2 suggests it might not be), then the only remaining possibility from Statement 1 is that it MUST be on the coffee table.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
