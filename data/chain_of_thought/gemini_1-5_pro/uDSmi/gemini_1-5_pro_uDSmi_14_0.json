This means there are only two possibilities.\n* **Statement 2:** The milk might not be chilling in the fridge. This introduces uncertainty about one of the possibilities.\n\nSince the milk might NOT be in the fridge (statement 2), and there are only two possibilities (statement 1), we can logically conclude that the milk must be on the counter. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
