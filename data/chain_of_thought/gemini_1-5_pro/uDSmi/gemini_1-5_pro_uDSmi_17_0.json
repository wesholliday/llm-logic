This means there are only two possibilities.\n* **Statement 2:** The scarf MIGHT NOT be on the coat rack. This introduces uncertainty about the second possibility.\n\nSince the scarf might not be on the coat rack (statement 2), and the only other possibility is that it's in the backpack (statement 1), we can infer that it must be in the backpack.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
