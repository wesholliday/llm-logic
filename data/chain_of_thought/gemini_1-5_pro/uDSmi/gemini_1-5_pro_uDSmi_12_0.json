This means these are the only two possibilities.\n* **Statement 2:** The jacket might not be hanging in the closet. This introduces uncertainty about the second possibility.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nSince the jacket might NOT be in the closet (statement 2), and those were the only two options (statement 1), we can conclude that it must be on the chair. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
