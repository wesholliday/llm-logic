This means these are the only two possibilities.\n* **Statement 2:** Also, the book might not be resting on the table. This introduces uncertainty about the book being on the table.\n\nSince the book must be on either the table or the shelf (from statement 1), and it might *not* be on the table (from statement 2), we can logically conclude that it must be on the shelf. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
