This means there are only two possibilities.\n* **Statement 2:** The newspaper might not be sitting on the porch. This introduces uncertainty about the second possibility.\n\nSince the second statement casts doubt on the newspaper being on the porch, and Statement 1 says it must be in one of the two places, we can logically conclude that it must be in the other location.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
