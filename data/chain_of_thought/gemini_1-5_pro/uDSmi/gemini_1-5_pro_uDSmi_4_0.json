This means these are the only two possibilities.\n* **Statement 2:** The cat might not be playing in the bedroom. This introduces uncertainty about the second possibility.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nWhile the first statement makes it seem like the cat *must* be in one of those two locations, the second statement weakens that certainty.  Just because the cat *might not* be in the bedroom doesn't automatically mean it *is* on the couch. There could be other places the cat could be.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
