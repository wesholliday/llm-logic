This presents two possibilities, but it doesn't confirm either one is true.\n* **Statement 2:** Also, the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet. This introduces doubt about one of the possibilities from Statement 1. \n\nSince we're unsure if the keys are dangling in the cabinet, we can't definitively say the only other option (keys in the drawer) is true. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
