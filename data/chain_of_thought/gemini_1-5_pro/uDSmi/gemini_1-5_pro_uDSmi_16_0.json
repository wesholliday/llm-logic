This presents two possibilities, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that the pen could be in both places. \n* **Statement 2:** Also, the pen might not be on my desk. This introduces uncertainty about the pen's presence on the desk but doesn't confirm its location in the bag.\n\nEven though the pen might not be on the desk, it doesn't automatically mean it's in the bag. It could be elsewhere entirely.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
