This means there are only two possibilities.\n* **Statement 2:** The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand. This introduces uncertainty to the second possibility.\n\nSince the second possibility might not be true, and we know one of the two possibilities MUST be true, we can conclude the first possibility must be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
