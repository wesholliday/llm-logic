The modified version adds \"or blimple blurble flibbit\" to the original statement.  In logic, if a statement is true, then adding any alternative possibility to it using \"or\" will still result in a true statement. This is because an \"or\" statement is true if at least one of its components is true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
