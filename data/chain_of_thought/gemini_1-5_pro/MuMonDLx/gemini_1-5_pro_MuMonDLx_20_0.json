If the wozzle MUST be floob, then it is always floob.  A statement saying the wozzle must be EITHER floob OR glorp would still allow for the wozzle to always be floob.  This is basically like saying \"Since it must be Tuesday, can we say it must be either Tuesday or Wednesday?\" which is obviously true.\nAnswer: yes \n"
