The new statement introduces the possibility of the grooble being used with a \"snorkel\" as well.  Since the original statement doesn't tell us anything about \"snorkels,\" we don't know if a zizz grooble can be used with one.  Therefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
