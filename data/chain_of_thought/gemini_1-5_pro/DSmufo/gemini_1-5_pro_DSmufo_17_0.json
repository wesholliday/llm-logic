This means the scarf could be somewhere else, it's not obligated to be on the coat rack.\n\n* **Statement 2:** Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack. This gives us two possibilities, and says one of them MUST be true.\n\n* **Putting it together:** Since Statement 1 tells us the scarf doesn't HAVE to be on the coat rack, and Statement 2 says it has to be either on the coat rack OR in the backpack, the only remaining possibility is that it's in the backpack.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
