This means the watch could be somewhere else.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser. This gives us two possibilities.\n* **Conclusion:** The watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nSince Premise 1 tells us the watch doesn't *have* to be on his wrist, and Premise 2 gives us only two options, the watch being on the dresser is the only remaining possibility. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
