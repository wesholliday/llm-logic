This means the jacket could be somewhere else, but it doesn't tell us where.\n\n* **Statement 2:** Either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair. This gives us two possibilities, but only one can be true.\n\n* **Putting them together:** Since Statement 1 tells us the jacket doesn't *have* to be in the closet, Statement 2 forces us to conclude it must be on the chair. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
