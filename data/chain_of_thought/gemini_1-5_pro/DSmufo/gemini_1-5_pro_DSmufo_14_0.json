It could be elsewhere.\n\n* **Premise 2:** \"Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter.\" This gives us two possibilities for the milk's location.\n\n* **Putting them together:**  Since Premise 1 tells us the milk doesn't *have* to be in the fridge, and Premise 2 gives us only two options, we can conclude the remaining option must be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
