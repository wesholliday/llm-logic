This means the notebook could be somewhere else, but it doesn't tell us where.\n\n* **Premise 2:** Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer. This gives us two possibilities.\n\n* **Putting them together:** Since Premise 1 tells us the notebook doesn't *have* to be on the nightstand, and Premise 2 gives us only one other option (the drawer), we can conclude that the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
