This means the toy could be somewhere else, like the toy box.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box. This gives us two possibilities.\n* **Putting them together:** Since Statement 1 tells us the toy doesn't *have* to be on the bookshelf, and Statement 2 says it has to be either on the bookshelf OR in the toy box, the only remaining possibility is the toy box. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
