This means the phone might be ringing elsewhere, or not ringing at all.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the phone must be ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room. This presents two possibilities, but only one needs to be true.\n\nSince Premise 1 tells us the phone doesn't *have* to be ringing in the kitchen, Premise 2 can still be true if the phone is in the living room. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
