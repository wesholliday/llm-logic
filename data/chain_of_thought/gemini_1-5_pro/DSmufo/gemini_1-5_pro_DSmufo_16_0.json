It doesn't guarantee it's not there, just that it's not a certainty.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag.\"** This presents two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n\nNow, since statement 1 tells us the pen might NOT be on the desk, and statement 2 requires at least one of the options to be true, the only remaining possibility is that the pen is in the bag.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
