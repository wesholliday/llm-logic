This means the puzzle piece might be on the floor but isn't necessarily blending in, or it could be somewhere else entirely.\n\n* **Premise 2:** Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box. This gives us two possibilities.\n\n* **Reasoning:** Since Premise 1 tells us the piece isn't necessarily blending in on the floor, Premise 2 forces us to consider the second possibility: it is in the box. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
