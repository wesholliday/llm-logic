They could be elsewhere.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar\" - This gives us two possibilities, but it doesn't say both can't be true. \n\n* **Putting it together:**  Since the cookies don't *have* to be in the pantry (from statement 1), they could be in the jar. Statement 2 allows for this possibility.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
