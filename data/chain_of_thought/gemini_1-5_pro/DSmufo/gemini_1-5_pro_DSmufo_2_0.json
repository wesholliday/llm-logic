This means the book might be somewhere else, but it doesn't tell us where.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf. This gives us two possibilities, but only one can be true.\n\nSince Premise 1 tells us the book doesn't *have* to be on the table, and Premise 2 gives us only one other option, we can logically conclude the book must be on the shelf.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
