There are other possibilities.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the missing sock must be under the bed or it's in the laundry basket.\" This presents two options, and at least one must be true.\n\n* **Putting them together:** Since Statement 1 tells us the sock doesn't *have* to be under the bed, but Statement 2 says it must be in one of those two places, the only remaining possibility is the laundry basket. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
