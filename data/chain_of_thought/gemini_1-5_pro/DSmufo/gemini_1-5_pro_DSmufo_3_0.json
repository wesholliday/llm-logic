They might be in the cabinet but not dangling, or they might be in a completely different location.\n\n* **Statement 2:** Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\n    * This presents two possibilities, but Statement 1 eliminates the first possibility.\n\n* **Conclusion:** Since the keys can't be dangling in the cabinet (from Statement 1), and Statement 2 says they must be either dangling in the cabinet OR in the drawer, the only remaining possibility is that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
