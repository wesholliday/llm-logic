This means the shoes could be somewhere else, but not necessarily by the door.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the shoes must be lined up by the door or they are in the closet. This presents two options, and at least one must be true.\n\nSince Statement 1 tells us the shoes don't *have* to be by the door, and Statement 2 gives us only two options, the shoes must be in the other location. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
