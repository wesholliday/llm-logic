It could be somewhere else.\n\n* **Statement 2:** \"Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car.\" This gives us two possibilities, but it doesn't say both can't be true. \n\n* **Putting it together:**  Even though the umbrella doesn't *have* to be in the closet (from statement 1), statement 2 still leaves open the possibility that it *could* be in the closet.  \n\nAnswer: no \n"
