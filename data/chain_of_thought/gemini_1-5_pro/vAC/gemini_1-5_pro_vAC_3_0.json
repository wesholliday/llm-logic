(If P, then Q)\n* **Premise 2:** The book is a mystery novel. (Q)\n* **Conclusion:** The book was written by James. (P)\n\nThis argument structure is attempting to say that because the second part of the first premise is true (the book is a mystery novel), then the first part of the premise must also be true (James wrote it). \n\nHowever, this isn't necessarily true.  Just because James writes mystery novels doesn't mean he wrote *all* mystery novels. There could be other authors of mystery novels.\n\nThis form of argument is called \"affirming the consequent,\" and it's a common logical fallacy.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
