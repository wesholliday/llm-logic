(Q)\n* **Conclusion:** The doll was plastic. (P)\n\nThis argument structure is attempting to say that because the second part of the first premise is true (the truck was metal), then the first part of the premise must also be true (the doll was plastic). \n\nHowever, this isn't logically sound.  The original premise only states what happens if the doll IS plastic. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the truck is metal.  The truck being metal doesn't automatically mean the doll was plastic. There could be other reasons the truck is metal.\n\nThis is a common logical fallacy called \"affirming the consequent\".\n\nAnswer: no \n"
