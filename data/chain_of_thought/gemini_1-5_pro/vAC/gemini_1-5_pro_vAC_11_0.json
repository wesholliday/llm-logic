(Q)\n* **Conclusion:** The cake was chocolate. (P)\n\nThis argument structure is attempting to say that because the second part of the initial statement (If P, then **Q**) is true, then the first part (If **P**, then Q) must also be true. \n\nHowever, this isn't necessarily the case.  The original statement only tells us what happens if the cake IS chocolate. It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the muffins are blueberry.  Maybe the muffins are ALWAYS blueberry, regardless of the cake's flavor.\n\nThis is a common logical fallacy called \"affirming the consequent\". \n\nAnswer: no \n"
