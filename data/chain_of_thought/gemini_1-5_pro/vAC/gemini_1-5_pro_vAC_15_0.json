This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\n* **Why it's invalid:** Just because Erin took a train doesn't automatically mean Sam took a plane. There could be other reasons why Erin took a train.  The original statement only says what happens IF Sam takes a plane, not what happens if Erin takes a train.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
