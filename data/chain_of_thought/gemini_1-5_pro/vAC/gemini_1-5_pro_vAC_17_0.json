This tells us one part of the conditional relationship is true.\n* **Conclusion:** Ben ate pasta. The argument concludes that because the second part of the conditional statement is true, the first part must also be true.\n\nHowever, this isn't necessarily the case.  Just because Kate ate salad doesn't automatically mean Ben ate pasta. There could be other reasons why Kate ate salad.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
