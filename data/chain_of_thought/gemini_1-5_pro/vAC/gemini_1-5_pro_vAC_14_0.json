The first premise only states what happens IF the bear is in the cave. It doesn't guarantee the bear IS in the cave.  \n\nFor example, maybe the wolf always stays in the den, regardless of the bear's location.\n\nThis form of argument is called \"affirming the consequent,\" and it's a classic logical fallacy.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
