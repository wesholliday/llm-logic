(Q)\n* **Conclusion:** The car was red. (P)\n\nThis argument structure is attempting to say that because the second part of the initial \"If, then\" statement is true (the truck was blue), then the first part must also be true (the car was red). \n\nHowever, this isn't logically sound.  The original statement only guarantees that *if* the car is red, *then* the truck is blue. It doesn't work in reverse.  \n\n**Example:** Imagine the car is green, and the truck is blue. Premise 1 still holds true (if the car was red, the truck would be blue), Premise 2 is true (the truck is blue), but the conclusion is false (the car is not red).\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
