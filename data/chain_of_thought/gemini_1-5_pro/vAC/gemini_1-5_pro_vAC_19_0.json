This is a conditional statement.\n* **Premise 2:** Jen watched basketball (Q).\n* **Conclusion:** Tom watched football (P).\n\nThe argument is trying to conclude that because the second part of the conditional statement (Q) is true, the first part (P) must also be true. \n\nHowever, this isn't how conditional statements work.  Consider this example:\n\n* If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).\n* The ground is wet (Q).\n* Therefore, it's raining (P).\n\nThe ground could be wet for many reasons other than rain.  Just because the second part of the conditional statement is true doesn't guarantee the first part is also true.\n\nTherefore, the original argument is not logically valid.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
