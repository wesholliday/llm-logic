(Q)\n* **Conclusion:** Jeff played basketball. (P)\n\nThis argument structure is attempting to say that because the second part of the first premise (Q) is true, then the first part of the first premise (P) must also be true. \n\nHowever, this isn't necessarily the case.  The first premise only states what happens if Jeff played basketball. It doesn't guarantee that Jeff playing basketball is the *only* reason Amy would play tennis. There could be other reasons Amy played tennis.\n\nTherefore, this argument form is not logically valid because the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premises.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
