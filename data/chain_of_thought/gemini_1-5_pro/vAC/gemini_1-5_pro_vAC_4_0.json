We can represent this as: If A, then B.\n* **Premise 2:** The robot visited Jupiter (B).\n* **Conclusion:** The alien visited Mars (A).\n\nThe argument structure is: If A then B, B therefore A. This is similar to a common logical fallacy called \"affirming the consequent\". \n\n**Here's why it's not valid:**\n\nJust because the robot visited Jupiter doesn't automatically mean the alien visited Mars. There could be other reasons the robot went to Jupiter. \n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine the rule is \"If it's raining (A), then the ground is wet (B).\"  We know the ground is wet (B). Does that mean it MUST be raining (A)? No, the ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled something, etc.).\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
