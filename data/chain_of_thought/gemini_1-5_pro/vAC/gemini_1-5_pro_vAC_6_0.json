(Q)\n* **Conclusion:** Sue chose pizza. (P)\n\nThis argument structure is attempting to say that because the second part of the first premise (Q) is true, then the first part of the first premise (P) must also be true. \n\nHowever, this isn't necessarily the case.  The first premise only states what happens if Sue chooses pizza. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Bob chooses pasta.  Bob choosing pasta could be caused by something completely unrelated to Sue's choice.\n\nFor example, maybe Bob always chooses pasta, regardless of what Sue does. \n\n**Answer:** no \n"
