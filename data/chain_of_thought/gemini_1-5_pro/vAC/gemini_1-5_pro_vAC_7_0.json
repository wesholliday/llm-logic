This is a conditional statement.\n* **Premise 2:** Chris finished the race is true. This confirms the second part of our conditional statement.\n* **Conclusion:** Alex finished the race. \n\nThe question is whether the conclusion *must* be true if the premises are true.  Consider this: Chris could finish the race even if Alex didn't.  Premise 1 only tells us what happens if Alex finishes; it doesn't guarantee Alex finished.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
