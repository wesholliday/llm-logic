(M)\n* **Conclusion:** The vampire was awake. (V)\n\nThis argument structure is similar to a common logical fallacy called \"affirming the consequent\".  Here's why it's not valid:\n\n* **Just because the mummy being awake is a consequence of the vampire being awake, it doesn't mean the mummy being awake *guarantees* the vampire is also awake.**  There could be other reasons the mummy was awake. \n\n**Example:**  Maybe the mummy woke up because a loud noise startled it, regardless of whether the vampire was awake or not.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
