(Q)\n* **Conclusion:** The shirt was cotton. (P)\n\nThis argument structure is attempting to say that because the second part of the initial \"If, then\" statement is true, the first part must also be true. \n\nHowever, this isn't necessarily the case.  The original statement only tells us what happens if the shirt IS cotton. It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the pants are denim.  Perhaps the pants are *always* denim, regardless of the shirt material.\n\nThis is a common logical fallacy called \"affirming the consequent\". \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
