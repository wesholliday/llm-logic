This sets up a conditional relationship. \n* **Premise 2:** Sue was at the wedding. This confirms the second part of the conditional statement in Premise 1.\n* **Conclusion:** Mary was at the wedding.  The argument is trying to conclude the first part of the conditional statement in Premise 1 based on Premise 2.\n\nHowever, this is a fallacy called \"affirming the consequent.\"  Just because Sue being at the wedding guarantees Mary was *doesn't* mean Mary being at the wedding is the *only* way Sue could have been there. \n\n**Example:**  Maybe Sue's brother was also getting married that day! Sue being at the wedding doesn't automatically mean Mary was there too.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
