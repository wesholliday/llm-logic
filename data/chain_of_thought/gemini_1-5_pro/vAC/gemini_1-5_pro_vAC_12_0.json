(Q)\n* **Conclusion:** Joe went to the park. (P)\n\nThis argument structure is attempting to say that because the second part of the first premise (Q) is true, then the first part of the first premise (P) must also be true. \n\nHowever, this isn't necessarily the case.  The first premise only states what happens if Joe goes to the park. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Lucy goes to the zoo.  It's possible Lucy goes to the zoo for other reasons entirely.\n\nThis is a common logical fallacy called \"affirming the consequent\".\n\nAnswer: no \n"
