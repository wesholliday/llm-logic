This sets up a conditional relationship. \n* **Premise 2:** The cat was outside. This tells us a fact about the cat.\n* **Conclusion:** The dog was inside. This is what the argument is trying to prove.\n\nThe issue here is that even though the cat being outside aligns with the first premise, it doesn't automatically mean the dog *must* be inside.  There could be other reasons the cat was outside. \n\nFor example, maybe the cat enjoys being outside even when the dog is also outside. The argument makes an assumption that the only reason the cat would be outside is if the dog was inside.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
