This is a conditional statement, where the vampire being awake is the *sufficient condition* for the mummy being awake.\n\n* **Question:** Can we infer \"If the vampire was NOT awake, then the mummy was NOT awake\"? This is asking if the original statement being true *automatically* means this new statement is also true.\n\n* **Reasoning:**  Just because the vampire being awake means the mummy is awake, it DOESN'T mean the mummy can't be awake WITHOUT the vampire awake.  There could be other reasons the mummy is awake.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
