We know in logic that's not always the case.\n\n**Counterexample:**\n\nImagine James writes only mystery novels.  However, other authors could write mystery novels too.  So:\n\n* If a book IS by James, it IS a mystery (original statement holds)\n* If a book IS NOT by James, it could STILL be a mystery (inference fails)\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
