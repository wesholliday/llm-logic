This is a conditional statement, where \"the cake was chocolate\" is the hypothesis and \"the muffins were blueberry\" is the conclusion.\n\n* **Inference we're testing:** If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry. This is trying to flip both the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement and see if it still holds true.\n\n* **Logical fallacy:** This is an example of the fallacy of denying the antecedent. Just because the cake wasn't chocolate doesn't automatically mean the muffins couldn't have been blueberry. There are other possibilities \u2013 maybe the muffins are always blueberry, regardless of the cake's flavor.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
