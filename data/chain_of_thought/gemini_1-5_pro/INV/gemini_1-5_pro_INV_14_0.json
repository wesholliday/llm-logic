            "content": "Let's break down this logic problem:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. This is a conditional statement, often written as \"If P, then Q\" where:\n    * P = The bear was in the cave\n    * Q = The wolf was in the den\n\n* **What we want to infer:** If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den. This is also a conditional statement:\n    * Not P = The bear was not in the cave\n    * Not Q = The wolf was not in the den\n\n* **The relationship:** The inference we're trying to make is called the \"inverse\" of the original statement.  The inverse switches both the hypothesis and conclusion to their negatives.\n\n* **Validity of the inverse:** The inverse of a conditional statement is NOT necessarily true, even if the original statement is true. \n\n**Example:** \nLet's say the original statement is true: If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).\n\nThe inverse would be: If it's not raining (not P), then the ground is not wet (not Q). This is not necessarily true \u2013 the ground could be wet for other reasons.\n\n**Back to our bears and wolves:** Just because the wolf is in the den when the bear is in the cave, doesn't mean the wolf can't be in the den at other times.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
