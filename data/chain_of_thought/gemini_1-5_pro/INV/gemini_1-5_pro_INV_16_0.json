            "content": "Let's break down this logic problem:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. This is a conditional statement, often written as \"If P, then Q\" where:\n    * P = The shirt was cotton\n    * Q = The pants were denim\n\n* **Inference we're testing:** If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim. This is also a conditional statement:\n    * Not P = The shirt was not cotton\n    * Not Q = The pants were not denim\n\n* **The Key:** This inference is trying to flip and negate the original statement.  This is called the *inverse* of the original statement.\n\n* **Why the inverse is not necessarily true:** Just because a shirt being cotton might imply denim pants, it doesn't mean a non-cotton shirt automatically means non-denim pants.  The pants could be made of many other materials!\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
