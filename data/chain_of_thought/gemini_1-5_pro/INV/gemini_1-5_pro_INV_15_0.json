It tells us that Erin taking a train is dependent on Sam taking a plane. \n* **What we want to infer:** \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\" This is the inverse of the original statement.\n\n**Here's why we can't make that inference:**\n\nThe original statement only tells us what happens when Sam takes a plane. It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if Sam *doesn't* take a plane.  Erin might still take a train even if Sam chooses a different mode of transportation.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine Sam takes a car instead of a plane. The original statement doesn't prevent Erin from still taking a train.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
