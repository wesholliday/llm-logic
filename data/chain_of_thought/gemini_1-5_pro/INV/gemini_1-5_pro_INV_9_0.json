            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Original statement:** If Lisa bought the red shirt (Let's call this 'A'), then Mark bought the blue shirt (Let's call this 'B').  This is a conditional statement: If A, then B.\n\n* **Question:** Can we infer \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt (Not A), then Mark did not buy the blue shirt (Not B)\"? This is also a conditional statement: If Not A, then Not B.\n\n* **Relationship:** The statement \"If Not A, then Not B\" is the inverse of the original statement \"If A, then B\". \n\n* **Logical Validity:** The inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement.  Just because the original statement is true, it doesn't mean the inverse is automatically true.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine Lisa bought a green shirt instead of the red one. The original statement (If A, then B) wouldn't tell us anything about what Mark would do in this case. He might still buy the blue shirt, or he might buy a different color.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
