            "content": "Let's break down this logic problem:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This is a conditional statement, where \"the doll was plastic\" is the hypothesis and \"the truck was metal\" is the conclusion.\n\n* **What we want to infer:** If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal. This is also a conditional statement.\n\n* **The relationship:** The statement we want to infer is the *inverse* of the original statement.  The inverse of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion.\n\n* **Validity of the inverse:** The inverse of a conditional statement is *not logically equivalent* to the original statement.  \n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine the original statement is true. It's possible the truck is *always* metal, regardless of what the doll is made of. In this case, the original statement holds true, but the inverse would be false.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
