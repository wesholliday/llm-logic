It doesn't say anything about what happens if Jeff *didn't* play basketball. \n\n* **What we want to infer:** If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis. This is trying to flip and negate the original statement.\n\n* **Logical fallacy:**  Just because Amy plays tennis when Jeff plays basketball doesn't mean she *only* plays tennis when Jeff plays basketball.  Amy could play tennis for other reasons, or even just because she felt like it.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
