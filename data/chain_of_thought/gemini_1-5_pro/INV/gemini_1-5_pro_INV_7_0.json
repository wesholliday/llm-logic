This means Chris finishing the race depends on Alex finishing the race. \n\n* **Question:** If Alex *didn't* finish the race, can we be sure Chris didn't finish either?\n\n* **Reasoning:** The original statement only tells us what happens if Alex *finishes*. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Alex *doesn't* finish.  Chris could still potentially finish the race even if Alex doesn't.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
