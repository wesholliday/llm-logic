It DOES NOT mean it's the ONLY situation where Kate eats salad. \n\n* **What we want to infer:** If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad. This is trying to flip the original statement and make it a strict cause-and-effect in both directions.\n\n* **Why this is flawed:**  Maybe Kate LOVES salad. She might eat salad even if Ben eats pizza, a burger, or nothing at all. The original statement doesn't restrict Kate's salad eating to just when Ben eats pasta.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
