            "content": "Let's break down this logic problem:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. This is a conditional statement, often written as \"If P, then Q\" where:\n    * P = the griffin was in the forest\n    * Q = the unicorn was in the forest\n\n* **Question:** Can we infer \"If the griffin was NOT in the forest, then the unicorn was NOT in the forest\"? This is asking about the inverse of the original statement.\n\n* **Thinking about the inverse:**  The inverse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not P, then not Q\".  Just because the original statement might be true, doesn't mean the inverse is automatically true. \n\n* **Example:** Let's say the rule is \"If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q)\". This is generally true. But the inverse, \"If it's not raining (not P), then the ground is not wet (not Q)\" is not always true. The ground could be wet for other reasons.\n\n* **Applying to our problem:**  Just because the unicorn being in the forest might depend on the griffin being there, doesn't mean the unicorn is *never* in the forest if the griffin isn't. There could be other reasons for the unicorn to be there.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
