This means whenever Sue picks pizza, Bob *must* pick pasta. \n* **Question:** Does this mean if Sue *doesn't* pick pizza, Bob *can't* pick pasta? \n* **Consider this:**  The original statement doesn't say anything about what happens if Sue chooses something else. Bob could still choose pasta even if Sue picks a salad.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
