It tells us that a red apple implies a yellow banana. \n* **The question:**  asks if we can flip the situation and negate both parts to infer \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\".\n* **Consider this:** Just because a red apple implies a yellow banana, it doesn't mean other scenarios are impossible. The banana could be yellow for other reasons entirely. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
