This means whenever Mary attends the wedding, Sue is guaranteed to be there too. \n\n* **What we want to infer:** If Mary was NOT at the wedding, then Sue was NOT at the wedding.\n\n* **Consider the possibilities:** The original statement only tells us what happens when Mary IS at the wedding. It doesn't say anything about what happens when Mary IS NOT at the wedding.  Sue could still be at the wedding even if Mary isn't.\n\n* **Example:** Imagine the rule is that everyone named Sue MUST attend the wedding, regardless of who else is there. In this case, the original statement holds true (if Mary is there, Sue is definitely there), but our desired inference is false (Mary not being there doesn't mean Sue isn't there).\n\nAnswer: no \n"
