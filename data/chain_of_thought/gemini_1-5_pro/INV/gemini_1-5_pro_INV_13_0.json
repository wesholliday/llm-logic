            "content": "Let's break down this logic problem:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the car was red, then the truck was blue. This is a conditional statement. It doesn't mean the truck is *always* blue, just that it *must* be blue if the car is red.\n\n* **Question:** Can we infer \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\"? This is trying to flip and negate the original statement.\n\n* **Reasoning:**  Just because the car isn't red doesn't tell us anything definitive about the truck's color. The truck could still be blue, or it could be another color. The original statement only dictates the truck's color when the car *is* red.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
