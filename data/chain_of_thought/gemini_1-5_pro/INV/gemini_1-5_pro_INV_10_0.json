This means whenever the dog is inside, the cat is guaranteed to be outside. \n\n* **Question:** Does this mean if the dog is NOT inside, the cat is NOT outside?  Not necessarily. The original statement only tells us what happens when the dog IS inside. It doesn't say anything about what happens when the dog is outside. The cat could be inside, outside, or riding a unicorn for all we know.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
