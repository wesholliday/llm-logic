This is a conditional statement, often written as \"If P, then Q\" where:\n    * P: The alien visited Mars\n    * Q: The robot visited Jupiter\n\n* **We're asked about:** If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter. This is also a conditional statement:\n    * Not P: The alien did not visit Mars\n    * Not Q: The robot did not visit Jupiter\n\n* **Important Logic:**  The original statement only tells us what happens when the alien *does* visit Mars. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the alien *doesn't* visit Mars. The robot could still visit Jupiter for other reasons.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
