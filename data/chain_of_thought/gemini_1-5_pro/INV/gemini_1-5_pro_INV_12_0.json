It doesn't say anything about what happens if Joe *didn't* go to the park. \n* **Question:** Can we infer \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\"? This is asking if the original statement being true forces this new statement to also be true.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe original statement only tells us about what happens when Joe goes to the park.  Lucy might go to the zoo for other reasons entirely.  \n\n**Example:** Maybe Lucy goes to the zoo every Sunday, regardless of Joe's park trips.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
