This is a conditional statement, often written as P \u2192 Q.\n\n* **Inference we're testing:** If Tom did not watch football (~P), then Jen did not watch basketball (~Q). This is also a conditional statement: ~P \u2192 ~Q.\n\n* **Important Note:** The original statement only tells us what happens when Tom *does* watch football. It doesn't say anything about what happens when he *doesn't* watch football. \n\n* **Counterexample:**  Jen could watch basketball even if Tom doesn't watch football. This wouldn't contradict the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
