Here's how it works:\n\n* **P:** Tom watched football\n* **Q:** Jen watched basketball\n\nStatement 1 tells us that if P is true, then Q must also be true. \n\nStatement 2 tells us that Q is NOT true. \n\nIf Q must be true whenever P is true, and we know Q is NOT true, then P cannot be true either. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
