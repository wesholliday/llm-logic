Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know the consequent is false (not Q), then we can infer the antecedent is false (not P).\n\n* **P:** The griffin was in the forest.\n* **Q:** The unicorn was in the forest.\n\nStatement 1 is our conditional statement (If P, then Q). Statement 2 tells us \"not Q\" (the unicorn was NOT in the forest). Therefore, we can conclude \"not P\" (the griffin was NOT in the forest).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
