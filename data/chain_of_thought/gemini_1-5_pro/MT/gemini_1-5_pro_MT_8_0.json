It's like saying \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet\". \n\nStatement 2 tells us the mummy is NOT awake.  Going back to our rain analogy, this is like saying \"The ground is not wet\".\n\nIf the ground isn't wet, we know it can't be raining. Similarly, if the mummy isn't awake, the vampire can't be awake (because a wakeful vampire always means a wakeful mummy).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
