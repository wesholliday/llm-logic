Statement 1 sets up a conditional: IF cotton shirt, THEN denim pants.  \n\nStatement 2 tells us the \"THEN\" part of that conditional is FALSE (no denim pants). \n\nTo have a true conditional statement, if the \"THEN\" part is false, the \"IF\" part MUST also be false.\n\nTherefore...\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
