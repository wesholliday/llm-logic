It doesn't mean Jeff *did* play basketball, only that *if* he did, then Amy played tennis.\n* **Statement 2:** Amy did not play tennis. This gives us concrete information about Amy's activities.\n\nNow let's consider the implication:\n\n* If Jeff *had* played basketball, then according to Statement 1, Amy would have played tennis.\n* But we know from Statement 2 that Amy *didn't* play tennis. \n* Therefore, Jeff could not have played basketball, because if he had, it would contradict our knowledge about Amy.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
