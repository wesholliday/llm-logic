It doesn't say the wolf is *always* in the den, only that it is *if* the bear is in the cave.\n\nStatement 2 tells us the wolf is definitely NOT in the den.  This means the \"if\" part of Statement 1 (the bear being in the cave) cannot be true. If it were true, the wolf would have to be in the den.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
