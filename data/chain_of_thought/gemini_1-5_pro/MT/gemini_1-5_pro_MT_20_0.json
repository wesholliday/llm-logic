It doesn't mean the apple *was* red, just that *if* it was, then the banana must have been yellow.\n* **Statement 2:** The banana was not yellow. This directly contradicts the potential outcome stated in the first statement. \n* **Reasoning:** Since the banana wasn't yellow, the condition in the first statement (apple being red) couldn't have been true. If the apple *had* been red, the banana *must* have been yellow according to our given information.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
