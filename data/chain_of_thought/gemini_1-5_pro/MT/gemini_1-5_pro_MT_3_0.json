Modus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know the consequent is false (not Q), then we can infer the antecedent is also false (not P).\n\n* **P:** The book was written by James\n* **Q:** The book is a mystery novel\n\nStatement 2 tells us \"not Q\" (the book is not a mystery novel).  Therefore, using Modus Tollens, we can conclude \"not P\" (the book was not written by James).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
