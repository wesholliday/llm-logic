Consider this:\n\n* **If** Lisa DID buy the red shirt, then Statement 1 would force Mark to have bought the blue shirt. \n* **But** we know Mark did NOT buy the blue shirt (Statement 2). \n\nThis creates a contradiction. The only way to resolve it is to conclude that Lisa could not have bought the red shirt.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
