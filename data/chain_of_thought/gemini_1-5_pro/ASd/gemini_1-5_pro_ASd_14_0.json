This implies that studying hard is the *sufficient* condition to pass the test. \n* **Inference:** If I study hard and the test is in Chinese, I will pass the test. This adds an extra condition \u2013 the test being in Chinese.\n\nNow, does the original statement guarantee passing even if the test is in Chinese?  We don't know the person's Chinese proficiency. Studying hard might not be enough if they don't understand the language.\n\nTherefore, the inference introduces a new factor that could easily invalidate the original statement's guarantee.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
