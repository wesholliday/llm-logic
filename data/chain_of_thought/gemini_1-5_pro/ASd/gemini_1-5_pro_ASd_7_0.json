            "content": "Let's break this down:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm. This sets up a conditional relationship where a working oven leads to a warm kitchen.\n\n* **New statement:** If the oven is on AND the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm. This adds a new condition \u2013 the pilot light being out. \n\n* **The problem:** The original statement doesn't tell us what happens if the oven is on BUT the pilot light is out. It's possible the oven wouldn't function in this scenario, meaning the kitchen wouldn't warm up.\n\n* **Conclusion:** We can't definitively say the kitchen will be warm just because the oven is on if the pilot light is out. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
