This sets up a conditional relationship where paying the bill guarantees continued service.\n\n* **Inference:** If the bill is paid AND the check bounces, then the services will continue. This adds a new condition: the check bouncing. \n\n* **Contradiction:** A bounced check means the bill is NOT actually paid. This directly contradicts the original statement's condition for continued service.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that services will continue if the check bounces, even if an attempt was made to pay.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
