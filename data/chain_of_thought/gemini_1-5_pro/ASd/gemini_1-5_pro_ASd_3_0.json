This statement sets up a conditional relationship where being in the garage is sufficient for the car's safety. \n\n* **New statement:** If the car is in the garage and the garage is flooding, then it is safe. This statement adds a new condition \u2013 the garage flooding. \n\n* **Reasoning:** The original statement doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the garage floods. It only guarantees safety *if* the car is in the garage, without specifying other conditions.  The flooding introduces a new element that could very well make the garage unsafe, even if the car is inside.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
