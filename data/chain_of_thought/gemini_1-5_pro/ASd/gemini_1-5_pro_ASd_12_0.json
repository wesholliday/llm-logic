This sets up a conditional relationship where finishing homework is necessary for playing video games. \n* **Inference:** If I finish my homework AND my computer catches on fire, I can play video games. This adds an additional condition that must be met.\n* **Logic:** The original statement only guarantees the possibility of playing video games if homework is done. It says nothing about other factors that might prevent it. A broken computer would certainly prevent playing video games.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
