This implies there are conditions necessary for a match to light (being struck) and if those conditions are met, the match will light. \n\n* **New statement:** If the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will light. This statement introduces a new condition: the match being soaked in water.\n\n* **Reasoning:** We know that soaking a match in water generally prevents it from lighting, even if struck. This new condition contradicts the expected outcome of the original statement.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
