This sets up a conditional relationship where shipping guarantees arrival today.\n\n* **New statement:** If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today. This adds an extra condition \u2013 being misrouted. \n\n* **Crucially, the original statement doesn't account for misrouting.** It only guarantees arrival if shipped.  Misrouting introduces a factor that could easily delay arrival, invalidating the original guarantee.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
