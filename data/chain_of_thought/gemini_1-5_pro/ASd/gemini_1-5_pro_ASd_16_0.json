It makes no mention of what might happen under other conditions, such as a drought.  Droughts significantly impact lawn health, often counteracting the effects of fertilizer. \n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that the lawn will be lush and green simply because it was fertilized if there is also a drought.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
