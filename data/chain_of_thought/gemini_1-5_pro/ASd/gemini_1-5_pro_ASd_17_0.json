The original statement implies that changing the oil is sufficient for the car to run smoothly. \n2. The inference adds a condition: \"the transmission is shot.\" \n3. A \"shot\" transmission means a major problem that would likely prevent the car from running smoothly, regardless of the oil change.\n\n**Therefore, the inference contradicts the original statement.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
