This sets up a conditional relationship where going to the concert is expected to lead to a good time. \n* **Inference:** If we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time. This adds a significant negative event (a bomb going off) to the condition.\n\nThe original statement does not account for unforeseen and highly negative circumstances like a bomb going off. It's illogical to assume that a good time would still be had if such an event occurred. \n\n**Answer:** no \n"
