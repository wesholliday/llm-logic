This implies that a full gas tank is a necessary condition for the car to run. \n* **Inference:** If you fill up the gas tank and there is a hole in it, the car will run. This adds an extra condition \u2013 a hole in the gas tank.\n\nNow, a hole in the gas tank would likely prevent the car from running, even if the tank is initially filled.  This is because the gas would leak out.\n\nTherefore, the inference is not logically sound.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
