This implies the medication is effective in its intended purpose.\n* **Inference:** If I take medication that expired, I will feel better. This introduces a new factor: expiration. \n* **Expired Medication:** Expired medication may be less effective or even harmful.  It's not guaranteed to make someone feel better.\n\n**Therefore, we cannot logically infer that taking expired medication will make someone feel better, even if the original premise about effective medication is true.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
