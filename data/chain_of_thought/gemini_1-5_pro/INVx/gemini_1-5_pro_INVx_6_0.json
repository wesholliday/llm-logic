It doesn't matter if \"grommet\", \"sploffed\", or \"frink\" are real things.\n\n* **We're given a conditional statement:** \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\" This has the form \"If P, then Q\" where:\n    * P = \"the grommet was sploffed\"\n    * Q = \"the grommet plopped the frink\"\n\n* **We're asked about the inverse:** The question asks if we can infer \"If the grommet was NOT sploffed, then the grommet did NOT plop the frink.\" This has the form \"If NOT P, then NOT Q\".\n\n* **The inverse is not always true:** Just because \"If P, then Q\" is true, it doesn't automatically mean \"If NOT P, then NOT Q\" is also true. \n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine this statement: \"If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).\" This is generally true. \n\nBut the inverse, \"If it's not raining (NOT P), then the ground is not wet (NOT Q)\" is not always true. The ground could be wet for other reasons (like sprinklers).\n\n**Conclusion:** We cannot automatically infer the inverse of a conditional statement.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
