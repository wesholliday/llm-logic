We're dealing with the structure of the statement, not the literal meaning.\n\n* **Think of it like this:** \"If A, then B\" \n\n    * Where A = \"the clug was fleeked\"\n    * And B = \"the clug snugged\"\n\n* **The question is:** Does \"If NOT A, then NOT B\" automatically follow?\n\n* **Consider a real-world example:** \"If it's raining (A), then the ground is wet (B).\"  Does this mean that if it's NOT raining (NOT A), the ground is NOT wet (NOT B)? No! The ground could be wet for other reasons.\n\n* **Therefore, we cannot make that inference.**  Just because something happens when the clug is fleeked doesn't mean it *can't* happen if the clug isn't fleeked.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
