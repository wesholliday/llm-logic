            "content": "Let's break down this logic problem:\n\n* **We're given a conditional statement:** \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\" This has the classic \"If P, then Q\" form, where:\n    * P = the splat was morphed\n    * Q = the splat quanked\n\n* **We're asked about the inverse:**  The question \"If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank\" is asking about the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not P, then not Q.\"\n\n* **The inverse is not always true:** Just because a conditional statement is true, it doesn't mean its inverse is automatically true. \n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine the statement: \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\" This is generally true. But the inverse, \"If it's not raining, then the ground is not wet,\" is not always true. The ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled something, etc.).\n\n**Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether the splat not being morphed means it didn't quank.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
