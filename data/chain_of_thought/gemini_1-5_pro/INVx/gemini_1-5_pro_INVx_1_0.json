We're dealing with abstract logic here.\n* **The original statement is in the form \"If P, then Q\".**  Where P is \"the flugel was blimmed\" and Q is \"the flugel was zargled\".\n* **We're asked about the statement \"If not P, then not Q\".** This is called the *inverse* of the original statement.\n\n**Important Logic Point:** The inverse of a statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true. \n\n**Example:**\n* **Original:** If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q). (This is generally true)\n* **Inverse:** If it's not raining (not P), then the ground is not wet (not Q). (This is not always true - the sprinklers could be on!)\n\n**Therefore, we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
