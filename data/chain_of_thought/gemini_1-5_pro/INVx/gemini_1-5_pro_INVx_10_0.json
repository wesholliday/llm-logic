It tells us that being \"sproinged\" is enough to guarantee being \"garpled.\" \n\nNow let's consider the inference:\n\n* **If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled.** This is trying to reverse the relationship. It's saying that NOT being \"sproinged\" means it couldn't have been \"garpled.\"\n\nHere's why this inference is not valid:\n\nThe original statement only tells us what happens when something IS \"sproinged.\" It doesn't say anything about what happens if it's NOT \"sproinged.\"  Maybe there are other ways to get \"garpled\" besides being \"sproinged.\"\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
