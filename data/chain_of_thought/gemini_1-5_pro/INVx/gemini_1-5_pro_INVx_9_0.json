We only care about the *structure* of the statements.\n\n* **The first statement is in the form \"If P, then Q\".**  Where P is \"the twonk was plinked\" and Q is \"it was varnished\".\n\n* **The second statement is asking about the inverse: \"If not P, then not Q\".**\n\n* **In logic, the inverse of a statement is not necessarily true.**  Just because P leads to Q doesn't mean that not P leads to not Q. \n\n**Example:** If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).  This is true. But if it's not raining (not P), the ground could still be wet for other reasons (not Q is not guaranteed).\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
