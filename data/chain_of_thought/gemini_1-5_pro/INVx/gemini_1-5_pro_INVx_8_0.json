            "content": "Let's break down this logic problem:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled. This is a conditional statement, often written as \"If P, then Q\" where:\n    * P = the sprocket was cranked\n    * Q = the sprocket was daggled\n\n* **Question:** Can we infer \"If the sprocket was NOT cranked, then the sprocket was NOT daggled\"? This is asking about the inverse of the original statement. The inverse is formed by negating both P and Q:\n    * NOT P = the sprocket was not cranked\n    * NOT Q = the sprocket was not daggled\n\n* **Important Logic Rule:**  The inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Just because \"If P, then Q\" is true, it doesn't mean \"If NOT P, then NOT Q\" is also true.\n\n**Example:** \nLet's say \"If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).\" This is generally true. But the inverse, \"If it's not raining (NOT P), then the ground is not wet (NOT Q)\" is not always true. The ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, etc.).\n\n**Back to the sprockets:** We cannot automatically assume that if the sprocket wasn't cranked, it wasn't daggled. There might be other ways for a sprocket to be daggled.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
