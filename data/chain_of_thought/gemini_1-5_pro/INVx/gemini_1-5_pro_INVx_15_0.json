We're dealing with the logic of the statement, not the meaning of the words.\n\n* **Think of it like a code:**  Let's say \"dreb\" = \"car\", \"vroombed\" = \"driven\", and \"spened\" = \"washed\".  The original statement becomes: \"If the car was driven, then the car was washed.\"\n\n* **Does that mean if the car wasn't driven, it wasn't washed?** Not necessarily! Maybe it was washed anyway. \n\n* **The original statement only tells us what happens if the dreb WAS vroombed.** It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if it wasn't.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
