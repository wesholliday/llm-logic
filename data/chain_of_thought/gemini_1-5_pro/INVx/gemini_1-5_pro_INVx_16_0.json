            "content": "Let's break down this logic problem:\n\n* **We don't know what \"sneg\", \"crampled\", \"sproted\", or \"frink\" mean.**  This is intentional. The problem is testing our ability to understand logical structure, not the meaning of the words.\n\n* **We're given a statement in the form \"If A, then B\".**  Where A is \"the sneg was crampled\" and B is \"the sneg sproted the frink\".\n\n* **We're asked if we can infer \"If not A, then not B\".** This is essentially asking if the original statement's inverse is also true.\n\n* **In logic, the inverse of a statement is not always true.**  Just because A leads to B, doesn't mean that not A automatically leads to not B. \n\n**Example:** If it's raining (A), then the ground is wet (B). This is true. But the inverse, \"If it's not raining (not A), then the ground is not wet (not B)\" is not necessarily true. The ground could be wet for other reasons.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
