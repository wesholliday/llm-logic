In that case, the original statement would be true (because if a shank WAS plooked, it would also be nugged). However, the inverse would be false (because even shanks that weren't plooked would still be nugged).\n\n**In short, the original statement doesn't tell us what happens if a shank wasn't plooked.**\n\nAnswer: no \n"
