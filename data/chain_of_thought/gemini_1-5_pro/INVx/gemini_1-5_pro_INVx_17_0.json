We're dealing with the structure of the argument, not the specific words.\n* **Think of it like this:** \"If A, then B\".  The question is asking if we can assume \"If not A, then not B\".\n\nThis is the structure of a common logical fallacy called \"denying the antecedent\".  Just because A leads to B, doesn't mean that the absence of A leads to the absence of B. \n\n**Example:** \"If it's raining, the ground is wet\".  Does that mean if it's not raining, the ground is *not* wet? No! There could be other reasons for wet ground.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
