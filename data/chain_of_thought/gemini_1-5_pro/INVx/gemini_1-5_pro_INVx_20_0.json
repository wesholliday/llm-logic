We're dealing with the structure of the statement, not the specific words.\n\n* **Think of it like this:** \"If A, then B\".  The question is asking if we can assume \"If NOT A, then NOT B\".\n\n* **This is called the inverse of the original statement.** The inverse is not always true, even if the original statement is.\n\n* **Example:** \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\"  This is generally true. But the inverse, \"If it's not raining, then the ground is not wet\" is not always true. The ground could be wet for other reasons.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
