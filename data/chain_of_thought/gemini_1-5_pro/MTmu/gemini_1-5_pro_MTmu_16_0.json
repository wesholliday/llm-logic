This weakens the connection made in Statement 1.  \n\nConsider these possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1:** The shirt WAS cotton, but the pants were something other than denim. This would still fit both statements.\n* **Possibility 2:** The shirt WAS NOT cotton. This would also fit both statements.\n\nSince we have at least one possibility where the shirt WAS cotton, we cannot definitively say the shirt was NOT cotton.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
