Statement 1 tells us that if Mary was there, Sue *must* have been too. \n* **Contradiction:** But Statement 2 says Sue did *not* have to be at the wedding. This creates a contradiction if we assume Mary was present.\n* **Resolution:** The only way to resolve this contradiction is to conclude that our initial assumption (that Mary was at the wedding) must be false.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
