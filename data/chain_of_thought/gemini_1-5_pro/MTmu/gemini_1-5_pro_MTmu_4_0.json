It doesn't say the robot *did* visit Jupiter, only that it *must* have if the alien visited Mars.\n* **Putting it together:** Since the robot visiting Jupiter is not a certainty (from Premise 2), the condition in Premise 1 might not have been met. This means the alien visiting Mars is also not a certainty.\n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
