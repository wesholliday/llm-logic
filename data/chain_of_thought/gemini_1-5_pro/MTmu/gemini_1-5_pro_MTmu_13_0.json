Look back at Statement 1. It only says the truck *must* be blue *if* the car is red.  It doesn't say anything about what must happen if the car *isn't* red. \n\nTherefore, even if the truck wasn't necessarily blue, the car could still be red.  There might be other situations where the truck wouldn't be blue.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
