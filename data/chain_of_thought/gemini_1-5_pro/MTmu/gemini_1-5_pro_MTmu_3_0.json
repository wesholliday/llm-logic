Modus tollens works like this:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nLet's map our premises to this structure:\n\n* P: The book was written by James.\n* Q: The book must be a mystery novel.\n\nWe have \"If P, then Q\" (Premise 1) and \"Not Q\" (Premise 2). Therefore, we can conclude \"Not P\".\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
