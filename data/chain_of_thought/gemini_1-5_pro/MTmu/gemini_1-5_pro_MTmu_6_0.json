This means there are scenarios where Bob might choose something else. \n\nImportantly, Statement 1 only makes a claim about Bob IF Sue chose pizza. It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if Sue chooses something else.  \n\nTherefore, even if Bob doesn't have to choose pasta, it's still possible Sue chose pizza, and something else caused Bob to make a different choice.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
