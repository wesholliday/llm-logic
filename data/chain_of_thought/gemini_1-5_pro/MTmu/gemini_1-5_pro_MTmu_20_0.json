            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Statement 1:** If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. This is a conditional statement, meaning it sets up a relationship where the first part (apple being red) is a condition for the second part (banana being yellow) to be true. \n\n* **Statement 2:** It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow. This tells us the second part of our conditional statement is false.\n\n* **Reasoning:**  If the banana doesn't *have* to be yellow, it could be another color.  Since the banana being yellow was dependent on the apple being red, and we know the banana doesn't have to be yellow, the apple couldn't have been red.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
