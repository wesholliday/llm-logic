Statement 1 only makes Jen watching basketball a certainty *if* Tom watched football.  \n\nIf Tom *didn't* watch football, Statement 1 is irrelevant, and Jen might or might not have watched basketball for completely unrelated reasons.  \n\nSince we can't be sure about Tom's football watching based on this, the inference is not valid.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
