However, Statement 2 tells us this isn't true. Therefore, Possibility 1 can't be correct.\n\n* **Possibility 2: Alex did not finish the race.** This scenario doesn't clash with either statement. Statement 1 only applies if Alex finished the race. Statement 2 doesn't depend on Alex finishing the race.\n\nSince Possibility 1 leads to a contradiction, we're left with Possibility 2.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
