Consider these possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1:** Lisa bought the red shirt, and something else happened that meant Mark didn't have to buy the blue shirt. This scenario fits both statements.\n* **Possibility 2:** Lisa didn't buy the red shirt. This also fits both statements, as Statement 1 only applies if Lisa DID buy the red shirt.\n\nSince we have at least one scenario where the statements hold true, but Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, we cannot definitively conclude that Lisa didn't buy it.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
