There are other possibilities for Erin's mode of transportation.\n* **Relate to Statement 1:** Statement 1 only makes a claim IF Sam took a plane. Since Erin taking a train isn't a must, it doesn't automatically mean Sam didn't take a plane. Sam taking a plane is still a possibility, just not one that forces Erin onto a train.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
