This means there are situations where the cat could have been inside.\n* **Statement 1** only applies if the dog was inside. If the dog wasn't inside, then the statement about the cat being outside doesn't have to be true.\n* Since we don't know for sure where the cat was, we can't definitively say whether the dog was inside or not. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
