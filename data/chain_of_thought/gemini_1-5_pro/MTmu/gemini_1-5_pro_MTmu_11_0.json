This doesn't automatically mean the cake wasn't chocolate.  Maybe the muffins could have been blueberry OR something else. \n\nConsider this example:\n\n* **Rule:** If it's raining, I take an umbrella.\n* **Fact:** I didn't take an umbrella.\n\nCan we conclude it wasn't raining? Yes! If it were raining, I would have taken an umbrella.\n\nNow let's change the rule:\n\n* **Rule:** If it's raining, I *might* take an umbrella.\n* **Fact:** I didn't take an umbrella.\n\nCan we now conclude it wasn't raining? No! Maybe it was raining, but I chose not to take an umbrella.\n\nThe original problem follows this second pattern. Just because the muffins didn't *have* to be blueberry doesn't mean the cake wasn't chocolate.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
