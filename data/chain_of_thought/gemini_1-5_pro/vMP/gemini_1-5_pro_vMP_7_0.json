This sets up a conditional statement where Alex finishing is the requirement for Chris finishing.\n* **Premise 2:** Alex finished the race. This confirms the condition set in Premise 1 is met.\n* **Conclusion:** Chris finished the race. Since the condition in Premise 1 is met (Alex finished), the consequence (Chris finished) must also be true.\n\nThis follows a logical structure called Modus Ponens, which is a valid argument form.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
