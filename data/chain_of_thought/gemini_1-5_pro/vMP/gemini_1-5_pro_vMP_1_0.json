            "content": "Let's break down this argument:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This sets up a conditional statement where Mary being at the wedding guarantees Sue being there too.\n* **Premise 2:** Mary was at the wedding. This confirms the condition set up in the first premise.\n* **Conclusion:** Sue was at the wedding.  Since the first premise states Sue being at the wedding is a guaranteed outcome if Mary is there, and the second premise confirms Mary was there, the conclusion logically follows.\n\nThis argument structure is known as *modus ponens*, a classic example of a valid deductive argument.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
