(This sets up a conditional relationship)\n* **Premise 2:** Sam took a plane. (This confirms the \"if\" part of our conditional statement)\n* **Conclusion:** Erin took a train. (This is what the conditional statement said would happen if Sam took a plane)\n\nThis argument structure follows a pattern called *modus ponens*, which is a valid form of logical argument. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
