This sets up a conditional statement where the griffin being in the forest is the antecedent, and the unicorn being in the forest is the consequent.\n* **Premise 2:** The griffin was in the forest. This confirms the antecedent of our conditional statement in Premise 1.\n* **Conclusion:** The unicorn was in the forest.  Since the antecedent is true, and the argument structure dictates that the consequent MUST follow if the antecedent is true, this conclusion is supported.\n\nThis argument structure is known as *modus ponens*, a classic example of a logically valid argument form.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
