It DOES NOT guarantee Sue actually chose pizza.\n* **Premise 2:** This premise confirms that the \"if\" part of our first premise is true. Sue DID choose pizza.\n* **Conclusion:** Because the \"if\" part of our first premise is true (Sue chose pizza), the \"then\" part MUST also be true (Bob chose pasta).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
