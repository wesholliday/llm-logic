This sets up a conditional statement where \"written by James\" is the hypothesis and \"is a mystery novel\" is the conclusion.\n* **Premise 2:** The book was written by James. This confirms the hypothesis from Premise 1.\n* **Conclusion:** The book is a mystery novel. Since the hypothesis of Premise 1 is confirmed, the conclusion of Premise 1 must also be true.\n\nThis follows a classic logical structure called *modus ponens*.  Modus ponens arguments are always valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
