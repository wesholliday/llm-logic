            "content": "Let's break down this argument:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. This sets up a conditional relationship - IF the shirt was cotton, THEN the pants were denim.\n* **Premise 2:** The shirt was cotton. This confirms the \"if\" part of our conditional statement in Premise 1.\n* **Conclusion:** The pants were denim.  Since the \"if\" part of our conditional statement is true, the \"then\" part must also be true.\n\nThis follows a classic logical structure called *modus ponens*. If P, then Q. P is true. Therefore, Q is true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
