This sets up a conditional relationship.\n* **Premise 2:** The vampire was awake. This confirms the \"if\" part of our conditional statement.\n* **Conclusion:** The mummy was awake.  Since the \"if\" part of our conditional statement is true, the \"then\" part must also be true.\n\nThis follows a classic logical structure called *modus ponens*.\n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
