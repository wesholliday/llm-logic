This sets up a conditional statement where a chocolate cake implies blueberry muffins.\n* **Premise 2:** The cake was chocolate. This confirms the \"if\" part of our conditional statement from Premise 1.\n* **Conclusion:** The muffins were blueberry.  Since the \"if\" part of our conditional statement is true, and the statement itself links chocolate cake to blueberry muffins, this conclusion logically follows.\n\nThis argument structure is a classic example of *modus ponens*, a valid form of logical argument.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
