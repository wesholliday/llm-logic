This sets up a conditional relationship.  \n* **Premise 2:** The doll was plastic. This confirms the \"if\" part of our conditional statement in Premise 1.\n* **Conclusion:** The truck was metal.  Since the condition in Premise 1 is met, this conclusion logically follows.\n\nThis argument structure is known as *modus ponens*, a classic example of a valid argument form.\n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
