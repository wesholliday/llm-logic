            "content": "Let's break down this argument:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. This sets up a conditional statement, where a red apple implies a yellow banana.\n* **Premise 2:** The apple was red. This confirms the \"if\" part of our conditional statement.\n* **Conclusion:** The banana was yellow.  Since the condition in Premise 1 is met (red apple), the conclusion (yellow banana) should follow.\n\nThis follows a classic logical structure called *modus ponens*. If the conditional statement is true, and the first part (the antecedent) is true, then the second part (the consequent) must also be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
