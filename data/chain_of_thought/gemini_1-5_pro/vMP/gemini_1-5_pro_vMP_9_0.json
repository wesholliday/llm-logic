This sets up a conditional statement where Lisa buying the red shirt is the *hypothesis* and Mark buying the blue shirt is the *conclusion*.\n* **Premise 2:** Lisa bought the red shirt. This confirms the *hypothesis* of our conditional statement.\n* **Conclusion:** Mark bought the blue shirt. Since the *hypothesis* of our conditional statement is true, and the statement itself links the hypothesis to this conclusion, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nThis form of argument is called *modus ponens*, and it's a fundamental rule of logic.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
