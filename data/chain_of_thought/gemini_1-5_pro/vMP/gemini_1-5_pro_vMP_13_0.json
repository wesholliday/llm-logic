This sets up a conditional statement, where the car being red is the condition for the truck being blue.\n* **Premise 2:** The car was red. This confirms the condition set in the first premise.\n* **Conclusion:** The truck was blue.  Since the condition in premise 1 is met, the conclusion follows directly.\n\nThis follows a classic logical structure called *modus ponens*. If the conditional statement is true, and the condition is met, the conclusion must be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
