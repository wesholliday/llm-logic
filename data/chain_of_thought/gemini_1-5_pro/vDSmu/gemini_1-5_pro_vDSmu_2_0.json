This presents two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table. This eliminates one of the possibilities presented in Premise 1. \n* **Conclusion:** The book is on the shelf.  Since one possibility was eliminated, this conclusion argues the remaining possibility must be true.\n\nThis follows a classic logical structure called a disjunctive syllogism. If one option in an \"either/or\" statement is ruled out, the other option must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
