This sets up two possibilities.\n* **Premise 2:**  We are told it's NOT on the coat rack. This eliminates one possibility.\n* **Conclusion:** Therefore, the scarf MUST be in the backpack. This is the only remaining possibility.\n\nThis follows a classic logical structure called a \"disjunctive syllogism.\" If one option in an \"either/or\" statement is ruled out, the other must be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
