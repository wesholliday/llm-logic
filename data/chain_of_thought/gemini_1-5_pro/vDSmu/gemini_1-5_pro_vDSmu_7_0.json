This presents two possibilities.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet. This eliminates one of the possibilities presented in Premise 1.\n* **Conclusion:** The umbrella is in the car.  Since one possibility was eliminated, this conclusion follows the remaining possibility.\n\nThis argument structure is called a disjunctive syllogism.  Disjunctive syllogisms are logically valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
