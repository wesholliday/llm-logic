This sets up a classic \"either/or\" scenario.\n* **Premise 2:**  We are told one of the possibilities (under the bed) is not true.\n* **Conclusion:**  The conclusion states that the remaining possibility (in the laundry basket) must be true.\n\n**Reasoning:** This follows a valid logical structure called disjunctive syllogism. If we have two options, and one is ruled out, the other must be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
