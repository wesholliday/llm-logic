This presents two possibilities.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom. This eliminates one of the possibilities presented in Premise 1.\n* **Conclusion:** The cat is napping on the couch.  Since one possibility was eliminated, this conclusion follows the remaining possibility.\n\nThis follows a valid logical structure called disjunctive syllogism.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
