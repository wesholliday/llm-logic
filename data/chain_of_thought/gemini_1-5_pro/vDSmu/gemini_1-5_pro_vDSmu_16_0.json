This presents two possibilities.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk. This eliminates one of the possibilities presented in Premise 1.\n* **Conclusion:** The pen is in my bag.  Since one possibility was eliminated, this conclusion follows the remaining possibility.\n\nThis follows a classic logical structure called a disjunctive syllogism. If one option in an \"either/or\" statement is ruled out, the other option must be true.\n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
