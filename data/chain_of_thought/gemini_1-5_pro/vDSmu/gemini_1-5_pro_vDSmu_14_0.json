This presents two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge. This eliminates one of the possibilities presented in Premise 1.\n* **Conclusion:** The milk is on the counter.  Since one possibility was eliminated, this conclusion argues that the remaining possibility must be true.\n\nThis follows a valid logical structure called disjunctive syllogism. If one option of an \"either/or\" statement is ruled out, the other option must be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
