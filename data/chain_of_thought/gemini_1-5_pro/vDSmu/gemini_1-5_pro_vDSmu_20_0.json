This presents two possibilities, only one of which needs to be true.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head. This eliminates one of the possibilities presented in Premise 1.\n* **Conclusion:** The sunglasses are in her bag.  Since one possibility was eliminated, the other possibility must be true.\n\nThis follows a classic logical structure called a disjunctive syllogism. If one option in an \"either/or\" statement is ruled out, the other option must be true.\n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
