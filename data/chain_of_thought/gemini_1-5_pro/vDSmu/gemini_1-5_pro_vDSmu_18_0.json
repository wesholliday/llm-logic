This sets up two possibilities.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand. This eliminates one of the possibilities.\n* **Conclusion:** The notebook is in the drawer.  Since one possibility was ruled out, this conclusion follows the remaining possibility.\n\nThis follows a valid logical structure called disjunctive syllogism.\n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
