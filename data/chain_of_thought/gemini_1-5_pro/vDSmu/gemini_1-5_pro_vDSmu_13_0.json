This sets up two possibilities.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf. This eliminates one of the possibilities.\n* **Conclusion:** The toy is in the toy box.  Since one possibility was ruled out, this conclusion follows the remaining possibility.\n\nThis is a classic example of a valid argument form called disjunctive syllogism. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
