This presents two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch. This eliminates one of the possibilities presented in Premise 1.\n* **Conclusion:** The newspaper is in the driveway.  Since one possibility was eliminated, this is the only remaining option.\n\nThis follows a classic logical structure called disjunctive syllogism. If one option of two must be true, and we eliminate one, the other must be the case.\n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
