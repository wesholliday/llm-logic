This presents two possibilities.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet. This eliminates one of the possibilities presented in Premise 1.\n* **Conclusion:** The jacket is draped over the chair.  Since one possibility was eliminated, this conclusion follows the remaining possibility.\n\nThis follows the logical structure of a valid argument form called disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
