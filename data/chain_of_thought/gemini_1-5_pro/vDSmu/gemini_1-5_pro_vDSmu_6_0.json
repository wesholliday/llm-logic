Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Disjunction:** The first premise presents two possibilities connected by \"or\".  \n2. **Denial:** The second premise denies the truth of one of those possibilities.\n3. **Affirmation:**  If one possibility is ruled out, the other possibility must be true.\n\nIn this case, since we know the phone isn't ringing in the kitchen (premise 2), and the only other option presented is that it's in the living room (premise 1), the conclusion logically follows.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
