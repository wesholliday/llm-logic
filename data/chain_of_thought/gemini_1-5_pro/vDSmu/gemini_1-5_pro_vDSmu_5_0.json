This sets up two possibilities.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry. This eliminates one of the possibilities.\n* **Conclusion:** The cookies are in the jar.  Since one possibility was ruled out, this conclusion follows the remaining possibility.\n\nThis is a classic example of a valid argument form called disjunctive syllogism.\n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
