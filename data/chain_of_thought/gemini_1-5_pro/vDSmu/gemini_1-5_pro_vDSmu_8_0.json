This presents two possibilities.\n* **Premise 2:**  We know the remote is NOT hiding under the couch. This eliminates one of the possibilities from Premise 1.\n* **Conclusion:** Therefore, the remote MUST be on the coffee table. This is the only remaining possibility.\n\nThis argument follows a structure called \"disjunctive syllogism.\"  Disjunctive syllogisms are valid because if one possibility is ruled out in a situation with only two options, the remaining option must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
