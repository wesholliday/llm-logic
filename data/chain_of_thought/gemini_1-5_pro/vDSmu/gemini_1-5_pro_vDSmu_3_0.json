This sets up two possibilities.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet. This eliminates one of the possibilities.\n* **Conclusion:** The keys are in the drawer.  Since one possibility was ruled out, this conclusion follows the remaining possibility.\n\nThis is a classic example of disjunctive syllogism, a valid argument form.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
