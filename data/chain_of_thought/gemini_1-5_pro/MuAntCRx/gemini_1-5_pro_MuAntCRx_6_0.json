The first statement tells us something that the fizzle must do under a specific condition (\"at zump wumble\"). The second statement introduces new actions (\"snizzle\" and \"shimble quazzle\") and tries to combine them with the original action. There's no information in the first statement to suggest that the fizzle must perform these additional actions or that they are in any way connected. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
