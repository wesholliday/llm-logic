There are no rules of inference or implication provided that would allow us to conclude that a \"grooble\" must \"snork wozzle grooble\" just because it \"must frazzle quibble wibble.\"  The words themselves are meaningless, and there's no context to suggest a relationship between \"frazzle quibble wibble\" and \"snork wozzle grooble.\"\n\nAnswer: no \n"
