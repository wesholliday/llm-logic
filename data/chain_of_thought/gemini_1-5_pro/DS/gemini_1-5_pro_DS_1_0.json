This means there are two possibilities, and one of them must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** Fido is not in the garden. This eliminates one of the possibilities from Premise 1. \n\nSince we know one possibility is false, and only one other possibility exists according to Premise 1, that other possibility must be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
