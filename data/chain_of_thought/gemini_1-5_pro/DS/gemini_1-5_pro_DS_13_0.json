This means there are two possibilities, and one of them MUST be true.\n* **Statement 2:** The toy isn't sitting on the shelf. This eliminates one of the possibilities from Statement 1. \n\nSince one possibility is eliminated and one of the possibilities MUST be true, the remaining possibility must be the correct one.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
