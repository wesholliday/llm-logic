This presents two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge. This tells us that the second possibility in Statement 1 is not necessarily true.\n\nSince at least one of the possibilities in Statement 1 must be true, and we know the second possibility isn't necessarily true, this means the first possibility must be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
