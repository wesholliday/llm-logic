This presents two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk. This eliminates one of the possibilities presented in Statement 1.\n\nSince one possibility has been ruled out, and we know at least one of the possibilities must be true, we can logically conclude that the remaining possibility is true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
