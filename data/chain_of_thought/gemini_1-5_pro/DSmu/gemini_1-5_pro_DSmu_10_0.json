This presents two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed. This eliminates one of the possibilities presented in Statement 1.\n\nSince we know at least one of the possibilities in Statement 1 must be true, and Statement 2 eliminates one of those possibilities, we are left with only one remaining option.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
