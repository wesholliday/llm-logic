Here's why we can't:\n\n* Statement 1 only tells us what happens *if* the dog was inside. It doesn't guarantee the dog *was* inside.\n* The cat being outside doesn't automatically mean the dog was the reason. There could be other reasons the cat was outside.\n\n**Example:** Imagine the cat loves being outside and is often found there.  Just because the cat is outside doesn't mean the dog forced it out.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
