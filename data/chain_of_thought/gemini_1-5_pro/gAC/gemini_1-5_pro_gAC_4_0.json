This is written symbolically as P \u2192 Q.\n* **We are also given that the second part of the conditional statement is true:** The robot visited Jupiter (Q).\n* **The question is:** Does this mean the first part of the conditional statement MUST be true? Does the alien visiting Mars (P) have to be true for the whole statement to be true?\n\nConsider this: What if the robot always visits Jupiter, regardless of whether the alien visits Mars? In that case, the robot visiting Jupiter doesn't tell us anything about the alien's whereabouts. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
