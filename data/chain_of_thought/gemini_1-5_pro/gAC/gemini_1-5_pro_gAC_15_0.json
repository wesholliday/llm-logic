Here's why:\n\n* **The original statement doesn't say Erin *only* takes the train if Sam takes a plane.**  Maybe Erin always takes the train, regardless of Sam's travel plans.\n\n**Example:** Imagine the rule is \"If it's raining, I'll carry an umbrella.\"  Just because I'm carrying an umbrella doesn't mean it *must* be raining \u2013 I might carry it even on sunny days!\n\nAnswer: no \n"
