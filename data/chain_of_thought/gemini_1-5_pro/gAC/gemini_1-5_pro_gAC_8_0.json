It doesn't say anything about what happens if the vampire is NOT awake. \n\n* **Example:** Maybe the mummy always wakes up first. The vampire could still be asleep, and the mummy could be awake.\n\n* **Therefore:** We can't definitively say the vampire was awake just because the mummy was.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
