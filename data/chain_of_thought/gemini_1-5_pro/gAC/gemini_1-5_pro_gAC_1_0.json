This is a conditional statement.\n    * Sue was at the wedding (S is true).\n\n* **The question is:** Does it automatically mean Mary was at the wedding (is M true)?\n\n* **Consider this:** The original statement only tells us what happens IF Mary was there. It doesn't say anything definitive about whether she actually was there or not. \n\n* **Example:**  Maybe Sue loves weddings and goes to all of them, regardless of who else is attending.  Just because Sue was there doesn't mean Mary had to be there too.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
