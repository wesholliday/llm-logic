The original statement only tells us what happens if the shirt *was* cotton. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the pants are denim for some other reason.\n\n**Example:**  Maybe the pants were denim because they were part of a denim-on-denim outfit, regardless of the shirt material.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
