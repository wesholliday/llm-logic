In other words, does Mark buying the blue shirt force Lisa to have bought the red shirt?\n\nConsider this:  Maybe Mark likes blue shirts and buys them all the time, regardless of what Lisa does. The original statement only tells us what happens if Lisa buys the red shirt; it doesn't say anything about what happens if she doesn't.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
