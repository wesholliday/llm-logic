The truck being metal doesn't depend on the doll being plastic. There could be other reasons the truck was metal.\n\n**Example:** Imagine the rule \"If it's raining, the ground is wet.\"  You're told \"The ground is wet.\"  Does that mean it's raining? Not necessarily.  The ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled something, etc.).\n\nAnswer: no \n"
