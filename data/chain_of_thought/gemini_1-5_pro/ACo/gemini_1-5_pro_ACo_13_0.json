However, it doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the car is *not* red.  The truck being blue doesn't automatically mean the car must be red. There could be other reasons the truck was blue.\n\n* **Example:** Maybe all trucks in that town are blue, regardless of the car's color.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
