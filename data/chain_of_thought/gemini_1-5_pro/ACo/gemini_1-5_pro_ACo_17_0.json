It doesn't tell us anything about whether he actually did. \n\n* **Example:** It's like saying \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\"  Just because the ground is wet, doesn't mean it *must* be raining (maybe someone sprayed a hose).\n\n* **Applying this to our problem:** Just because Kate ate salad doesn't mean Ben *must* have eaten pasta. There could be other reasons why Kate ate salad.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
