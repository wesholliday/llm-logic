However, it doesn't work in reverse. Just because Chris finished the race doesn't automatically mean Alex did too. There could be other scenarios where Chris finishes and Alex doesn't.\n\n**Example:** Imagine a race where everyone who finishes gets a medal, but some people don't finish. Chris getting a medal (finishing) doesn't mean Alex also got a medal (finished).\n\nAnswer: no \n"
