It doesn't have to be on the bookshelf.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\"**\n    * This gives us two possibilities, and one of them must be true.\n\nNow let's combine the information:\n\n* We know the toy doesn't *have* to be on the bookshelf (from Statement 1).\n* We know the toy is either in the toy box OR on the bookshelf (from Statement 2).\n\nSince the toy doesn't have to be on the bookshelf, and those are our only two options, the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
