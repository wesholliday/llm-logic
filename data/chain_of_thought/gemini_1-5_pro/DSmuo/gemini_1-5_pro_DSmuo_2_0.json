It could be somewhere else.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"** This gives us two possibilities, but Statement 1 eliminates one of them.\n\n* **Reasoning:** Since the book doesn't *have* to be on the table (from Statement 1), and Statement 2 says it's either on the shelf OR the table, the only remaining possibility is the shelf. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
