This means the jacket could be somewhere else, but it doesn't rule out the closet entirely.\n\n* **Statement 2:** Either the jacket is draped over the chair OR it must be hanging in the closet. This gives us two possibilities.\n\n* **Putting them together:**  Statement 1 weakens the \"must be hanging in the closet\" part of Statement 2. However, Statement 2 still leaves us with two options, and Statement 1 only eliminates the necessity of one option, not the possibility. \n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
