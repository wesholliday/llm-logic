He might be inside, or he might be somewhere else entirely.\n\n* **\"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\"**: This presents two possibilities, but it doesn't rule out Fido being in both places (if that were possible). \n\nConsidering both statements:\n\n* We know Fido doesn't *have* to be in the garden. \n* We know he's either inside or in the garden (or perhaps both).\n\nSince Fido could be somewhere else besides the garden, and the second statement allows for him to be inside, we can't definitively say he *is* inside. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
