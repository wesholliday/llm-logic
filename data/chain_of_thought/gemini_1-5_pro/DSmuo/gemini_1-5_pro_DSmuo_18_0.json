This means the notebook could be somewhere else.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand. This gives us two possibilities.\n\nSince Premise 1 tells us the notebook doesn't *have* to be on the nightstand, and Premise 2 gives us only two options, the only remaining possibility is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
