This means it's possible the sock is under the bed, but it's not the only option.\n\n* **Statement 2:** Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket *or* it must be under the bed. This presents two possibilities, but Statement 1 eliminates the \"must be under the bed\" option.\n\nSince the sock doesn't *have* to be under the bed, and the only other option presented is the laundry basket...\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
