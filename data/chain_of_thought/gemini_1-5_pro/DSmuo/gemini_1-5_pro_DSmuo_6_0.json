It could be ringing elsewhere, or not ringing at all.\n\n* **Statement 2: \"Either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen.\"** This presents two possibilities, but at least one MUST be true.\n\nNow let's combine the information:\n\n* We know from Statement 1 that the phone ringing in the kitchen isn't guaranteed. \n* Since Statement 2 says one of the options MUST be true, and we've ruled out the phone definitely ringing in the kitchen, the remaining option must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
