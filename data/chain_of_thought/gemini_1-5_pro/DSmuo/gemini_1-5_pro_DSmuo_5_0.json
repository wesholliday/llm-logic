This means the cookies could be somewhere else besides the pantry.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry. This gives us two possibilities.\n* **Putting them together:** Since Premise 1 tells us the cookies don't *have* to be in the pantry, and Premise 2 says they are either in the jar OR the pantry, it's possible the cookies are in the jar. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
