This means the remote *could* be somewhere else, but it doesn't have to be under the couch.\n\n* **Statement 2:** Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch. This presents two options, and at least one must be true.\n\n* **Putting them together:** Since Statement 1 tells us the remote doesn't *have* to be under the couch, and Statement 2 gives us only two options, the remaining option must be true. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
