This means the cat could be doing something else, like napping on the couch. \n* **Statement 2:** Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom. This gives us two possibilities.\n* **Putting them together:** Statement 1 tells us the cat doesn't *have* to be playing in the bedroom.  Statement 2 says those are the only two options. Since one option is ruled out, the other must be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
