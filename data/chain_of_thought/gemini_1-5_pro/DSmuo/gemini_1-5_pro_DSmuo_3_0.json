This means the keys could be somewhere else besides dangling in the cabinet.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet. This gives us two possibilities.\n* **Putting it together:** Since Premise 1 tells us the keys don't *have* to be in the cabinet, and Premise 2 gives us only two options (drawer or cabinet), the only remaining possibility is the drawer. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
