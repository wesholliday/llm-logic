This means the scarf could be somewhere else.\n* **Statement 2:** Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack. This gives us two possibilities.\n\nSince Statement 1 tells us the scarf doesn't *have* to be on the coat rack, and Statement 2 gives us only two options, the scarf being in the backpack becomes the remaining valid possibility. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
