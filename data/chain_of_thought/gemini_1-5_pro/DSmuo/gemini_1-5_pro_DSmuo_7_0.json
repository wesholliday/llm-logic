This means the umbrella could be somewhere else.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet. This gives us two possibilities.\n* **Reasoning:** Since Premise 1 tells us the umbrella doesn't *have* to be in the closet, and Premise 2 says it's either in the car or the closet, the only remaining possibility is that the umbrella is in the car. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
