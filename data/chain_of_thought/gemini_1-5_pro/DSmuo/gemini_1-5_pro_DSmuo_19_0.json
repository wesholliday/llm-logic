This means the watch could be somewhere else.\n* **Premise 2:** Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist. This gives us two possibilities.\n* **Conclusion:** The watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nSince Premise 1 tells us the watch doesn't *have* to be on his wrist, it could be on the dresser charging. Premise 2 gives us this as a possibility. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
