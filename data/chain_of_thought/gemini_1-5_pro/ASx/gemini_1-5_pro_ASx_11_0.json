The original statement doesn't say the glorp *won't* zoon if something else happens alongside the zibble being zapped.\n* **Analogy:** It's like saying \"If it rains, the ground gets wet\".  Adding \"If it rains and I'm wearing a hat, the ground gets wet\" doesn't change the fact that rain makes the ground wet, regardless of my hat.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
