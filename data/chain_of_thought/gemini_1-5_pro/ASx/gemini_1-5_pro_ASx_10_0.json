            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the klank is hooped, then the wuggy will zink. This sets up a conditional relationship where a hooped klank guarantees the wuggy will zink. \n* **New statement:** If the klank is hooped AND the wuggy is out of zloat, then the wuggy will zink. This adds an extra condition about the wuggy being \"out of zloat\".\n\nThe original statement tells us nothing about the importance of \"zloat\".  Even if the wuggy is IN zloat, a hooped klank should still make it zink according to the first statement.  \n\n**Answer:** Yes \n"
