We don't know what any of these actions or objects are, but that doesn't matter for this logic problem.\n\n* **Analyzing the New Statement:** The new statement adds an extra condition: \"and a wug zites\". This means something else needs to happen (\"a wug zites\") in addition to crinking the snoogle for us to plook a nurp.\n\n* **Can we make the inference?**  The original statement only tells us what happens when we crink the snoogle. It says nothing about what happens if something else (like \"a wug zites\") also occurs.  The new statement might be true, or it might not be, but we can't logically infer it from the first statement.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
