However, the original statement only tells us what happens when the frizzle is dinked. It says nothing about whether or not the zarp will splunk if something *else* (like the sklonk being grooped) happens.\n\n**Therefore, we cannot logically infer the new statement from the original.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
