We don't know if we actually WILL do that.\n* **The new statement adds a condition:** It throws in \"and the crungle is splooted\". This is completely unrelated to the original statement.\n* **Can we be sure about the bloop?** The original statement only links \"bringle the splotch\" to \"bloop will floosh\".  Adding extra conditions doesn't automatically guarantee the same outcome.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
