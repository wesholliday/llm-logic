This means twiddling is enough to make it pluzzle. \n* **New statement:** If the zonk is twiddled AND it is blorped, then it will pluzzle. This adds an extra condition (blorping).\n\nSince twiddling alone guarantees pluzzling, adding the extra condition of blorping doesn't change the outcome.  \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
