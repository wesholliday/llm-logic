There might be other conditions we don't know about.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine the original statement means \"If it's raining (glop on brink), then the ground is wet (skrizzle plonked).\"\n\nThe proposed inference would be like saying \"If it's raining (glop on brink) and I'm wearing a hat (bloop zorped), then the ground is wet (skrizzle plonked).\"  \n\nJust because I'm wearing a hat doesn't guarantee the ground is wet. There could be other factors.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
