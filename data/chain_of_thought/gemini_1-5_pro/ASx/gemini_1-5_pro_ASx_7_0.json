Does this extra condition change whether the goom is snurpled?\n\nNot necessarily. The original statement tells us the goom is snurpled whenever the tizzer is on. It doesn't say anything about the plink light.  The plink light could be on, off, flashing, or anything else \u2013 it doesn't affect the relationship between the tizzer and the goom.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
