The original statement tells us what happens if the glunk snarbles. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the troon is *also* zibbled. The blip could still be floinked regardless.\n\n**Analogy:**\n\nImagine this statement: \"If it rains (P), then the ground will be wet (Q).\" \n\nNow add a condition: \"If it rains (P) and I'm wearing a hat (R), then the ground will be wet (Q).\"\n\nMy wearing a hat doesn't change the fact that rain makes the ground wet.\n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
