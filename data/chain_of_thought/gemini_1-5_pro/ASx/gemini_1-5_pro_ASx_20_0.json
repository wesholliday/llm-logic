Does this extra condition affect whether the whiffle will sploosh? Not necessarily. The original statement tells us that the plim being grobbled is sufficient for the whiffle to sploosh.  It doesn't say anything about other factors.\n\n**Analogy:**\n\nImagine this: \"If it rains (P), then the ground will be wet (Q).\" Now consider: \"If it rains (P) and I'm wearing a hat (R), then the ground will be wet (Q).\"  My hat doesn't change the fact that rain makes the ground wet.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAdding an extra condition to the hypothesis doesn't invalidate the original implication.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
