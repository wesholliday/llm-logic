That doesn't matter; we're focused on the logic.\n\n* **The new statement adds information:**  It takes the original condition (\"krimp is in the zool\") and adds \"and the zool is zapped\". \n\n* **Does this added information change the outcome?**  Not necessarily. The original statement only tells us what happens when the krimp is in the zool. It says nothing about what happens if the zool is ALSO zapped. Maybe zapping the zool changes things, maybe it doesn't.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
