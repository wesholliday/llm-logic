This means at least one of the two options must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped. This eliminates one of the options presented in statement 1.\n\nSince one option is eliminated and at least one *must* be true, the remaining option must be the true one.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
