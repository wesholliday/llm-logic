This means at least one of the two options must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled. This tells us that \"the zinger must be smoogled\" is false. \n* **Reasoning:** Since one of the options in Statement 1 MUST be true, and we know \"the zinger must be smoogled\" is false, then the other option, \"the zinger is fraggled\" must be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
