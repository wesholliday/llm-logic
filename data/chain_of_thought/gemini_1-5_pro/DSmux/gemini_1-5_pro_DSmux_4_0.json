This presents two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked. This eliminates one of the possibilities presented in Statement 1.\n\nSince we know one of the possibilities must be true, and we've eliminated one possibility, we are left with only one remaining option.\n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
