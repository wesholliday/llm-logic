This is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two options must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the clug must be snugged. This negates the second part of our disjunction.\n* **Reasoning:** Since one part of the disjunction MUST be true (from Premise 1), and we know the second part is NOT true (from Premise 2), then the first part MUST be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
