This is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two options must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked. This negates the second part of our disjunction. \n* **Reasoning:** Since one part of the disjunction MUST be true, and we know the second part is NOT true, then the first part MUST be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
