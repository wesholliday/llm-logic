It could still be plagged, but it's not required.\n\n* **Conclusion:** The smonk is vreebled.\n\nNow let's see if the conclusion follows:\n\nSince the smonk being plagged isn't a necessity (from Statement 2), and one of the two options in Statement 1 MUST be true, the only remaining possibility is that the smonk is vreebled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
