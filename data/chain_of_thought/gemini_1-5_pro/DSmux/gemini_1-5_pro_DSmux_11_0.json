This means at least one of the two options must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed. This eliminates one of the options, meaning it's not necessary for the flug to be zimmed.\n\nSince one of the options had to be true, and we've eliminated \"the flug must be zimmed,\" the only remaining possibility is that \"the flug is blummed.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
