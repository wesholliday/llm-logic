One part, or the other, or even both could be true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled.\n    * This tells us that the second part of Statement 1 is false.\n\n* **Reasoning:** Since the second part of the \"or\" statement is false, the first part *must* be true to make the entire statement true.\n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
