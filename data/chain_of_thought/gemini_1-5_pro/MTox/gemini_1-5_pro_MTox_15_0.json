But Premise 1 tells us the dreb was NOT spened. This creates a contradiction. Therefore, Possibility 1 cannot be true.\n\n* **Possibility 2: The dreb was NOT vroombed.** This possibility aligns with both premises. It doesn't contradict the information given.\n\nSince Possibility 1 leads to a contradiction and Possibility 2 does not, we can logically conclude that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
