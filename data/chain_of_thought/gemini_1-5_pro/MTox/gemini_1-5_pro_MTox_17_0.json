Let's assume the opposite of our conclusion:\n\n* **Assumption:** The flob *was* skizzled.\n\nNow, according to Premise 2, if the flob was skizzled (our assumption), then the flob movated.  This directly contradicts Premise 1, which states the flob did *not* movate. \n\nBecause our assumption leads to a contradiction, our assumption must be false. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
