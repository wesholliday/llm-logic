Notice that Premise 2 sets up a conditional statement:\n\n* **If** the splat was morphed (hypothesis), **then** the splat quanked (conclusion).\n\nWe know from Premise 1 that the splat did *not* quank.  This means the \"conclusion\" part of our conditional statement is false.  \n\nTo keep the entire conditional statement from being false, the \"hypothesis\" part must also be false.  The \"hypothesis\" was \"the splat was morphed\".  Therefore, for the premises to be true, \"the splat was morphed\" must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
