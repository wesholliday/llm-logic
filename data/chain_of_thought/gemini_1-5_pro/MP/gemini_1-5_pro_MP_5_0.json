This sets up a conditional statement where Jeff playing basketball is the condition, and Amy playing tennis is the result.\n* **Premise 2:** Jeff played basketball. This tells us the condition from Premise 1 is met.\n\nSince the condition of the \"if, then\" statement is true, and we're told the statement itself is true, the result must also be true. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
