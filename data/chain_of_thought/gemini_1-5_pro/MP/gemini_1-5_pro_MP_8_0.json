This is a conditional statement, meaning it sets up a relationship where the mummy being awake depends on the vampire being awake.\n* **Premise 2:** The vampire was awake. This tells us the condition in our first statement is met.\n\nSince the vampire being awake guarantees the mummy is also awake (according to our first premise), we can confidently conclude the mummy was indeed awake.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
