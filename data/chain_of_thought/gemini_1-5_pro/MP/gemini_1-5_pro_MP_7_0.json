It tells us that Chris finishing the race is dependent on Alex finishing the race.\n* **Premise 2:** Alex finished the race. This confirms the condition set in Premise 1.\n\nSince Alex finishing the race guarantees Chris finishing the race (according to Premise 1), and we know Alex did finish the race, we can conclude that Chris also finished the race.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
