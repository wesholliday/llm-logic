It tells us that Sue being at the wedding is dependent on Mary being at the wedding.\n* **Premise 2:** Mary was at the wedding. This confirms the condition in our first premise is met.\n\nSince Mary being at the wedding guarantees Sue being at the wedding (according to Premise 1), and we know Mary was there (Premise 2), we can conclude that Sue was also there.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
