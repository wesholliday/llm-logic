This is a conditional statement, like saying \"If A, then B\".\n* **Statement 2:** The bear was in the cave. This confirms that \"A\" from our conditional statement is true.\n\nSince we know \"If A, then B\" is true, and we know \"A\" is true, we can logically conclude that \"B\" must also be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
