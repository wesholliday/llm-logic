It tells us that *if* the cake is chocolate, *then* the muffins must be blueberry. \n\n2. **We are given:** \"The muffins were blueberry\". This tells us the second part of the conditional statement is true.\n\n3. **The question:** Can we be certain that the cake was chocolate just because we know the muffins were blueberry? \n\n4. **Consider this:**  The original statement doesn't say that blueberry muffins *only* happen when there's a chocolate cake.  Maybe the muffins are always blueberry, regardless of the cake flavor.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
