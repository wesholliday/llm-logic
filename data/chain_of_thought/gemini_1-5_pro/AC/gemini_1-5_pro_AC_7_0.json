Notice that Statement 1 only tells us what happens if Alex finishes; it doesn't say anything about what happens if Alex *doesn't* finish.  It's possible Chris could finish even if Alex didn't.\n\n**Example:** Imagine Chris is a very fast runner. Even if Alex doesn't finish the race, Chris could still finish.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Alex finished the race.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
