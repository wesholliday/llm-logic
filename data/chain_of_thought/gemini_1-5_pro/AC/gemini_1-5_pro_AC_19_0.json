It doesn't mean Tom *always* watches football, just that *if* he does, then Jen watches basketball.\n* **Statement 2:** Jen watched basketball. This tells us a fact about Jen, but doesn't directly reveal anything about Tom.\n\nWe cannot definitively say whether Tom watched football. Jen watching basketball could be the result of Tom watching football, or it could be for entirely unrelated reasons. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
