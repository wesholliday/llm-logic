Here's why we can't:\n\n* **Statement 1 only tells us what happens if the shirt IS cotton.** It doesn't say anything about what happens if the shirt is NOT cotton. \n* **The pants being denim doesn't automatically mean the shirt MUST be cotton.**  Maybe the pants are always denim, regardless of the shirt material.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
