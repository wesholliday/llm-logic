It doesn't mean Sam *actually* took a plane, just that *if* he did, then Erin took a train.\n* **Statement 2:** Erin took a train. This tells us Erin definitely took a train.\n\nHere's the catch: just because Erin took a train doesn't automatically mean Sam took a plane.  Erin could take a train for many reasons, regardless of Sam's mode of transportation. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
