Consider this: Statement 1 only tells us what happens if the alien *did* visit Mars. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the alien *didn't* visit Mars.  Maybe the robot goes to Jupiter a lot!\n\nJust because the robot visited Jupiter doesn't mean the alien had to have visited Mars. There could be other reasons for the robot's trip.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
