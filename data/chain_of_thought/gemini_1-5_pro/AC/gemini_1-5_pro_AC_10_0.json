It doesn't claim the dog *was* inside, only that *if* it was, then the cat was outside.\n* **Statement 2:** The cat was outside. This tells us a fact, but it doesn't reveal anything about the dog's location.\n\nWe cannot assume the dog being inside is the *only* reason the cat would be outside.  The cat could be outside for many reasons, regardless of the dog's location.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
