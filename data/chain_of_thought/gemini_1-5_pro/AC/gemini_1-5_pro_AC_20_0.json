It doesn't tell us anything about the actual color of the apple or banana, just that *if* the apple is red, *then* the banana must be yellow.\n* **Statement 2:** The banana was yellow. This tells us the banana is indeed yellow, but it doesn't give us any information about the apple.\n\nEven though the banana being yellow aligns with the conditional statement, it doesn't mean the apple *must* be red. The banana could be yellow for other reasons.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
