This is a conditional statement, meaning it sets up a relationship where the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt) is the condition for the second part (Mark buying the blue shirt) to be true. \n* **Statement 2:** Mark bought the blue shirt. This tells us the second part of our conditional statement is true.\n\nHowever, knowing the second part of a conditional statement is true does NOT automatically mean the first part is true.  \n\n**Example:** If it's raining (condition), then the ground is wet (result).  Just because the ground is wet doesn't mean it MUST be raining (could be a sprinkler).\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively say Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
