It doesn't mean it's a *sufficient* condition.\n* **We're also given:** \"Bob chose pasta.\" \n* **The question is:** Can we be certain that Sue chose pizza just because we know Bob chose pasta?\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nEven though Bob choosing pasta is required for Sue to have chosen pizza, there might be other reasons why Bob chose pasta.  The given information doesn't tell us that Bob *only* chooses pasta if Sue chooses pizza.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
