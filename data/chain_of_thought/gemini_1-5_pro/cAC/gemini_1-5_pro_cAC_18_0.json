            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Statement 1:** If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This is a conditional statement. It doesn't say the doll *was* plastic, just that *if* it was, *then* the truck would be metal.\n* **Statement 2:** The truck was metal. This tells us a fact about the truck, but doesn't directly reveal anything about the doll.\n\nThe key here is that the first statement only works in one direction. Just because the truck was metal doesn't automatically mean the doll was plastic. There could be other reasons the truck was metal. \n\n**Answer:** no \n"
