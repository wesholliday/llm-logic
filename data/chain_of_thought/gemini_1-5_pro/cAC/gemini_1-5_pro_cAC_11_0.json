Here's why we can't be sure:\n\n* **Statement 1 only tells us what happens IF the cake was chocolate.** It doesn't say the muffins are ONLY blueberry if the cake is chocolate.  Maybe the muffins are always blueberry!\n* **Just because the muffins were blueberry doesn't prove the cake caused it.** There could be other reasons for blueberry muffins.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
