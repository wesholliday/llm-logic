It doesn't mean the dog *was* inside, just that *if* it was, *then* the cat was outside.\n* **Statement 2:** The cat was outside. This tells us a fact, but it doesn't automatically tell us anything about the dog's location.\n\nCould the cat be outside even if the dog wasn't inside? Yes, absolutely.  The first statement only tells us what happens *if* the dog is inside. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
