It doesn't mean Lisa *did* buy the red shirt, just that *if* she did, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n* **Statement 2:** Mark bought the blue shirt. This tells us the second part of our conditional statement is true. \n\nHowever, knowing the second part of a conditional statement is true doesn't tell us if the first part is true or not. \n\n**Example:** If it's raining (statement 1), then the ground is wet (statement 2).  If we know the ground is wet, it doesn't automatically mean it's raining. There could be other reasons.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt just because Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
