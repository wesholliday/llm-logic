This presents two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** The shoes might not be lined up by the door. This introduces uncertainty about one of the possibilities from Statement 1. \n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nSince Statement 2 casts doubt on the shoes being by the door, it makes the other possibility from Statement 1 more likely. However, Statement 2 doesn't completely rule out the shoes being by the door.  \n\n**Answer:** no \n"
