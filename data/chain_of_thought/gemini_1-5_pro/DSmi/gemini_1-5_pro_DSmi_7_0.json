This presents two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet. This introduces uncertainty about the second possibility in Statement 1. \n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nSince the second statement casts doubt on the umbrella being in the closet, it strengthens the possibility that the first part of Statement 1 is true. However, Statement 2 doesn't completely rule out the umbrella being in the closet.  It just says it \"might not be\" there.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
