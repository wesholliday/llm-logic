This presents two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** The missing sock might not be under the bed. This introduces uncertainty about the sock being under the bed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship between the statements:\n\n* Statement 1 says the sock MUST be in one of two places.\n* Statement 2 says one of those places is NOT guaranteed.\n\nThis means that while the sock might not be under the bed, the first statement still requires it to be in one of the two locations. \n\nTherefore, if it's not under the bed, it must be in the laundry basket.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
