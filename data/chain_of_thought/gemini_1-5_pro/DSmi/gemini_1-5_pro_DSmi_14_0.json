This presents two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** The milk might not be chilling in the fridge. This introduces uncertainty about one of the possibilities from Statement 1. \n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nSince Statement 2 only tells us it's *possible* the milk isn't in the fridge, it doesn't rule out the possibility that it IS in the fridge.  Therefore, we can't definitively say the milk is on the counter.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
