This presents two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** The watch might not be on his wrist. This introduces uncertainty about one of the possibilities in Statement 1. \n\nSince Statement 2 casts doubt on the possibility of the watch being on his wrist, it strengthens the likelihood of the other possibility presented in Statement 1. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
