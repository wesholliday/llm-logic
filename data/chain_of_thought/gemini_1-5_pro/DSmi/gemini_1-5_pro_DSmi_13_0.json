It doesn't rule out the possibility of the toy being on the bookshelf, but it does mean we can't be certain it is.\n* Since the toy might NOT be on the bookshelf (Statement 2), and at least one of the possibilities in Statement 1 MUST be true, the only remaining option is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
