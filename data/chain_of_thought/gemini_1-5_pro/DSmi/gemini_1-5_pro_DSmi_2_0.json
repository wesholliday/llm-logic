This presents two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** The book might not be resting on the table. This introduces uncertainty about the second possibility in Statement 1. \n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nSince Statement 2 casts doubt on the book being on the table, it weakens that possibility. However, Statement 1 insists that at least one of the possibilities must be true.  Therefore, if the book might not be on the table, the only remaining possibility to fulfill Statement 1 is that the book must be on the shelf.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
