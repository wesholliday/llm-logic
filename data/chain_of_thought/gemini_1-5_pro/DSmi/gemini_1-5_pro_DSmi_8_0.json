This presents two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** The remote control might not be hiding under the couch. This introduces uncertainty about the second possibility in Statement 1. \n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nSince Statement 2 casts doubt on the remote being under the couch, it *could* be on the coffee table. However, Statement 2 doesn't completely rule out the possibility of the remote being under the couch.  Therefore, we can't definitively say the remote *is* on the coffee table.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
