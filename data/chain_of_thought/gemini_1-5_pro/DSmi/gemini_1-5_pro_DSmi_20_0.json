This presents two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** The sunglasses might not be perched on her head. This introduces uncertainty about one of the possibilities from Statement 1. \n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nSince Statement 2 casts doubt on the sunglasses being on her head, it makes the other possibility from Statement 1 (sunglasses in the bag) more likely. However, Statement 2 doesn't completely rule out the sunglasses being on her head. It just says they \"might not\" be. \n\n**Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the sunglasses are in her bag.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
