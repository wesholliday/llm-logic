This presents two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** The pen might not be on my desk. This introduces uncertainty about the pen's location on the desk, meaning it's possible the pen isn't there.\n\nNow let's consider the inference:\n\n* **Inference:** The pen is in my bag.\n\nReasoning:\n\nSince Statement 2 casts doubt on the pen being on the desk, and Statement 1 requires at least one of the locations to be true, the pen being in the bag becomes the more likely option. However, Statement 2 doesn't definitively rule out the desk. It just says the pen *might not* be there.  There's still a chance it could be on the desk.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
