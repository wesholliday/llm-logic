It says at least one MUST be true.\n* **Statement 2** introduces uncertainty about the cat being in the bedroom. It doesn't rule out the bedroom entirely, but it weakens that possibility.\n\nSince the bedroom possibility is weakened, and at least one of the possibilities from Statement 1 MUST be true, this strengthens the likelihood of the cat being on the couch. \n\nHowever, it doesn't definitively confirm the cat IS on the couch. The cat could be somewhere else entirely!\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
