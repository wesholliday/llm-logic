This presents two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack. This introduces uncertainty about one of the possibilities in Statement 1. \n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nSince Statement 2 casts doubt on the scarf being on the coat rack, it strengthens the possibility that the other part of Statement 1 is true. If the scarf *might not* be on the coat rack, it becomes more likely that it *is* in the backpack.\n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
