It doesn't rule out the possibility of the notebook being on the nightstand, but it does mean we can't be certain about it.\n\nSince the notebook might not be on the nightstand (Statement 2), and Statement 1 requires at least one of the locations to be true, we are left with only one remaining possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
