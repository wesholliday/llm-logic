If we have a statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know \"P\" is true, then \"Q\" must also be true.\n\n* In our case, \"The whiffle was shanked\" is our \"P\".\n* \"The whiffle tinked\" is our \"Q\".\n\nSince we know both \"If P, then Q\" and \"P\" are true, we can conclude \"Q\" is true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
