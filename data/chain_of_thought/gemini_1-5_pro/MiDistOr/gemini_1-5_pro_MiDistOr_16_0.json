This means there are two possible scenarios: 1) the room is cleaned daily, or 2) the room is cleaned upon request. Rephrasing the sentence as \"The room might be cleaned daily or it might be cleaned upon request\" doesn't change the meaning. It still presents the same two possibilities. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
