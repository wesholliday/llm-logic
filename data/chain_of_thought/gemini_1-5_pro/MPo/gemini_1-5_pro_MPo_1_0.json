If we have a statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that \"P\" is true, then \"Q\" must also be true.\n\n* **P:** Mary was at the wedding (Premise 1 tells us this is true)\n* **Q:** Sue was at the wedding\n\nSince we know Mary was at the wedding (P is true), and Premise 2 tells us Sue being at the wedding follows from Mary being at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
