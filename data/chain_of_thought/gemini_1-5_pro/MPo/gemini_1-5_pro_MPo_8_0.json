If we have a statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know \"P\" is true, then \"Q\" must also be true.\n\n* **P:** The vampire was awake (Premise 1)\n* **Q:** The mummy was awake \n\nSince we know the vampire was awake (P), and Premise 2 tells us this means the mummy must also be awake (Q), we can infer the mummy was awake.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
