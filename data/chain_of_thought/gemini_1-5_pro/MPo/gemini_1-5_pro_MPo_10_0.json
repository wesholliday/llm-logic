If we have a statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know \"P\" is true, then \"Q\" must also be true.\n\n* **P:** The dog was inside (Premise 1 tells us this is true)\n* **Q:** The cat was outside\n\nSince we know the dog was inside (P), and Premise 2 tells us that IF the dog was inside THEN the cat was outside, we can conclude the cat was indeed outside.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
