Modus ponens states that if we know \"If P then Q\" is true, and we also know \"P\" is true, then \"Q\" must also be true.\n\n* **P:** The doll was plastic (Premise 1 tells us this is true)\n* **Q:** The truck was metal \n\nSince we know both \"If P then Q\" (Premise 2) and \"P\" (Premise 1) are true, we can conclude \"Q\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
