Statement 1 would then mean the unicorn *must* also be in the forest. \n* **Contradiction:**  But Statement 2 says the unicorn might *not* be in the forest. This creates a contradiction if we assume the griffin was in the forest.\n\n**Therefore, to avoid a contradiction, the griffin cannot be in the forest.**\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
