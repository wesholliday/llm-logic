However, it doesn't tell us anything definitive about whether Ben did or didn't eat pasta.\n* **Possibility 2: Kate did not eat salad.** Statement 2 allows for this.  Because of Statement 1, if Kate didn't eat salad, then Ben couldn't have eaten pasta. \n\nTherefore, since Kate might not have eaten salad, we know Ben couldn't have eaten pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
