He might have finished, or he might not have.\n* **Possibility 2: Chris did NOT finish the race.**  Statement 1 tells us that IF Alex finished, THEN Chris MUST have finished. Since Chris did NOT finish, this means Alex could NOT have finished. \n\n**Reasoning:** Because Chris might not have finished (Statement 2), and Statement 1 links Chris finishing to Alex finishing, we can conclude that Alex must not have finished.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
