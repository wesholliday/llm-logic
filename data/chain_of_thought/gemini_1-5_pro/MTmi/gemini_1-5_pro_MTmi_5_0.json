We can represent this as:  Jeff playing basketball  => Amy playing tennis.\n* **Statement 2:** Amy might not have played tennis. This tells us it's possible Amy didn't play.\n\nNow, if Amy *did* play tennis, it doesn't tell us anything definitive about Jeff. He might have played basketball, or he might not have. \n\nHowever, if Amy *didn't* play tennis (which Statement 2 allows for), then Statement 1 tells us Jeff couldn't have played basketball. If he had, Amy would have been required to play tennis as well.\n\nTherefore, because Amy might not have played tennis, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
