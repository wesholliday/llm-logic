The inverse of a statement flips both the hypothesis and conclusion and negates them. \n\nThe question is whether the inverse of a statement automatically follows logically from the original statement.  Consider a real-world example:\n\n* **Statement:** If it is raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q). \n* **Inverse:** If it is not raining (not P), then the ground is not wet (not Q).\n\nWe know the original statement is generally true. However, the inverse is not necessarily true. The ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled something, etc.).\n\nTherefore, the inverse of a statement does not always logically follow from the original statement.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
