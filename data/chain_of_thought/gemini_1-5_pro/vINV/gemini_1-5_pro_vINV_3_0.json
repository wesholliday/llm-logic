We can symbolize this as: If J then M (J \u2192 M)\n* **Conclusion:** If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel. We can symbolize this as: If not J then not M (~J \u2192 ~M)\n\nThe argument structure is:  J \u2192 M therefore ~J \u2192 ~M\n\nThis structure resembles a common fallacy called \"denying the antecedent.\"  Here's why it's fallacious:\n\n* **The premise only tells us what happens if James wrote the book.** It doesn't tell us anything about books *not* written by James. \n* **Other authors could write mystery novels too.**  Just because James didn't write it doesn't automatically mean it can't be a mystery.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
