Consider these possibilities:\n\n* **Scenario 1: Jeff played basketball, Amy played tennis.** This fits the premise. It doesn't contradict the conclusion.\n* **Scenario 2: Jeff played basketball, Amy didn't play tennis.** This contradicts the premise, so we can ignore it.\n* **Scenario 3: Jeff didn't play basketball, Amy didn't play tennis.** This fits the conclusion. It doesn't contradict the premise. \n* **Scenario 4: Jeff didn't play basketball, Amy played tennis.** This contradicts the conclusion, but it doesn't contradict the premise.\n\nSince we found a scenario (Scenario 4) where the premise is true, but the conclusion is false, the argument is not logically valid.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
