The converse of a statement switches the hypothesis and conclusion. \n\nLet's consider an example to see if this holds true:\n\n* **Original statement:** If it is raining, then the ground is wet. (This is generally true)\n* **Converse:** If the ground is wet, then it is raining. (This is not always true - the ground could be wet for other reasons).\n\nSince the converse of a statement is not always logically equivalent to the original statement, the argument form is not logically valid.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
