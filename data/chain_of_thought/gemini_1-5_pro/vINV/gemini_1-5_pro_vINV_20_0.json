It doesn't mean the apple *was* red, just that *if* it was, the banana was yellow.\n* **Conclusion:** If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow. This is also a conditional statement. It tries to flip the premise's logic.\n\nThe question is whether the conclusion *must* be true if the premise is true.  Here's why it doesn't:\n\n* **Counterexample:** Imagine the apple is green, and the banana is yellow. The premise holds true (if the apple *were* red, the banana *would still* be yellow). However, the conclusion is false in this scenario.\n\nSince we found a counterexample, the argument's form isn't logically valid.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
