            "content": "Let's break down this argument:\n\n* **Premise:** If Lisa bought the red shirt (Let's call this 'R'), then Mark bought the blue shirt (Let's call this 'B').  We can symbolize this as:  R \u2192 B\n* **Conclusion:** If Lisa did not buy the red shirt (\u00acR), then Mark did not buy the blue shirt (\u00acB). We can symbolize this as: \u00acR \u2192 \u00acB\n\nThe argument is claiming that if the premise (R \u2192 B) is true, then the conclusion (\u00acR \u2192 \u00acB) must also be true.\n\nNow, let's consider if this holds up logically.  The original premise only tells us what happens if Lisa *does* buy the red shirt. It doesn't say anything about what happens if she *doesn't* buy the red shirt.  Mark might still buy the blue shirt even if Lisa doesn't buy the red one.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
