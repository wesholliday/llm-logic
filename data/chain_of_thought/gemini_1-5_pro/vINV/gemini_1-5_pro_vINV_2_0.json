Here's why it's not logically valid:\n\n1. **The premise only tells us what happens if the griffin WAS in the forest.** It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the griffin was NOT in the forest. \n\n2. **The unicorn could be in the forest for other reasons.**  Just because the griffin wasn't there doesn't automatically mean the unicorn wasn't there too. \n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine the forest also has a magical spring. The premise only tells us that if the griffin is there, the unicorn is also there (maybe they both like the spring). But the unicorn might visit the spring even when the griffin isn't around.\n\n**Therefore, the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premise.**\n\nAnswer: no \n"
