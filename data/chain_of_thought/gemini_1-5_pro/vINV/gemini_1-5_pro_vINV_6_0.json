We can represent this as: P \u2192 Q\n* **Conclusion:** If Sue did not choose pizza (\u00acP), then Bob did not choose pasta (\u00acQ). We can represent this as: \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\n\nThe argument structure is trying to say that if the original statement (P \u2192 Q) is true, then the inverse (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ) is also automatically true.\n\nHowever, this isn't always the case. Consider these possibilities:\n\n* **Sue chose salad, Bob chose pasta.** This fits the conclusion (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ) but doesn't align with the premise (P \u2192 Q). \n\nThis example shows us that the conclusion doesn't have to be true just because the premise is true.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
