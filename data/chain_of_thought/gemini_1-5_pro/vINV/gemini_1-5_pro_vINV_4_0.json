It doesn't say anything about what happens if the alien *didn't* visit Mars. \n\n* **Could the conclusion be false even if the premise is true?**  Yes.  The robot could have visited Jupiter for other reasons, even if the alien never went to Mars.\n\n* **Example:** Imagine the robot was pre-programmed to visit Jupiter regardless of the alien's actions. The premise could still be true (if the alien went to Mars, the robot would indeed be on Jupiter), but the conclusion would be false (the robot would go to Jupiter even if the alien didn't go to Mars).\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
