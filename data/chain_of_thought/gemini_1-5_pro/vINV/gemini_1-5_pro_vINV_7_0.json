It tells us that Chris finishing the race depends on Alex finishing the race.\n* **Conclusion:** If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race. This is also a conditional statement. It suggests that Chris not finishing the race depends on Alex not finishing the race.\n\nThe question is whether the conclusion automatically follows from the premise.  To test for validity, we can consider if there's any scenario where the premise could be true, but the conclusion false.\n\nImagine this: Alex finished the race, but Chris did not. In this scenario, the premise holds true (because if Alex finished, Chris finishing is a possibility), but the conclusion is false (because Alex not finishing is not a prerequisite for Chris not finishing).\n\nSince we found a counterexample, the argument's form is not logically sound.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
