We can symbolize this as: If P, then Q.\n\n* **Conclusion:** If Tom did not watch football (not P), then Jen did not watch basketball (not Q).  We can symbolize this as: If not P, then not Q.\n\nThe argument structure is:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nTherefore, if not P, then not Q.\n\nThis structure resembles a common logical fallacy called \"denying the antecedent.\"  Here's why it's fallacious:\n\n* The premise only tells us what happens if Tom *did* watch football. It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if he *didn't* watch football. \n\n* Jen might watch basketball for other reasons entirely.  Just because Tom didn't watch football doesn't automatically mean Jen wouldn't watch basketball.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
