            "content": "Let's break down this argument:\n\n* **Premise:** If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.  We can symbolize this as:  P \u2192 Q (where P = Ben ate pasta, Q = Kate ate salad)\n* **Conclusion:** If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad. We can symbolize this as: ~P \u2192 ~Q (where ~ means \"not\")\n\nThe question is whether the conclusion *must* be true if the premise is true.  To test validity, we look for potential counterexamples.  Could there be a situation where the premise (P \u2192 Q) is true, but the conclusion (~P \u2192 ~Q) is false?\n\nYes.  Consider this scenario:\n\n* Ben did not eat pasta (~P is true).\n* Kate ate salad (Q is true).\n\nIn this scenario:\n\n* The premise (P \u2192 Q) is still true.  The premise only states what happens if Ben *did* eat pasta. It doesn't say anything about what happens if he didn't.\n* The conclusion (~P \u2192 ~Q) is false.  We have ~P and Q, which makes the implication false.\n\nSince we found a counterexample, the argument form is not logically valid.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
