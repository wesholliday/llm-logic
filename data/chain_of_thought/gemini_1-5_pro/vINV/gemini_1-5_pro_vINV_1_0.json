            "content": "Let's break down this argument:\n\n* **Premise:** If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This is a conditional statement, often written as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n* **Conclusion:** If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding. This is also a conditional statement, but it's structured as \"If not P, then not Q.\"\n\nThis argument structure is attempting to switch both the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement to their negatives.  This is NOT a logically equivalent statement. \n\n**Example to illustrate:**\n\nLet's say the premise is true: \"If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).\"  This doesn't mean that if it's not raining (not P), the ground can't be wet (not Q). There could be other reasons for the ground to be wet (e.g., sprinklers).\n\n**Therefore:**\n\nAnswer: no \n"
