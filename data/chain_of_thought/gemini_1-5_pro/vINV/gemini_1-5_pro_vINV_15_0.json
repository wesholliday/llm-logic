We can represent this as P \u2192 T.\n* **Conclusion:** If Sam did not take a plane (\u00acP), then Erin did not take a train (\u00acT). We can represent this as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acT.\n\nThe argument structure is trying to say that if the original statement (P \u2192 T) is true, then the inverse (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acT) must also be true.\n\nHowever, this isn't how logical implications work.  Consider this example:\n\n* **If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (T).** This is generally true.\n* **If it's not raining (\u00acP), then the ground is not wet (\u00acT).** This is not necessarily true. The ground could be wet for other reasons.\n\nTherefore, the argument form is not logically valid because the truth of the premise doesn't guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
