It doesn't mean the muffins are *always* blueberry, only that they are blueberry *if* the cake is chocolate.\n* **Statement 2:** The cake was not chocolate. This tells us the condition in the first statement is not met.\n\nSince the condition (chocolate cake) is not met, we have no information about the muffins. The first statement only tells us about the muffins when the cake *is* chocolate. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
