It doesn't mean Lucy *only* goes to the zoo if Joe goes to the park. She could go to the zoo for other reasons.\n* **Statement 2:** Joe did not go to the park. This tells us the condition in the first statement is false.\n\nSince the first statement only tells us what happens if Joe *does* go to the park, we can't conclude anything about Lucy's actions when Joe doesn't go to the park. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
