It doesn't mean Jen *always* watches basketball, only that she does *if* Tom watches football.\n* **Statement 2:** Tom did not watch football. This tells us the condition in Statement 1 is not met.\n\nSince the condition (Tom watching football) is not met, we have no information about whether Jen watched basketball or not. She might have, she might not have. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
