It doesn't mean the apple *was* red, just that *if* it were, then the banana would be yellow.\n* **Statement 2:** The apple was not red. This tells us the condition in the first statement is false.\n\nNow, here's the key: just because the condition of a conditional statement is false, it doesn't tell us anything about the truth of the outcome. \n\nConsider this example: \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\"  If I tell you it's not raining, does that mean the ground *must* be dry? No, there could be other reasons for the ground to be wet.\n\nSimilarly, just because the apple wasn't red doesn't automatically mean the banana wasn't yellow. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
