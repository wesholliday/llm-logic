It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if Alex *didn't* finish the race.\n* **Statement 2:** Alex did not finish the race. This tells us the condition in Statement 1 is not met.\n\nSince the first statement only applies *if* Alex finished the race, knowing Alex didn't finish doesn't tell us anything about whether Chris finished.  Chris could have finished or not finished, and it wouldn't contradict our given information.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
