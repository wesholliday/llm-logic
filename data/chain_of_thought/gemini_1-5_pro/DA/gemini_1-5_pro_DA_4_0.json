It doesn't mean the robot *always* visits Jupiter, just that it does *if* the alien visits Mars.\n* **Statement 2:** The alien did not visit Mars. This tells us the condition in Statement 1 is not met.\n\nSince the condition (alien visiting Mars) is not met, we have no information about whether the robot visited Jupiter. The robot could have visited Jupiter for other reasons, or not at all. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
