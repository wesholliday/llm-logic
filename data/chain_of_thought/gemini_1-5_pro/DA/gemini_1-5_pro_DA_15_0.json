It doesn't mean Erin *always* takes a train, just that she does *if* Sam takes a plane.\n* **Statement 2:** Sam did not take a plane. This tells us the condition in Statement 1 is not met.\n\nSince the condition (Sam taking a plane) is not met, we cannot conclude anything about whether Erin took a train or not.  She might have, or she might not have \u2013 it's not determined by the information given.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
