            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Statement 1:** If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This is a conditional statement. It doesn't mean Amy *only* plays tennis if Jeff plays basketball. It just means if Jeff DID play, we know Amy also did. \n\n* **Statement 2:** Jeff did not play basketball. This tells us the condition in the first statement is not met.\n\n* **The Question:** Can we conclude Amy did not play tennis?  Since the first statement only applies IF Jeff played basketball, knowing he didn't play doesn't tell us anything about whether Amy played tennis or not. She could have played tennis for other reasons, or not played at all.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
