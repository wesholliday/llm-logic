It doesn't mean Bob *always* chooses pasta, only that he does *if* Sue chooses pizza.\n* **Statement 2:** Sue did not choose pizza. This tells us the condition in Statement 1 is not met.\n\nSince the condition (Sue choosing pizza) is not met, Statement 1 tells us nothing about Bob's choice. He could have chosen pasta or something else entirely. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
