It doesn't mean the doll WAS plastic, just that IF it was, THEN the truck was metal.\n* **Statement 2:** The doll was not plastic. This tells us the initial condition of Statement 1 is false.\n\nNow, think about what happens to a conditional statement when the initial condition is false.  Does it tell us anything about the second part of the statement? No. The truck could be metal, or it could be made of something else entirely. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
