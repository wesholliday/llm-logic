It only tells us something if Mary was actually at the wedding. \n* **Statement 2:** Mary was not at the wedding. This tells us the condition in Statement 1 is not met.\n\nSince Mary wasn't at the wedding, Statement 1 doesn't give us any information about whether Sue was there or not.  We cannot conclude that Sue was also not at the wedding.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
