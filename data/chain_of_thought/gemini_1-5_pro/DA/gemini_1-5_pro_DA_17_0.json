It doesn't mean Kate *always* eats the salad, only that she does *if* Ben eats pasta.\n* **Statement 2:** Ben did not eat pasta. This tells us the condition in the first statement is not met.\n\nSince the condition (Ben eating pasta) is not met, we have no information about whether Kate ate the salad. She might have eaten it for other reasons, or not.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
