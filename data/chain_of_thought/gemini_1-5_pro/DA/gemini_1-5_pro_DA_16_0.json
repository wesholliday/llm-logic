            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Statement 1:** If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. This is a conditional statement, meaning it only guarantees the second part (pants were denim) IF the first part (shirt was cotton) is true.\n\n* **Statement 2:** The shirt was not cotton. This tells us the condition in the first statement is NOT met.\n\n* **The Question:** Can we infer \"The pants were not denim\"?  Since the condition in the first statement (shirt being cotton) is false, the statement itself doesn't tell us anything about the pants. The pants could be denim or not denim for other reasons.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
