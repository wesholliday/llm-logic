This is a conditional statement, meaning it only applies if the first part (the vampire being awake) is true.\n* **Statement 2:** The vampire was not awake. This tells us the condition in Statement 1 is not met.\n\nSince the vampire being awake is a requirement for the mummy being awake (according to Statement 1), and we know the vampire wasn't awake, we can conclude the mummy wasn't awake either.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
