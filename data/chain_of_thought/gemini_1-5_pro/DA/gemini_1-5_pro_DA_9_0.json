It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if Lisa *didn't* buy the red shirt.\n* **Statement 2:** Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This tells us the condition in Statement 1 is not met.\n\nSince the condition of Statement 1 is not met, we cannot conclude anything about whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not.  He might have bought it for another reason, or he might not have.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
