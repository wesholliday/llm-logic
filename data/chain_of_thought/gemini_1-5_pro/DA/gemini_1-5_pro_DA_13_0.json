It doesn't mean the truck is *always* blue, just that it's blue *if* the car is red.\n* **Statement 2:** The car was not red. This tells us the condition in the first statement is false.\n\nNow, if the condition of a conditional statement is false, we **cannot** automatically conclude anything about the truth of the second part. \n\n**Example:** \n\nImagine the rule \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\" Now, if someone says \"It's not raining,\" does that mean the ground *must* be dry? No, there could be other reasons for the ground to be wet.\n\nSimilarly, just because the car wasn't red doesn't tell us anything definitive about the truck's color.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
