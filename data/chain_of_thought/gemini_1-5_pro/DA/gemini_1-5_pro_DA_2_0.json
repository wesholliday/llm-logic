It doesn't mean the unicorn is *always* in the forest, just that it is *whenever* the griffin is.\n* **Statement 2:** The griffin was not in the forest. This tells us the condition in Statement 1 is not met.\n\nSince the condition (griffin in the forest) is not met, we cannot conclude anything about the unicorn's location. The unicorn could be in the forest or not, the first statement doesn't apply.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
