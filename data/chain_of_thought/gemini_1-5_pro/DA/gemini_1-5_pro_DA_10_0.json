It doesn't mean the dog is actually inside, just that *if* it were, *then* the cat would be outside.\n* **Statement 2:** The dog was not inside. This tells us the condition in Statement 1 is not met. \n\nSince the condition of the dog being inside is not met, we can't conclude anything about the cat's location. The cat could be inside or outside.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
