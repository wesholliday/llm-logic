(This is our conditional statement)\n    * The truck was blue.\n\n* **We want to know:** Does this mean the car *must* have been red?\n\n* **Consider this:** The original statement only tells us what happens if the car IS red. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the car is NOT red.  Maybe the truck is always blue, regardless of the car's color.\n\n* **Example:** Imagine the rule \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\"  We know the ground is wet. Does that mean it MUST be raining? No, the ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled something, etc.).\n\nAnswer: no \n"
