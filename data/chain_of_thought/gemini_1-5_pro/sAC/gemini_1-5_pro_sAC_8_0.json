(Let's call this statement A \u2192 B)\n    * The mummy was awake. (Let's call this statement B)\n\n* **We want to know:** Does it follow that the vampire was awake? (Is statement A true?)\n\n* **Consider this:** Just because the mummy was awake (B is true), it doesn't necessarily mean the vampire being awake (A) was the *only* reason for it.  The mummy could have been awake for other reasons. \n\n* **Example:**  Maybe a loud noise woke the mummy up, regardless of whether the vampire was awake or not.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
