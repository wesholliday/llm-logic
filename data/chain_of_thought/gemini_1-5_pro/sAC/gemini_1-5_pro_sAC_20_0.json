It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the apple is NOT red. \n\n* **Example:**  The banana could be yellow even if the apple is green. Statement A doesn't rule that out.\n\n* **Therefore:** We can't definitively say the apple was red just because the banana was yellow.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
