Here's why:\n\n* **The original statement doesn't say blueberry muffins ONLY happen if there's a chocolate cake.**  Maybe they always have blueberry muffins, regardless of the cake type.\n\n**Example:**  Think of it like this: \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\"  Just because the ground is wet doesn't mean it MUST be raining \u2013 someone could be watering their lawn.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
