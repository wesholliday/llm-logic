(This is a conditional statement)\n    * The unicorn was in the forest.\n\n* **We want to know:** Does this mean the griffin was in the forest?\n\n* **Consider this:** Just because the unicorn being in the forest is *necessary* for the griffin to be in the forest (according to the conditional statement), it doesn't mean it's *sufficient*.  The griffin could be elsewhere even if the unicorn is in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
