This is a conditional statement.\n    * Erin took a train (T).\n\n* **The question is:** Does this mean Sam MUST have taken a plane (P)?\n\n* **Consider this:** The original statement only tells us what happens if Sam takes a plane. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Sam *didn't* take a plane.  Erin still could have taken a train even if Sam took a car, a bus, or rode a bike.\n\n* **Therefore:** We can't definitively say Sam took a plane just because Erin took a train.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
