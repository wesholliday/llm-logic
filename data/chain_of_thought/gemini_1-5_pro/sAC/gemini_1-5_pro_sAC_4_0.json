This is written symbolically as P \u2192 Q.\n* **We're also given that the second part of the conditional is true:** The robot visited Jupiter (Q).\n* **The question is:** Does this mean the first part of the conditional MUST be true?  In other words, does the robot visiting Jupiter force the alien to have visited Mars?\n\nConsider this: The original statement doesn't say anything about what happens if the robot visited Jupiter WITHOUT the alien visiting Mars. It only tells us what happens IF the alien visited Mars. \n\n**Answer:** no \n"
