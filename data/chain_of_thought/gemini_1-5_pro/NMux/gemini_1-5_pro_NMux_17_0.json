There could have been other situations.\n* **\"The flob MIGHT NOT have been skizzled\"**  means it's possible the flob wasn't skizzled. \n\nSince the first statement allows for other possibilities besides the flob being skizzled, it means the flob might not have been skizzled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
