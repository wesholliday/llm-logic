There's room for it not to have happened. \n* **\"The grommet might not have been sploffed\"**  means there's a possibility the grommet wasn't sploffed.\n\nSince the first statement allows for the possibility of the grommet not being sploffed, the second statement logically follows.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
