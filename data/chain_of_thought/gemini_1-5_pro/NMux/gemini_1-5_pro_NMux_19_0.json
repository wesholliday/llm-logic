It doesn't mean it definitely wasn't vreebled, just that it wasn't mandatory.\n\n* **\"The smonk MIGHT NOT have been vreebled\"**  expresses that same possibility - that vreebling the smonk wasn't a certainty.\n\nSince both statements convey the same possibility, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
