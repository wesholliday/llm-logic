There's no certainty they were.\n* **\"The twonk might not have been plinked\"** expresses that same possibility - that plinking the twonk wasn't guaranteed.\n\nSince both statements revolve around the same possibility (that the twonk wasn't plinked), they are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
