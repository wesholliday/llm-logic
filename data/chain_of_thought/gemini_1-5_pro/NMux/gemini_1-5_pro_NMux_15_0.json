There's room for the possibility that it wasn't.\n* **\"The dreb might not have been vroombed\"**  suggests that there's a possibility the dreb wasn't vroombed. \n\nSince the first statement allows for the possibility of the dreb not being vroombed, the second statement logically follows.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
