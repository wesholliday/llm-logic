There's room for the possibility that it wasn't flooped.\n\n* **\"The wug might not have been flooped\"** suggests that it's possible the wug wasn't flooped.\n\nSince the first statement opens up the possibility of the wug not being flooped, the second statement aligns with that possibility. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
