This is generally true.\n* **Converse:** If the ground is wet (Q), then it is raining (P). This is not always true, the ground could be wet for other reasons.\n\n**Applying this to our problem:** We cannot logically infer that if the flugel was zargled, then it was blimmed, even though the original statement might be true.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
