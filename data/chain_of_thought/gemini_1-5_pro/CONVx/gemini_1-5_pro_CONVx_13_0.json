We're dealing with the logic of the statement, not the meaning of the words.\n\n* **Think of it like a math equation.**  Let's replace the words:\n    * \"glip\" = X\n    * \"slogged\" = Y\n    * \"tragged\" = Z\n\n* **Now the original statement is:** If X was Y, then X was Z.\n\n* **We're asked if we can infer this:** If X was Z, then X was Y.\n\n* **This is like flipping the equation.**  Just because X being Y means X is also Z,  does *not* mean that X being Z means X was also Y. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
