We're focused on the structure of the statements.\n\n* **The first statement is in the form \"If P, then Q\".**  \"P\" is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and \"Q\" is \"the dreb was spened\".\n\n* **The second statement is in the form \"If Q, then P\".** This is the reverse of the first statement.\n\n* **In logic, reversing an \"If P, then Q\" statement does not necessarily hold true.**  For example, \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet\" is true. But \"If the ground is wet, then it's raining\" is not necessarily true (the ground could be wet for other reasons).\n\nAnswer: no \n"
