This sets up a conditional relationship where morphing leads to quanking.\n\n* **Question:**  If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed. This is asking if the reverse of the original statement is also true.\n\n* **Reasoning:** Just because morphing leads to quanking doesn't mean quanking *must* be caused by morphing.  There could be other reasons why a splat might quank. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
