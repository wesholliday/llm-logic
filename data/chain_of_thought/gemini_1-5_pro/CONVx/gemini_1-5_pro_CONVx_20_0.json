We're dealing with the structure of the statement, not the specific words.\n\n* **Think of it like this:** \"If A, then B\".  The question is asking if we can flip it to say \"If B, then A\".\n\n* **Example:** \"If it rained, then the ground is wet.\"  We can't flip this around and say \"If the ground is wet, then it rained.\" The ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled something, etc.).\n\n* **So, in our fleeg example:** Just because a fleeg surned doesn't mean the *only* reason it surned was that it was bluttered. There could be other reasons.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
