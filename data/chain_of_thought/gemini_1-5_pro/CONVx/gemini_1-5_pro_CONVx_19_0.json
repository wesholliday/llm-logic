This is generally true. However, if the ground is wet (B), it doesn't necessarily mean it's raining (A) \u2013 it could be due to sprinklers.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was vreebled' just because we know 'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged'.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
