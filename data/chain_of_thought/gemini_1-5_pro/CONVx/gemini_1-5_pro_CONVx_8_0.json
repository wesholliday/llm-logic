            "content": "Let's break down this logic problem:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled. This is a conditional statement, where \"cranked\" is the sufficient condition for \"daggled\". \n* **Question:** Can we infer \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was cranked\"? This is asking if the reverse of the original statement is also true.\n\n**Reasoning:** Just because cranking leads to daggling doesn't mean daggling always implies cranking. There could be other ways a sprocket gets daggled.\n\n**Example:** Imagine \"daggled\" means \"dirty\".  Cranking the sprocket might make it dirty, but the sprocket could also get dirty in other ways (like from dust).\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
