This means we have to rely entirely on the logical structure of the statements.\n\n* **The first statement sets up a conditional relationship.** It's saying IF something happened (the wug was flooped), THEN something else happened (the wug bimmed the zoint).\n\n* **The second statement reverses the order of events.** It's asking if the SECOND event (bimming the zoint) means the FIRST event (being flooped) MUST have happened.\n\n* **This is like assuming cause and effect just from the order of events.** Just because B happens after A doesn't mean A caused B. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
