We're dealing with the structure of the argument, not the specific words.\n\n* **Think of it like this:**  \"If A, then B\".  Can we infer \"If B, then A\"?\n\n* **Example:** \"If it's raining (A), then the ground is wet (B)\".  Does it follow that \"If the ground is wet (B), then it's raining (A)\"? No! The ground could be wet for other reasons.\n\n* **Therefore, we cannot automatically reverse the order of an \"if, then\" statement and assume it's still true.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
