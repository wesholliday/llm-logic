This sets up a conditional situation.  \n* **Question:** Can we infer that if I finish my homework AND my computer catches on fire, I can play video games? This adds an extra condition.\n\n**Reasoning:** The original statement only guarantees I can play video games IF I finish my homework. It says nothing about what happens if something ELSE also occurs, like a fire.  A fire would likely prevent me from playing video games, even if I did my homework.\n\n**Answer: No** \n"
