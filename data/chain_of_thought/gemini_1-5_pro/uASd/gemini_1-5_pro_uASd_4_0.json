It doesn't mean the dog is *always* barking when in the yard, just that *if* it's in the yard, *then* it's barking.\n* **The question:** Can we infer that if the dog is in the yard and asleep, then it is barking? This introduces a new condition: the dog is asleep. \n* **The conflict:**  The original statement doesn't tell us what a sleeping dog in the yard does. It only tells us what a dog in the yard does in general. \n\n**Answer: No** \n"
