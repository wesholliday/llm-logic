This statement sets up exercise as a potential cause for weight loss. \n* **Question:** Can we infer that if I exercise AND eat junk food, I will lose weight? This introduces a second factor: eating junk food.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* Weight loss is a complex process influenced by many factors, including calorie intake and expenditure.\n* Exercise generally increases calorie expenditure.\n* Eating junk food generally increases calorie intake.\n* The statement only addresses exercise, not the combined effect of exercise and diet.\n\n**Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether the combination of exercise and eating junk food will lead to weight loss.**\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
