The new statement introduces a new property, \"grazzle,\" and suggests that a quazzle must be either on grazzle or gribble.  Since the original statement doesn't tell us anything about \"grazzle,\" we can't make this inference.  It's possible for something to be gribble without being on grazzle. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
