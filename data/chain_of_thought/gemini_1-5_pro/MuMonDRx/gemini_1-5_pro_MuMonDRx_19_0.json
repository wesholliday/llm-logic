The question asks if we can infer that \"The grooble must be in grazzle OR blimp zibble.\" This statement introduces an alternative: the grooble could be in \"grazzle\" *instead* of being \"blimp zibble.\" Since the original statement doesn't allow for alternatives, we cannot make this inference. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
