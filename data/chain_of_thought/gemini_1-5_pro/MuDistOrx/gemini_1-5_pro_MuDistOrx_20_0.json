This means it has to do one of those two things, but it doesn't necessarily have to be one *or the other*. The second statement says the flim must quazzle a frazzle *or* it must quazzle a glorp. This implies that it could do either one individually. Since the original statement doesn't rule out the possibility of the flim quizzling both a frazzle and a glorp, the second statement is a valid inference. \nAnswer: yes \n"
