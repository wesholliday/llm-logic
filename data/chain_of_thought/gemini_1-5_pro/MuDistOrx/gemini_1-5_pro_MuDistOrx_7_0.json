This is inclusive, meaning the blimple could potentially be BOTH zump and zibber. The second statement changes the conjunction to \"or it must be zibber.\" This phrasing emphasizes the two options as separate, but it doesn't fundamentally change the meaning. It still allows for the possibility of the blimple being both zump and zibber. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
