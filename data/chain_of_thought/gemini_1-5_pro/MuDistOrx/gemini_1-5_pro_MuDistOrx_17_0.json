This adds the word \"it\" and changes \"be\" to \"must be\".  \n\n* The addition of \"it\" doesn't change the meaning, it just clarifies that we're still talking about the floob. \n* Changing \"be\" to \"must be\" doesn't change the fundamental meaning either. The original statement implies necessity due to the use of \"must\" earlier in the sentence.\n\nTherefore, the rephrased statement conveys the same logical meaning as the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
