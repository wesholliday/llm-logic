The original statement says the crunk might be wump in one of two situations: with snork or on a bimboozle snorkel.  Since the statement says the crunk might be wump with snork, we know that is a possibility. The fact that it also might be wump on a bimboozle snorkel doesn't negate the first possibility. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
