It doesn't tell us anything about the actual color of the apple or banana, just that *if* the apple was red, *then* the banana must have been yellow.\n\n* **Conclusion:** If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red. This is trying to reverse the premise. \n\n* **Logical Validity:**  An argument is logically valid if the conclusion must be true whenever the premise is true.  \n\nConsider this: What if the banana was yellow, but the apple was green? The premise would still hold true (it doesn't say anything about what happens if the apple *isn't* red), but the conclusion would be false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because we found a scenario where the premise could be true, but the conclusion could be false.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
