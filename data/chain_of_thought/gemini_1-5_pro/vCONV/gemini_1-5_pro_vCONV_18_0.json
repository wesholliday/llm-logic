            "content": "Let's break down this argument:\n\n* **Premise:** If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.  We can symbolize this as:  If P, then Q.\n* **Conclusion:** If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic. We can symbolize this as: If Q, then P.\n\nThis argument structure is attempting to reverse the premise to reach the conclusion.  However, just because the premise might be true, it doesn't mean the reverse is automatically true. \n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's say the original premise IS true:  If a toy is a doll (P), then it's made of plastic (Q).  This doesn't mean that EVERYTHING made of plastic (Q) is automatically a doll (P). There could be plastic trucks, plastic dinosaurs, etc.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the truth of the premise doesn't guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
