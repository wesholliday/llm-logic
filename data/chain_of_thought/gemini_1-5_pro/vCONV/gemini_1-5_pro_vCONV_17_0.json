This is a conditional statement where Ben eating pasta is the hypothesis and Kate eating salad is the conclusion.\n* **Conclusion:** If Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta. This is also a conditional statement, but the hypothesis and conclusion are flipped from the premise.\n\nThis argument structure is attempting to switch the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement.  This is not logically valid. \n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine Ben ate pasta, but Kate had steak instead of salad. The premise would still be true (because it doesn't say Kate *always* eats salad when Ben eats pasta, just that she did in this instance). However, the conclusion would be false because we know Kate didn't eat salad.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
