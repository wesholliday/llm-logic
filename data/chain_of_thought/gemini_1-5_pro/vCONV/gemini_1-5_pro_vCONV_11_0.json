This sets up a conditional relationship. \n* **Conclusion:** If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate. This tries to reverse the conditional relationship from the premise.\n\nThe question is whether the conclusion *must* be true if the premise is true.  Consider this: What if the muffins were blueberry for a reason completely unrelated to the cake? The premise doesn't say that the muffins are *only* blueberry if the cake is chocolate. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
