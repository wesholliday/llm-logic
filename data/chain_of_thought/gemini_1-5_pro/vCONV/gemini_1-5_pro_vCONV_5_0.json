Just because the premise might be true, it doesn't mean the reverse is automatically true. \n\nFor example, maybe Amy always plays tennis, regardless of whether Jeff plays basketball. In that case, the premise could be true (if Jeff plays, Amy definitely plays), but the conclusion could be false (Amy playing doesn't mean Jeff did).\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
