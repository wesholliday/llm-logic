            "content": "Let's break down this argument:\n\n* **Premise:** If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This is a conditional statement. It doesn't mean Mary WAS at the wedding, just that IF she was, THEN Sue was too.\n* **Conclusion:** If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding. This flips the premise around. \n\nThe key here is that conditional statements don't automatically work in reverse. Just because Sue being at the wedding might mean Mary was ALSO there, it doesn't mean Sue being there GUARANTEES Mary was there. \n\nFor example, maybe Sue goes to all the weddings, but Mary is more selective.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
