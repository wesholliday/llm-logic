This is not necessarily the case.\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's say P = It rained and Q = The ground is wet.\n\n* **Premise (true):** If it rained (P), then the ground is wet (Q).\n* **Conclusion (not necessarily true):** If the ground is wet (Q), then it rained (P). \n\nThe ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled something, etc.).\n\nTherefore, switching the order of the premise does not guarantee the conclusion is true.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
