We can represent this as P \u2192 T.\n* **Conclusion:** If Erin took a train (T), then Sam took a plane (P). We can represent this as T \u2192 P.\n\nThe argument is asking if the truth of the premise (P \u2192 T) guarantees the truth of the conclusion (T \u2192 P).\n\nConsider this: What if Erin takes the train for reasons unrelated to Sam's mode of transportation? The premise doesn't say Sam taking a plane is the *only* reason Erin would take a train. \n\nTherefore, even if the premise is true, the conclusion might not be.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
