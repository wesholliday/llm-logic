We can represent this as: If A, then B.\n\n* **Conclusion:** If Mark bought the blue shirt (B), then Lisa bought the red shirt (A). We can represent this as: If B, then A.\n\nThe argument is trying to say that if A implies B, then B also implies A. This is the structure of the converse in logic.\n\nHowever, the converse of a statement is not always logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nFor example, consider this:\n\n* **Original statement:** If it is raining (A), then the ground is wet (B). \n\n* **Converse:** If the ground is wet (B), then it is raining (A).\n\nThe original statement is generally true. But the converse isn't always true. The ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, someone spilled something, etc.).\n\nTherefore, just because a premise states \"If A, then B\", it doesn't necessarily follow that \"If B, then A\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
