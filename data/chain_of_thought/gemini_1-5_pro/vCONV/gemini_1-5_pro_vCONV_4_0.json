This is a conditional statement where visiting Mars is the hypothesis and visiting Jupiter is the conclusion.\n* **Conclusion:** If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars. This is also a conditional statement, but the hypothesis and conclusion from the premise are flipped.\n\nThis argument structure is attempting to say that if A implies B, then B implies A. This is not logically sound.  Just because one event happening might lead to another event, it doesn't mean the second event happening means the first one did too.\n\n**Example:** If it's raining (A), then the ground is wet (B). This is true. But if the ground is wet (B), it doesn't necessarily mean it's raining (A) - it could be due to sprinklers.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
