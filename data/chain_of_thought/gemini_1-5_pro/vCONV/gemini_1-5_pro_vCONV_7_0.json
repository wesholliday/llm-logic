Just because one thing implies another, doesn't mean the reverse is true.\n\nFor example, consider this:\n\n* **Premise:** If it's raining, then the ground is wet. (This is generally true)\n* **Conclusion:** If the ground is wet, then it's raining. (Not necessarily true - the ground could be wet for other reasons).\n\nTherefore, the argument form is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
