We can represent this as P \u2192 Q.\n* **Conclusion:** If Lucy went to the zoo (Q), then Joe went to the park (P). We can represent this as Q \u2192 P.\n\nThe argument is asking if P \u2192 Q guarantees that Q \u2192 P.  This is the structure of the converse in logic.\n\nThe converse is not always true.  \n\n**Example:**\n* If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q). This is generally true (P \u2192 Q).\n* If the ground is wet (Q), then it's raining (P). This is not always true \u2013 the sprinklers could be on (Q doesn't guarantee P).\n\n**Therefore, the form of argument presented is not logically valid.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
