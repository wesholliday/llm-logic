This is a conditional statement, where the car being red is the hypothesis and the truck being blue is the conclusion.\n\n* **Conclusion:** If the truck was blue, then the car was red. This is also a conditional statement, but notice that the hypothesis and conclusion from the premise are flipped.\n\nThis argument structure is attempting to say that if the original statement (premise) is true, then the reverse of that statement (conclusion) must also be true. \n\nHowever, this isn't always the case. Just because a car being red might mean a truck is blue, it doesn't automatically mean that a blue truck means the car must be red. There could be other reasons for the truck to be blue.\n\nTherefore, this argument form is not logically valid because the truth of the premise doesn't guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
