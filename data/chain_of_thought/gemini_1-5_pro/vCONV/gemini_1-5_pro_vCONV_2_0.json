Just because P might lead to Q, doesn't automatically mean that Q must lead to P. \n\nFor example, consider this:\n\n* If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).  This is generally true.\n* If the ground is wet (Q), then it's raining (P). This isn't always true \u2013 the sprinklers could be on.\n\nTherefore, switching the order of the premise and conclusion doesn't hold up logically.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
