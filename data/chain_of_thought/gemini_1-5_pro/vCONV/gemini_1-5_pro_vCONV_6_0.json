This is a conditional statement where Sue choosing pizza is the *hypothesis* and Bob choosing pasta is the *conclusion*.\n\n* **Conclusion:** If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza. This is also a conditional statement, but notice that the hypothesis and conclusion from the premise are now flipped.\n\nWe need to determine if the conclusion *must* be true whenever the premise is true.  Consider this: the premise doesn't say anything about what happens if Sue *didn't* choose pizza. Maybe Bob still chose pasta for some other reason! \n\nTherefore, even if the premise is true, the conclusion might not be.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
