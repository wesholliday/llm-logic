The question asks if we can infer the floob might be at that location *and* another location (\"the quibble glorp\") at the same time.  We don't know if the floob can be in two places at once, and the original statement doesn't say it's impossible. Therefore, while we don't know for sure if the floob *is* in both places, it's possible. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
