    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fraglen, a darpil, and a votal are the top bispil teams this season. The fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, while the votal trails far behind. These lead the league, so if the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn\u2019t, the votal will. Moreover, the fraglen likely will lead the league and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fraglen doesn\u2019t lead the league, the votal will?",

Premise 1 tells us this is true *only* if the darpil *also* doesn't lead.  While premise 3 suggests the darpil likely won't lead, it doesn't guarantee it.  \n\n**Therefore, we can't definitively say the votal is likely to lead if the fraglen doesn't.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
