    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trendel, a laxum, and a doffen are candidates for Best Ploggel at the National Zorple Championship. Handlers consider the trendel the frontrunner for Best Ploggel, followed by the laxum, while the doffen is a long shot to win. Since these are the only contenders, if the laxum doesn\u2019t win Best Ploggel, then if the trendel doesn\u2019t win, the doffen will win. Moreover, the trendel likely will win Best Ploggel and hence the laxum likely won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trendel doesn\u2019t win Best Ploggel, the doffen will?",

            "content": "Okay, let's break this down:\n\n* **We're trying to figure out if this statement is likely:** If the trendel doesn't win, the doffen will.\n* **We know this:** If the laxum doesn't win, AND the trendel doesn't win, THEN the doffen will win. This is because there are only three contenders.\n* **We also know this:** The trendel is likely to win. This implies the trendel is UNlikely to lose.\n\nNow here's the crucial part: Just because the trendel is likely to win doesn't automatically mean the statement \"If the trendel doesn't win, the doffen will\" is also likely.  \n\nWhy? Because for the doffen to win, TWO things have to happen: the trendel has to lose, AND the laxum has to lose.  While the trendel losing is one part of that, it's not a guarantee the doffen will win. The laxum could still win.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
