    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantug, a loperit, and a frallon are shortlisted for Blither of the Year. Industry watchers consider the fantug the front runner, followed by the loperit, while the frallon is a heavy underdog. Since these are the only products in contention, if the loperit doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the fantug doesn\u2019t win, the frallon will win. Moreover, the fantug likely will win the award and hence the loperit likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantug doesn't win Blither of the Year, the frallon will?",

We know this is true based on the given fact - if neither the Fantug nor Loperit win, the Frallon automatically wins. \n\nHowever, the question is trying to mislead us by stating the Fantug is likely to win. This information is irrelevant to the actual question being asked.  The question specifically focuses on the scenario where the Fantug *doesn't* win.\n\n**Therefore, in the scenario where the Fantug doesn't win, the Frallon's chances of winning increase significantly.**\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
