    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a blimfet, a crongle, and a narzil are the leading bafwidgers. Experts expect the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most this year, followed by the crongle, with the narzil bafwidging much less. These are the only major bafwidgers, so if the crongle doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, then if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most. Moreover, the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most, and hence the crongle likely won\u2019t bafwidge the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will?",

However, we're asked about the likelihood if *only* Blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most. In this case, Crongle could still be the top bafwidger. \n\nWhile it's less likely for Crongle to bafwidge the most than Blimfet, it doesn't automatically make Narzil the most likely if Blimfet is out of the running. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
