    "user_prompt": "Suppose a flinker, a dringen, and a n\u00fcffen have the best projections to have a breakout season next year. Talent scouts believe it's highly probable the flinker will have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen, while the n\u00fcffen is an outside shot. Since these are the only top prospects, if the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. Moreover, scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season and hence the dringen likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will?",

Only in this scenario is the N\u00fcffen's breakout guaranteed.\n* **Consider Statement 2:** This statement suggests that the Flinker's success makes the Dringen's success less likely. However, it doesn't say the Dringen's success is impossible.\n\n**Reasoning:**  The question focuses on what happens IF the Flinker doesn't break out. This scenario doesn't automatically mean the Dringen WILL have a breakout season. It's possible both the Flinker and Dringen could underperform.  Only in that specific case would Statement 1 guarantee the N\u00fcffen's breakout.\n\n**Answer: No** \n"
