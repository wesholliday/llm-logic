    "user_prompt": "Suppose a fantole, a dribban, and a snorpul have the best odds to win this season's Rizzle Cup. Oddsmakers believe it's most probable the fantole will capture the cup, followed by the dribban, while the snorpul is a heavy longshot. Since these are the only top contenders, if the dribban doesn\u2019t win the cup, then if the fantole doesn\u2019t win, the snorpul will win. Moreover, the fantole likely will win the cup and hence the dribban likely won't win. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information provided:\n\n1. **Top contenders:** Fantole, Dribban, Snorpul\n2. **Odds:** Fantole (most likely), Dribban, Snorpul (longshot)\n3. **Statement:** If the Dribban doesn't win and the Fantole doesn't win, then the Snorpul will win. This is logically sound as these are the only contenders.\n4. **Statement:** The Fantole is likely to win, so the Dribban is unlikely to win. This tracks with the odds.\n\n**The Question:** Does it follow that if the Fantole doesn't win, the Snorpul likely will?\n\n**Reasoning:** While the Snorpul WILL win if the other two don't, this doesn't mean the Snorpul is LIKELY to win if the Fantole doesn't. The Dribban is still considered more likely to win than the Snorpul. The Fantole not winning simply makes it more likely the Dribban will win. \n\n**Answer:** No \n"
