    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trenist, a lanken, and a draloid are shortlisted for Drij of the Year. The trenist is considered the front runner, followed by the lanken, while the draloid is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates in contention, if the lanken doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the trenist doesn\u2019t win it, the draloid will win it. Moreover, the trenist likely will win the award and hence the lanken likely won\u2019t win it. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trenist doesn\u2019t win Drij of the Year, the draloid will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information provided:\n\n* **Fact:** Only three candidates are in the running: a trenist, a lanken, and a draloid.\n* **Fact:** If neither the lanken nor the trenist wins, the draloid wins by default.\n* **Likelihood:** The trenist is most likely to win, followed by the lanken. The draloid is a long shot.\n* **Question:** If the trenist doesn't win, is it likely the draloid will?\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nWhile we know the draloid wins IF neither the trenist nor lanken wins, the likelihood of the trenist winning is important.  Since the trenist is the frontrunner, it's more probable they will win than not. This makes it less likely the scenario where the draloid wins (trenist losing) would occur. \n\n**Answer: No** \n"
