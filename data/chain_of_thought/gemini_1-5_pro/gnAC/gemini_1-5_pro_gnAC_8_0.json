(Let's call this statement B)\n\n* **We want to know:** Does statement B necessarily mean the vampire was awake?\n\n* **Consider this:** Statement A only tells us what happens if the vampire IS awake. It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the vampire is NOT awake. \n\n* **Could the mummy be awake if the vampire was asleep?**  Possibly! There's nothing in the given information that says the mummy can only be awake if the vampire is also awake.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
