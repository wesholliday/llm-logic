This means that Kate eating salad is a necessary consequence of Ben eating pasta. \n* **We're also given:** Kate ate salad. \n* **The question is:** Does this automatically mean Ben ate pasta?\n\nConsider this:  Just because Kate ate salad doesn't mean Ben *had* to have eaten pasta. Maybe Kate eats salad all the time, regardless of what Ben eats. The original statement only tells us what happens if Ben eats pasta, not what happens if Kate eats salad.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
