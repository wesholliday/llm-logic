It doesn't work in reverse. \n\n**Example:**  If it's raining (hypothesis), then the ground is wet (conclusion).  Just because the ground is wet doesn't mean it's definitely raining. There could be other reasons.\n\nSimilarly, just because the pants were denim doesn't automatically mean the shirt was cotton. There could be other reasons for the pants being denim.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
