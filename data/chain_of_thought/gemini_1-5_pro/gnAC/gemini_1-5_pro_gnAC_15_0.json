This is written symbolically as P \u2192 Q.\n* **We're also given that the second part of the conditional statement is true:** Erin took a train (Q). \n* **The question is:** Does this automatically mean the first part of the conditional statement (P) must be true?\n\nConsider this: What if Sam took a car? The original statement (P \u2192 Q) only tells us what happens if Sam takes a plane. It doesn't say anything about other modes of transportation Sam might use.  Even if Erin takes a train, Sam could have taken something else.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
