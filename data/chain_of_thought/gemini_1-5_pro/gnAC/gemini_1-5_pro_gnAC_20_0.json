It doesn't tell us anything if the apple is NOT red. \n* **We're also given:** \"The banana was yellow.\" This information is true, but it doesn't automatically mean the apple MUST be red based on the first statement. The banana could be yellow for other reasons.\n\n**Example:** Imagine someone always paints a banana yellow, regardless of the color of any apples. In this case, the banana being yellow doesn't tell us anything about the apple's color.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
