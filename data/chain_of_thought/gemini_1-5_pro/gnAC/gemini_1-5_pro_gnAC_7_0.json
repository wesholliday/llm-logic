It doesn't say anything about what happens if Alex *doesn't* finish.  It's possible Chris finished the race even if Alex didn't. \n\n**Example:** Imagine Chris and Alex are on a team. Chris is a fast runner, Alex is slower.  Chris could finish the race, and Alex might not have. This would still make both given statements true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively say Alex finished the race.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
