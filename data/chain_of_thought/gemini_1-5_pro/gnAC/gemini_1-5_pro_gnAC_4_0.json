We can write this as \"If A, then B\".\n* **We're also given that B is true:** The robot did visit Jupiter. \n* **The question is:** Does this mean A must also be true (the alien visited Mars)?\n\nConsider this: Just because the robot visited Jupiter doesn't mean the alien *had* to visit Mars for it to happen. There could be other reasons the robot went to Jupiter. \n\n**Answer:** no \n"
