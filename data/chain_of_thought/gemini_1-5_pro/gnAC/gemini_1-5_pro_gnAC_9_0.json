We can write this as: If R, then B.\n* **We're also given that the second part of the conditional statement is true:** Mark bought the blue shirt (B is true). \n* **The question is:** Does this automatically mean Lisa bought the red shirt (is R necessarily true)?\n\nConsider this: What if Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, but Mark still bought the blue shirt for some other reason? The original statement only tells us what happens if Lisa buys the red shirt; it doesn't say anything about what happens if she doesn't. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
