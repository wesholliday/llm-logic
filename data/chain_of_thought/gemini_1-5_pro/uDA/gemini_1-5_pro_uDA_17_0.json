It doesn't mean Kate *always* eats salad, only that she does *if* Ben eats pasta.\n* **Statement 2:** Ben did not eat pasta. This tells us the condition in the first statement is not met.\n\nSince the condition (Ben eating pasta) is not met, we have no information about whether Kate ate salad or not.  The first statement only tells us what happens if Ben *does* eat pasta.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
