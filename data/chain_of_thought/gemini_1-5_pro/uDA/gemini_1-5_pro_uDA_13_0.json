It doesn't tell us the actual color of either vehicle, just that *if* the car was red, *then* the truck must be blue.\n* **Statement 2:** The car was not red. This tells us the car wasn't red, but it doesn't automatically tell us the truck's color.\n\nSince the car wasn't red, the first statement (the conditional) is not triggered.  The truck could be any color.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
