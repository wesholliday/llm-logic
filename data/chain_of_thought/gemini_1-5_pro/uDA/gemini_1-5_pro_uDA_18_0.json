Here's how it works:\n\n* **Modus Tollens:** If P, then Q. Not P, therefore not Q.\n\nLet's apply this to our problem:\n\n* **P:** The doll was plastic.\n* **Q:** The truck was metal.\n\nWe are told \"not P\" (the doll was not plastic).  Therefore, we can conclude \"not Q\" (the truck was not metal).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
