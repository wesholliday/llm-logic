It doesn't mean Lucy *only* goes to the zoo if Joe goes to the park. \n* **Statement 2:** Joe did not go to the park. This tells us the condition in the first statement is false.\n\n* **Thinking it through:**  Just because Joe didn't go to the park doesn't automatically mean Lucy didn't go to the zoo. Lucy could have gone to the zoo for other reasons.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
