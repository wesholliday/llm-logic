However, we know from Premise 2 that Alex did NOT finish. This doesn't tell us anything about Chris, just that the first part of Premise 1 isn't fulfilled.\n\n* **Since the first part of Premise 1 is NOT true**, the second part (Chris finished the race) could be either true or false.  We have no information to determine this.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
