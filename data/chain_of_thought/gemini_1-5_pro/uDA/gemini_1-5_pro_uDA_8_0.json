Statement 1 tells us the mummy is awake *only if* the vampire is also awake.  Since the vampire is confirmed to be *not* awake (Statement 2), the first statement's condition is not met. \n\nThis means the mummy's state is not determined by the vampire being awake. The mummy could be awake or asleep; we don't have enough information to know.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
