It doesn't mean Jen *only* watches basketball if Tom watches football. It just means that *if* Tom is watching football, Jen *must* be watching basketball.\n* **Statement 2:** Tom did not watch football. This tells us the condition in the first statement is not met.\n\nSince the condition (Tom watching football) is not met, we have no information about whether Jen watched basketball or not. She could have watched basketball for other reasons, or not watched at all. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
