It doesn't mean the apple *was* red, just that *if* it were, then the banana would be yellow.\n* **Statement 2:** The apple was not red. This tells us the condition in the first statement is not met.\n\n**Reasoning:** Since the condition (apple being red) is not met, we cannot conclude anything about the banana's color from the first statement. The first statement only tells us what happens *if* the apple is red. It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the apple is *not* red.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
