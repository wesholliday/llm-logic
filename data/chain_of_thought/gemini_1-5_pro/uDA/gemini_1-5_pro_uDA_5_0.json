It doesn't mean Amy *only* plays tennis if Jeff plays basketball. It just means IF Jeff plays, THEN Amy does too.\n* **Statement 2:** Jeff did not play basketball. This tells us the condition in the first statement is not met.\n\nSince the condition (Jeff playing basketball) is not met, we have no information about whether Amy played tennis or not.  She might have played tennis for other reasons, or she might not have.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
