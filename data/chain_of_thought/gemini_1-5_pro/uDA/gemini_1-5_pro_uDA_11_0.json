We can't use Premise 1 directly because it only tells us what happens if the cake *was* chocolate.\n\nThink of it this way: Premise 1 doesn't say *anything* about what happens if the cake is *not* chocolate. The muffins could be blueberry, or they could be something else entirely. We just don't have enough information.\n\n**Answer:** no \n"
