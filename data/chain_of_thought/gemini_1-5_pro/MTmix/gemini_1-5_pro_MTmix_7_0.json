(This is like saying \"If A, then B\")\n* **Statement 2:** The whiffle might not have tinked. (This means B is not guaranteed)\n\nWe need to determine if we can conclude \"The whiffle was not shanked\" (which means A is false).\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf B is not guaranteed, it means A could be either true or false.  Just because the whiffle might not have tinked doesn't automatically mean it wasn't shanked. There could be other reasons why the whiffle didn't tink even if it was shanked.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
