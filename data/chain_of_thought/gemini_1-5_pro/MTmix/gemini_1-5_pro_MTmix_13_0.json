(This sets up a conditional relationship: slogged \u2192 tragged)\n* **Statement 2:** The glip might not have tragged. (This introduces the possibility that \"tragged\" didn't happen).\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf \"tragged\" might not have happened, then according to Statement 1, \"slogged\" also couldn't have happened.  Why? Because Statement 1 says if \"slogged\" happened, then \"tragged\" *must* have happened. \n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
