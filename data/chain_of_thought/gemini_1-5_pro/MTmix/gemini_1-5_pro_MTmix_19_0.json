According to Statement 1, this would mean the smonk MUST have plagged.\n* **Contradiction:**  But Statement 2 says the smonk MIGHT NOT have plagged. This directly contradicts the consequence of assuming the smonk was vreebled. \n\n**Conclusion:** To avoid a contradiction, the smonk could not have been vreebled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
