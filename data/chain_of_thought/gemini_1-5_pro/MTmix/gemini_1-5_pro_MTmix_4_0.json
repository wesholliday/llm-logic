This sets up a conditional relationship: snurgled -> crinkled.\n* **Statement 2:** The fribble might not have crinkled. This introduces the possibility that the fribble did NOT crinkle.\n* **Question:** Can we infer \"The fribble was not snurgled\"?\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf the fribble did NOT crinkle (as Statement 2 allows), and snurgling ALWAYS leads to crinkling (Statement 1), then the fribble couldn't have been snurgled. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
