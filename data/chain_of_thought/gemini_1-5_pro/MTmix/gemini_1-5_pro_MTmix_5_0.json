(This is a conditional statement: IF fraggled, THEN smoogled)\n* **Statement 2:** The zinger might not have been smoogled. (This tells us it's possible the zinger wasn't smoogled).\n\nNow let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* **Possibility 1: Zinger WAS fraggled.**  If so, according to Statement 1, it MUST have been smoogled. But this contradicts Statement 2, which says it might NOT have been smoogled. So, this possibility is ruled out.\n* **Possibility 2: Zinger WAS NOT fraggled.** This possibility aligns with both statements. It doesn't violate the conditional in Statement 1, and it leaves room for the zinger to be either smoogled or not smoogled.\n\nSince Possibility 2 is the only one that works, we can infer that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
