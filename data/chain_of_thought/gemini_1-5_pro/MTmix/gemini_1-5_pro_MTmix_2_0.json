It DOESN'T say that bimming ONLY happens after flooping.  \n* Statement 2 tells us there's a chance the wug didn't bim. This doesn't directly tell us anything about whether the wug was flooped or not.\n\nCould the wug have been flooped even if it might not have bimmed?  Possibly. Maybe something else besides flooping can also lead to bimming. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
