This sets up a conditional relationship: sproinged \u2192 garpled.\n* **Statement 2:** It might not have been garpled. This introduces the possibility that the wug was NOT garpled.\n\nNow let's consider the inference:\n\n* **Inference:** The wug was not sproinged.  To see if this is valid, we can use the contrapositive of Statement 1. The contrapositive flips and negates the original statement:  NOT garpled \u2192 NOT sproinged.\n\nSince Statement 2 allows for the possibility of \"NOT garpled\", and the contrapositive tells us \"NOT garpled\" leads to \"NOT sproinged\", the inference is valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
