Let's see if it holds:\n    * **If C is true (the sneg WAS crampled),** then S MUST be true (it sproted the frink) based on the first statement. This contradicts the second statement, which says S might NOT be true. So, C being true leads to a problem.\n    * **If C is false (the sneg was NOT crampled),** then the first statement doesn't tell us anything about S (it only applies if C is true). The second statement, that S might be false, is still possible.\n\n* **Conclusion:** Since assuming C is true leads to a contradiction, the only way both statements can be true is if C is false.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
