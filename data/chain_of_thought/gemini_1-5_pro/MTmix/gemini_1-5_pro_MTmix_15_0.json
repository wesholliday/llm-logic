According to Statement 1, it would then have to be spened.\n* **Contradiction:**  But Statement 2 says the dreb might *not* have been spened. This creates a contradiction if we assume the dreb was vroombed.\n* **Resolution:** To avoid the contradiction, we must conclude that the dreb was NOT vroombed.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
