(This is a conditional statement, like \"If it rains, then the ground is wet.\")\n* **Statement 2:** It might not have been surned. (This introduces the possibility that the \"then\" part of statement 1 is not true).\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf something \"might not\" be true, it means it's possible it's NOT true.  Since statement 2 tells us the fleeg might not have been surned, it means the \"then\" part of statement 1 might not have happened. \n\nIf the \"then\" part of a conditional statement might not have happened, it means the \"if\" part might not have happened either.\n\n**Therefore:**\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
