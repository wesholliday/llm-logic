(This is like saying \"If A, then B\")\n* **Statement 2:** The flug might not have been zimmed. (This means it's possible that B is not true)\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf it's possible that the flug was NOT zimmed (Statement 2), then it's also possible that the flug was NOT blummed. Why? Because Statement 1 tells us that being blummed GUARANTEES being zimmed.  If something isn't zimmed, it couldn't have been blummed in the first place.\n\n**Answer: Yes** \n"
