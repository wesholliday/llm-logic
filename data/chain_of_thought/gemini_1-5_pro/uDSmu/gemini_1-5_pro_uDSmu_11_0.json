This presents two possible locations.\n* **Premise 2:** It's not true that the newspaper must be on the porch. This eliminates one possibility. \n\nSince the newspaper can't be on the porch (due to Premise 2) and must be in one of the two locations (due to Premise 1), the only remaining possibility is the driveway.\n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
