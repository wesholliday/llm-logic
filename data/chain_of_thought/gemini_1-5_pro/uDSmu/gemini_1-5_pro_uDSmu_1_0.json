This means there are two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Statement 2:** It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden. This eliminates one of the possibilities from Statement 1.\n\nSince the second statement tells us Fido is NOT necessarily in the garden, and the first statement says Fido must be either inside OR in the garden, the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
