This means one of the two statements MUST be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The twonk is not plinked. This eliminates one possibility from Premise 1.\n* **Conclusion:** Since the twonk cannot be plinked (from Premise 2) and one of the two options in Premise 1 MUST be true, the only remaining possibility is that the twonk is varnished.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
