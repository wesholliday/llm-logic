This means there are only two possibilities, and one of them must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The clug is not snugged. This eliminates one of the possibilities from Premise 1.\n* **Conclusion:** Since one possibility is eliminated and only one other possibility remains, that remaining possibility (the clug is fleeked) must be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
