This means there are two possibilities, and at least one must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The sprocket is not daggled. This eliminates one of the possibilities. \n\nSince one possibility is eliminated and at least one *must* be true, the remaining possibility must be the correct one.\n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
