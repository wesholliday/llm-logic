This means the fribble must be one or the other, or possibly both.\n* **Premise 2:** The fribble is not crinked. This eliminates one possibility from Premise 1.\n\nSince the fribble must be either snurgled or crinked, and we know it's not crinked, the only remaining possibility is that it's snurgled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
