This means it has to be one or the other, or potentially both.\n* **Premise 2:** The glip is not tragged. This eliminates one possibility from Premise 1. \n\nSince the glip cannot be tragged (Premise 2) and it must be either slogged or tragged (Premise 1), the only remaining possibility is that the glip is slogged.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
