This means the wug must be in one of these states, and it could be in both.\n* **Premise 2:** The wug is not bimmed. This eliminates one possibility from Premise 1.\n\nSince the wug cannot be bimmed (Premise 2) and it must be either flooped or bimmed (Premise 1), the only remaining possibility is that the wug is flooped.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
