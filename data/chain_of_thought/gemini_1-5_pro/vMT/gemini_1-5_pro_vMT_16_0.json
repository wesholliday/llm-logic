(Not Q)\n* **Conclusion:** The shirt was not cotton. (Not P)\n\nThis argument structure is known as *modus tollens*. Modus tollens is a valid argument form. Here's why:\n\n* **If the original statement (If P, then Q) is true,** and \n* **We know that Q is false (Not Q),** \n* **Then P must also be false (Not P).**\n\nIn simpler terms, if the pants weren't denim, the shirt couldn't have been cotton (assuming the first premise is true).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
