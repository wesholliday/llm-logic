Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Assume the first premise is true.** If Joe going to the park would *guarantee* Lucy went to the zoo...\n2. **And the second premise is true.**  ...but we know Lucy *didn't* go to the zoo...\n3. **Then the first part of the first premise MUST be false.** ...then Joe couldn't have gone to the park. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
