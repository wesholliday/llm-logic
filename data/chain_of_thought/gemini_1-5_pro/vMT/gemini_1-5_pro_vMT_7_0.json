Modus tollens arguments are always logically valid. Here's why:\n\n* **If the first premise is true**, and Alex *did* finish the race, then Chris *must* have finished the race as well. \n* **The second premise tells us** Chris did *not* finish the race. \n* **Therefore**, because Chris didn't finish, Alex couldn't have finished either (otherwise the first premise would be false).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
