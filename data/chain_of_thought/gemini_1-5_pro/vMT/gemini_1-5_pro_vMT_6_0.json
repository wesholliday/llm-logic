This sets up a conditional relationship.\n* **Premise 2:** Bob did not choose pasta. This gives us concrete information about Bob's choice.\n* **Conclusion:** Sue did not choose pizza. This is what we're trying to determine.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf the first premise is true, and Sue *did* choose pizza, then Bob *must* have chosen pasta.  However, we know Bob did *not* choose pasta. This directly contradicts the outcome implied by the first premise if Sue chose pizza. Therefore, for the premises to be true, Sue could not have chosen pizza.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
