This sets up a conditional relationship.\n* **Premise 2:** The robot did not visit Jupiter. This gives us concrete information about the second part of Premise 1.\n* **Conclusion:** The alien did not visit Mars. This is what we're trying to determine the validity of.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf the original statement (Premise 1) is true, and the second part of that statement is false (Premise 2), then the first part of the statement must also be false.  This is a valid application of the concept of *modus tollens* in logic.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
