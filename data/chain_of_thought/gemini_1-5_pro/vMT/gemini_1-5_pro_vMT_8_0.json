            "content": "Let's break down this argument:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.  This sets up a conditional relationship.\n* **Premise 2:** The mummy was not awake. This gives us a concrete fact.\n* **Conclusion:** The vampire was not awake. This is what we're trying to determine.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf the first premise is true, and the mummy was NOT awake (as stated in the second premise), then the vampire couldn't have been awake either.  Why? Because if the vampire WAS awake, the mummy would HAVE to be awake according to the first premise. \n\nThis form of argument is called *Modus Tollens*, and it's a valid way to reach a conclusion.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
