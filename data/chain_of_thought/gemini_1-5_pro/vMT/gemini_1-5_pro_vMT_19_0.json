This sets up a conditional relationship.\n* **Premise 2:** Jen did not watch basketball. This gives us concrete information about Jen's actions.\n* **Conclusion:** Tom did not watch football.  The argument is trying to conclude this based on the premises.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe argument structure matches a classic logical form called *Modus Tollens*.  Modus Tollens states:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not Q\n3. Therefore, Not P\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P = Tom watched football\n* Q = Jen watched basketball\n\nThe argument follows the Modus Tollens structure exactly. Modus Tollens is a valid form of argument.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
