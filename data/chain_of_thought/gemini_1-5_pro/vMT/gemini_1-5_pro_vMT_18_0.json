            "content": "Let's break down this argument:\n\n* **Premise 1:** If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This sets up a conditional statement where a plastic doll implies a metal truck.\n* **Premise 2:** The truck was not metal. This tells us the \"then\" part of our conditional statement is false.\n* **Conclusion:** The doll was not plastic.  The argument is trying to conclude that because the \"then\" part was false, the \"if\" part must also be false.\n\nThis is the structure of a valid argument form called *Modus Tollens*.  If the original statement (If P, then Q) is true, and we know Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
