Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Assume the first premise is true.**  If Jeff playing basketball always means Amy plays tennis...\n2. **Consider the second premise.** We're told Amy *didn't* play tennis.\n3. **The only way both premises can be true is if Jeff didn't play basketball.** If he had, then according to the first premise, Amy would have played tennis.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
