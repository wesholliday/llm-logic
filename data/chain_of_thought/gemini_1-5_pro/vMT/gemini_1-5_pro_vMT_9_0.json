We can symbolize this as: If R, then B.\n* **Premise 2:** Mark did not buy the blue shirt. We can symbolize this as: Not B.\n* **Conclusion:** Lisa did not buy the red shirt. We can symbolize this as: Not R.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThis argument structure is called *Modus Tollens*.  Modus Tollens is a valid argument form. Here's why:\n\n* If the first premise is true (If R, then B), and...\n* The second premise is true (Not B), then...\n* The conclusion MUST be true (Not R).\n\n**Answer: Yes** \n"
