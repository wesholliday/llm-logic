Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\nLet's apply this to our argument:\n\n* **P:** Ben ate pasta\n* **Q:** Kate ate salad\n\nWe are told Q is false (Kate did not eat salad).  Therefore, for the conditional statement to hold true, P must also be false (Ben did not eat pasta).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
