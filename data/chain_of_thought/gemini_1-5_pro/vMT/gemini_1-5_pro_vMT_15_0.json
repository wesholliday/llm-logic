This is a conditional statement.\n* **Premise 2:** Erin did not take a train (not T).\n* **Conclusion:** Sam did not take a plane (not P).\n\nWe need to see if the conclusion *must* be true if the premises are true.  \n\nConsider this: If the first premise is true, and Erin did *not* take a train, then Sam could not have taken a plane. If he had, the first premise would be false.\n\nSince the conclusion follows logically from the premises, the argument is valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
