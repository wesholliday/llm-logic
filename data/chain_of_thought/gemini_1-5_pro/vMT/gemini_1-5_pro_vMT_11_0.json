This sets up a conditional relationship.\n* **Premise 2:** The muffins were not blueberry. This gives us information about the second part of the conditional statement in Premise 1.\n* **Conclusion:** The cake was not chocolate. This is what the argument is trying to prove.\n\nConsider this: If the original statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is true, and we know the muffins *weren't* blueberry, then the cake couldn't have been chocolate.  This is because the original statement links chocolate cake to blueberry muffins.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
