This sets up a conditional relationship.\n* **Premise 2:** The truck was not blue. This gives us concrete information about the truck's color.\n* **Conclusion:** The car was not red. This is what the argument is trying to prove.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nIf the original statement (If the car was red, then the truck was blue) is true, and we know the second part (the truck was blue) is false, then the first part (the car was red) must also be false. This is because the original statement only holds true if both parts are true or if the first part is false.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
