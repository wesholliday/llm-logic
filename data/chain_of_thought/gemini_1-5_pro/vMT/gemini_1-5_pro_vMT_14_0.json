This sets up a conditional relationship.\n* **Premise 2:** The wolf was not in the den. This tells us the \"then\" part of our conditional statement is false.\n* **Conclusion:** The bear was not in the cave.  The argument is trying to conclude the \"if\" part of the conditional statement is also false.\n\nThis is the structure of a valid argument form called *Modus Tollens*.  If the \"then\" part of a true \"if, then\" statement is false, then the \"if\" part must also be false.\n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
