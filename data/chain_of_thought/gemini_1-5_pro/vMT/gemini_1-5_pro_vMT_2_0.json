(If G, then U)\n* **Premise 2:** The unicorn was not in the forest. (Not U)\n* **Conclusion:** The griffin was not in the forest. (Not G)\n\nThis argument structure is known as *modus tollens*. Modus tollens is a valid argument form. Here's why:\n\nIf the first premise is true (If G, then U), and we know the second premise is true (Not U), then the conclusion (Not G) must also be true.  If the unicorn wasn't in the forest, the griffin couldn't have been either, otherwise, the first premise would be false.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
