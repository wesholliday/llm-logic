This sets up a conditional relationship.\n* **Premise 2:** Sue was not at the wedding. This gives us concrete information.\n* **Conclusion:** Mary was not at the wedding. This is what we're trying to determine.\n\nConsider this: If the first premise is true, and Mary being at the wedding would guarantee Sue's presence, then Sue's absence directly implies Mary's absence. This is because the only way the first premise can hold true while Sue is absent is if Mary was also absent.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
