This sets up a conditional relationship.\n* **Premise 2:** The banana was not yellow. This gives us information about the second part of the conditional statement in Premise 1.\n* **Conclusion:** The apple was not red. This is what the argument is trying to prove.\n\nConsider this: If the original statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is true, and we know the banana wasn't yellow, then the apple couldn't have been red. If it were, the banana would have to be yellow according to our first premise.\n\nThis form of argument is called *modus tollens*, and it's a valid way of deductive reasoning.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
