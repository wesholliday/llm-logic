This means there are only two possibilities: it's movated, or it's skizzled.\n* **Premise 2:** The flob is not movated. This eliminates one of the two possibilities.\n* **Conclusion:** Since the flob can't be movated (from Premise 2), and those were the only two options (from Premise 1), it must be skizzled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
