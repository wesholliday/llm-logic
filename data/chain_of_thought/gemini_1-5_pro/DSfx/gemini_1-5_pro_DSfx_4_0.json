This means it has to be one or the other, or possibly both.\n* **Premise 2:** The fribble is not crinked. This eliminates one possibility.\n* **Conclusion:** Since it must be one or the other (premise 1) and we know it's not crinked (premise 2), the only remaining option is that it must be snurgled. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
