This means there are two possibilities, and at least one of them must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The whiffle is not tinked. This eliminates one of the possibilities.\n* **Conclusion:** Since one possibility is ruled out, and at least one possibility must be true, the remaining possibility must be the correct one.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
