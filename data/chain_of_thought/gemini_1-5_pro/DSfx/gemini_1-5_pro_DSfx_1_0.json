This means it has to be one or the other, or potentially both.\n* **Premise 2:** The flugel is not zargled. This eliminates one possibility from Premise 1.\n\nSince the flugel must be either zargled or blimmed, and we know it's not zargled, the only remaining option is that it must be blimmed.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
