This means there are only two possibilities, and one of them must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The clug is not snugged. This eliminates one of the possibilities.\n* **Conclusion:** If the clug cannot be snugged (because Premise 2 says so), and it must be either snugged or fleeked (because Premise 1 says so), then the only remaining possibility is that the clug is fleeked.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
