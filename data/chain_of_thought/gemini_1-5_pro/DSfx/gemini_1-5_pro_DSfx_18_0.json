This means there are two possibilities, and at least one of them must be true.\n* **Premise 2:** The shank is not nugged. This eliminates one of the possibilities from Premise 1. \n\nSince one possibility is eliminated and at least one must be true, the remaining possibility must be the correct one.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
