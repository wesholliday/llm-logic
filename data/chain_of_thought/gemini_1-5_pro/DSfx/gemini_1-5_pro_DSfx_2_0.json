This means it has to be one or the other, or possibly both.\n* **Premise 2:** The wug is not bimmed. This eliminates one possibility from Premise 1. \n\nSince the wug must be either bimmed or flooped, and we know it's not bimmed, the only remaining option is that it must be flooped.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
