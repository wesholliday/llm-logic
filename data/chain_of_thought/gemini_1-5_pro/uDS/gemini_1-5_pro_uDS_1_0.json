This tells us there are only two possibilities for Fido's location.\n* **Premise 2:** Fido is not in the garden. This eliminates one of the two possibilities. \n* **Conclusion:** Since the only other possibility was that Fido is inside, and we've ruled out the garden, Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
