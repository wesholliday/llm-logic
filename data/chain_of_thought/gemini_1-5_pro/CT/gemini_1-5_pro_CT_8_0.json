            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the vampire was awake (let's call this 'V'), then the mummy was awake (let's call this 'M').  We can write this as: If V, then M.\n\n* **We want to know if we can infer:** If the mummy was not awake (not M), then the vampire was not awake (not V). This is: If not M, then not V.\n\n* **Consider the relationship:**  The original statement doesn't say that the mummy being awake *requires* the vampire to be awake. It only says that *if* the vampire is awake, the mummy *must* also be awake. \n\n* **Counter-example:**  Could the mummy be awake while the vampire sleeps?  The original statement doesn't rule that out. \n\n* **Logical equivalence:** The structure \"If not M, then not V\" is the contrapositive of \"If V, then M\". The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
