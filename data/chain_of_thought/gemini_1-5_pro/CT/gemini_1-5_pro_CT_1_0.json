This means Mary's presence guarantees Sue's presence. \n\n* **Question:** Can we infer \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\"? This is asking if Sue's absence guarantees Mary's absence.\n\n* **Reasoning:**  If Sue wasn't at the wedding, it doesn't automatically mean Mary wasn't there.  Mary could have been at the wedding even if Sue wasn't. The original statement only works one way.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
