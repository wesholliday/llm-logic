            "content": "Let's break down this logic problem:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. This is a conditional statement, often written as \"If P, then Q\" where:\n    * P = The shirt was cotton\n    * Q = The pants were denim\n\n* **Statement to infer:** If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton. This is also a conditional statement:\n    * Not Q = The pants were not denim\n    * Not P = The shirt was not cotton\n\n* **Logical relationship:** The relationship between the original statement and the inference is that they are contrapositives of each other.  In logic, the contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". \n\n* **Validity of contrapositives:** Contrapositives are logically equivalent to the original statement. This means if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\n**Answer: Yes** \n"
