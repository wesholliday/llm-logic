We can represent this as: P \u2192 M\n* **Contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a statement flips and negates both parts.  The contrapositive of P \u2192 M is  \u00acM \u2192 \u00acP (If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic).\n\n* **Logical Equivalence:** A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
