We can write this as: If A, then B.\n\n* **Statement to infer:** If Mark did not buy the blue shirt (not B), then Lisa did not buy the red shirt (not A). We can write this as: If not B, then not A.\n\n* **Logical relationship:** The relationship between \"If A, then B\" and \"If not B, then not A\" is called the contrapositive.  The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\n**Answer:** yes \n"
