This is a conditional statement where Ben eating pasta is the **hypothesis** and Kate eating the salad is the **conclusion**.\n\n* **Contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and reversing their order.  The contrapositive of the original statement would be: If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\n\n* **Logical Equivalence:** A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
