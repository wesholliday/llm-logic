We can represent this as: P \u2192 Z\n* **Question:**  Can we infer \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo (~Z), then Joe did not go to the park (~P)?\" This can be represented as: ~Z \u2192 ~P\n\nThis is asking if the original statement and its **contrapositive** are logically equivalent. The contrapositive is formed by switching the hypothesis and conclusion of a statement and negating both.\n\n**The contrapositive of a true statement is always true.**\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
