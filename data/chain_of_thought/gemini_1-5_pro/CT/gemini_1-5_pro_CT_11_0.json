            "content": "Let's break down this logic problem:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. This is a conditional statement, often written as \"If P, then Q\" where:\n    * P = The cake was chocolate\n    * Q = The muffins were blueberry\n\n* **We're asked about:** If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate. This is also a conditional statement:\n    * Not Q = The muffins were not blueberry\n    * Not P = The cake was not chocolate\n\n* **Key Concept: Contrapositive**  In logic, the contrapositive of a statement switches the positions of P and Q *and* negates both. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". \n\n* **Applying it:** The statement we're asked about is the contrapositive of the original statement. Importantly, **the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.**\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
