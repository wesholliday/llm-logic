This is a conditional statement, often written as P \u2192 Q.\n\n* **Inference we're checking:** If Jen did not watch basketball (not Q), then Tom did not watch football (not P). This is also a conditional statement: not Q \u2192 not P.\n\n* **Relationship:** The inference we're checking is the *contrapositive* of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nSince the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
