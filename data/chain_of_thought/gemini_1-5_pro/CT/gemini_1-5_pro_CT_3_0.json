This is a conditional statement, often written as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\n* **Inference we're testing:** If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James. This is also a conditional statement.  It's structured as \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\n* **Logical Relationship:** The relationship between \"If P, then Q\" and \"If not Q, then not P\" is called the contrapositive.  The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
