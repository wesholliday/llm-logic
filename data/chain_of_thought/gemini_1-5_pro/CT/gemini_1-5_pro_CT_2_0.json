This is a conditional statement, where the presence of the griffin is the sufficient condition for the presence of the unicorn.\n\n* **Statement to infer:** If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest. This is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n* **Contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then reversing their order.  The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nSince the statement to infer is the contrapositive of the original statement, and contrapositives are logically equivalent, we can infer the statement.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
