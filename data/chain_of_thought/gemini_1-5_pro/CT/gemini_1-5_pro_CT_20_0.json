This is a conditional statement, where the redness of the apple is the hypothesis and the yellowness of the banana is the conclusion.\n\n* **Contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then reversing their order. The contrapositive of the original statement would be: If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\n\n* **Logical Equivalence:** A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, since the question asks if we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement, and we know that they are logically equivalent...\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
