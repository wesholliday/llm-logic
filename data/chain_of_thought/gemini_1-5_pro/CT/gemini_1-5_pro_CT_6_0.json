This is a conditional statement where Sue choosing pizza is the **hypothesis** and Bob choosing pasta is the **conclusion**.\n\n* **Contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then reversing their order.  The contrapositive of the original statement would be: If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\n\n* **Logical Equivalence:** A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, since the question asks about the contrapositive of the original statement...\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
