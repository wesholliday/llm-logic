            "content": "Let's break down this logic problem:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the car was red, then the truck was blue. This is a conditional statement, often written as \"If P, then Q\" where:\n    * P: The car was red\n    * Q: The truck was blue\n\n* **Statement to infer:** If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red. This is also a conditional statement:\n    * Not Q: The truck was not blue\n    * Not P: The car was not red\n\n* **Logical relationship:** The relationship between the original statement and the inference is called the **contrapositive**.  The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n* **Validity of the contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\n**Answer: Yes** \n"
