This is a conditional statement where playing basketball is the sufficient condition for Amy playing tennis.\n\n* **Contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement flips the hypothesis and conclusion, and negates both.  The contrapositive of the original statement would be: If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\n\n* **Logical Equivalence:** A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\n**Answer:** Yes \n"
