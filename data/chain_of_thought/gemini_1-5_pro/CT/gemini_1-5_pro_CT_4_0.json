            "content": "Let's break down this logic problem:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. This is a conditional statement, often written as \"If P, then Q\". \n    * P = The alien visited Mars\n    * Q = The robot visited Jupiter\n\n* **Statement we're analyzing:** If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars. This is also a conditional statement.\n    * Not Q = The robot did not visit Jupiter\n    * Not P = The alien did not visit Mars\n\n* **Key Concept:**  We're essentially asking if the original statement being true automatically means the second statement is also true.  The second statement is the **contrapositive** of the first. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both parts of the statement and reversing their order.\n\n* **Truth of Contrapositives:** A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\n**Answer: Yes** \n"
