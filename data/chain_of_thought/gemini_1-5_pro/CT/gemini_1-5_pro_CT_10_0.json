            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. This is a conditional statement, where \"dog inside\" is the hypothesis and \"cat outside\" is the conclusion.\n\n* **Inference to test:** If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside. This is also a conditional statement.\n\n* **Relationship:**  The inference is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement and reversing their order.\n\n* **Logical equivalence:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
