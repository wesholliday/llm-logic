            "content": "Let's break down the logic:\n\n* **Original statement:** If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. This is a conditional statement, where the bear being in the cave is the hypothesis, and the wolf being in the den is the conclusion.\n\n* **Inference we're checking:** If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave. This is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n* **Contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then reversing their order. \n\n* **Logical Equivalence:** A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nSince the inference we're checking is the contrapositive of the original statement, and we know that a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can infer that the inference is valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
