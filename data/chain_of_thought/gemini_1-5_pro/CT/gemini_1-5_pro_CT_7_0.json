This is a conditional statement where Alex finishing is the hypothesis and Chris finishing is the conclusion.\n\n* **Contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then reversing their order.  The contrapositive of the original statement would be: If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\n\n* **Logical Equivalence:** A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
