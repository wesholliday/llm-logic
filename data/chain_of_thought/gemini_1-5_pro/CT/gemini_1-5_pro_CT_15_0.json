We can represent this as P -> T.\n* **Contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent. To form the contrapositive, we reverse the order of the statements and negate both. The contrapositive of P -> T is  ~T -> ~P (If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane).\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, if the original statement is true, so is the contrapositive.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
