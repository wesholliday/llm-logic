This implies there's a possibility the alien didn't visit Mars. \n* **Inference:** It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars. This means it's not absolutely certain the alien visited Mars.\n\nSince the original statement introduces doubt about the alien's visit to Mars, it supports the inference that the visit wasn't guaranteed. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
