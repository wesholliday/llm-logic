It could be charging elsewhere, or not at all.\n* **\"It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser\"** means the watch is not obligated to be charging on the dresser. \n\nThese two statements are logically equivalent. If there's a possibility the watch isn't charging on the dresser, then it's not required to be charging there.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
