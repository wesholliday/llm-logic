It leaves room for other possibilities (like she bought a blue shirt, or no shirt at all).\n\n* **\"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\"** means it wasn't obligatory for Lisa to buy the red shirt.  This also allows for other possibilities.\n\nSince both statements allow for the possibility of Lisa not buying the red shirt, they are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
