It doesn't confirm or deny the griffin's presence.\n\n* **\"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\"**: This statement says it's not absolutely certain the griffin was in the forest. It leaves room for the possibility the griffin wasn't there.\n\nBoth statements express the same idea: there's a chance the griffin wasn't in the forest. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
