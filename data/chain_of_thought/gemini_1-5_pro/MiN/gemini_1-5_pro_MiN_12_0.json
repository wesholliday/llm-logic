It could be elsewhere, or it might be on the chair. \n* **\"It's not the case that the jacket MUST be draped over the chair\"** means the jacket is not obligated to be on the chair. It could be somewhere else.\n\nSince both statements allow for the possibility of the jacket being somewhere other than the chair, they convey the same idea.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
