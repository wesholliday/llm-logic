It doesn't mean it's definitely NOT there, just that it's not guaranteed to be there.\n\n* **\"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer\"** means the notebook is NOT required to be in the drawer.  This allows for the possibility that it might be somewhere else.\n\nSince both statements allow for the possibility of the notebook being outside the drawer, they convey the same meaning.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
