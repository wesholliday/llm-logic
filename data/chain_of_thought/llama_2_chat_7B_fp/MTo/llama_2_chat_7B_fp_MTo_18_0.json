            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The doll was not plastic\" from the given premises, we need to apply the logical rules of inference.\n\nFrom the first premise \"The truck was not metal,\" we can infer \"The truck was not plastic\" (or \"The truck was not made of metal\").\n\nFrom the second premise \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal,\" we can infer \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was not plastic\" (or \"The truck was not plastic\").\n\nNow, we need to combine these two inferences to see if we can deduce \"The doll was not plastic.\"\n\nIf the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal, which means that the truck was not plastic. Therefore, if the doll was plastic, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
