If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding, so Mary's presence at the wedding implies Sue's presence at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding either. This means that Mary's absence at the wedding implies Sue's absence at the wedding, and we can infer that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
