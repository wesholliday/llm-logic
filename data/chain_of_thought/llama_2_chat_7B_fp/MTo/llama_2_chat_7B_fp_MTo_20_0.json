            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument provided is a classic example of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a type of argument that involves two exclusive alternatives. In this case, the argument is:\n\n1. The banana was not yellow.\n2. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nFrom these two premises, we can infer that the apple was not red. Here's why:\n\nIf the apple was red, then the banana was yellow (premise 2).\nBut the banana was not yellow (premise 1).\n\nSo, if the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow. Therefore, we can conclude that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
