Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the splat is morphed. Here's how:\n\n1. The splat might not be quanked: This statement tells us that the splat is not necessarily quanked.\n2. Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked: This statement tells us that the splat must be either morphed or quanked.\n\nNow, if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed. This is because the only other option, quanking, is not possible if the splat is not quanked. Therefore, we can conclude that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
