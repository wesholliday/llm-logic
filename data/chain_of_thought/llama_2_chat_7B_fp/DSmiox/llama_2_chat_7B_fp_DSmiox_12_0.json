Either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the smip is shripped. Here's how:\n\n1. The statement \"The smip might not be lupped\" implies that the smip is not necessarily lupped.\n2. The statement \"Either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped\" implies that the smip must be either shripped or lupped.\n3.
