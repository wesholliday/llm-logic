Therefore, the grommet is sploffed.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'The grommet is sploffed' from the argument, we need to evaluate the conclusion based on the premises.\n\nThe first premise, 'The grommet might not be plopped', implies that the grommet could be in any state, including being sploffed.\n\nThe second premise, 'Either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped', implies that the grommet must be in one of two states: sploffed or plopped.\n\nFrom these premises, we can conclude that the grommet is sploffed, as the only other option is that it must be plopped, which is not mentioned in the argument.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
