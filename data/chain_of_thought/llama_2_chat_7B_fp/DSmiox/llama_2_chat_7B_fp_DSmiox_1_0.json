Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the flugel is either blimmed or zargled. However, we cannot directly infer that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nThe reason is that the statement \"The flugel might not be zargled\" implies that the flugel could be neither blimmed nor zargled. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the flugel is blimmed based solely on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
