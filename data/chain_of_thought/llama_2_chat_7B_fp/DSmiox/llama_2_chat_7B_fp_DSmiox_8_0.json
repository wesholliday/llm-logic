            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument provided is a classic example of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a type of argument that involves two mutually exclusive alternatives. In this case, the argument presents two alternatives: either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The sprocket is cranked\" from the given premises, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nIf the premises are true, then the conclusion follows logically. In this case, if the sprocket is either cranked or daggled, and it is not daggled, then it must be cranked. Therefore, we can infer \"The sprocket is cranked\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
