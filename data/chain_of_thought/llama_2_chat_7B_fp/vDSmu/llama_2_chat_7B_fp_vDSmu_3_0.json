The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nEither P or Q\nNot P\nTherefore, R\n\nIn this case, the premises are:\n\nEither the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet (P)\nIt's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet (not P)\nTherefore, the keys are in the drawer (R)\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate the conclusion based on the premises. A logically valid argument is one in which the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid. The conclusion logically follows from the premises, so the argument is valid.",
