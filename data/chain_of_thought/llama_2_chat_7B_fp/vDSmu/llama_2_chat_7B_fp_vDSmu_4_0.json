The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nEither P or Q\nNot P\nTherefore, R\n\nIn this case, the premises are:\n\nEither the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom (P)\nIt's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom (not P)\nTherefore, the cat is napping on the couch (R)\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate the conclusion based on the premises. In this case, the conclusion follows logically from the premises, so the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
