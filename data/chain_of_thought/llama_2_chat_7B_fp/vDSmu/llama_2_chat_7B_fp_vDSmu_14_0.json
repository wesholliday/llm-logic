The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nEither P or Q\nNot P\nTherefore, R\n\nIn this case, the premises are:\n\nEither the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge (P)\nIt's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge (not P)\nTherefore, the milk is on the counter (R)\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate the conclusion based on the premises. In this case, the conclusion follows logically from the premises, so the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
