The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nEither P or Q\nNot P\nTherefore, Q\n\nIn this case, the premises are:\n\nEither the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet (P)\nIt's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet (not P)\nTherefore, the jacket is draped over the chair (Q)\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate the conclusion based on the premises. In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, so the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
