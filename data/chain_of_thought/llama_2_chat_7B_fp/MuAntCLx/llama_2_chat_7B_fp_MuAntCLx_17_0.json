To determine whether we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to analyze the syntax and meaning of each word.\n\n\"The froodle must be flump\" is a grammatically correct sentence that means the subject (the froodle) must be in the state of being flump.\n\n\"Be glorp by frazzle\" is a sentence that does not make sense on its own and is likely a typo or a made-up word.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The froodle must be flump and be glorp by frazzle\" from the first sentence. The second sentence does not follow logically or grammatically from the first sentence.\n\nAnswer: No",
