In this case, the premise is \"The movie might be a comedy or it might be a drama.\"\n\nTo infer the conclusion, we need to consider the possible outcomes of the movie being a comedy or a drama. If the movie is a comedy, it might be a comedy and it might be a drama. If the movie is a drama, it might be a comedy and it might be a drama.
