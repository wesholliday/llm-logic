It is possible that Tom will choose to buy only one of these options.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Tom might buy a car and he might buy a motorcycle. The statement only suggests that Tom has a choice between buying a car or a motorcycle, but it does not provide any information about what he will actually choose to buy.\n\nAnswer: No",
