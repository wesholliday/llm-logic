The speaker is not making a definitive statement, but rather providing two possible scenarios: the package might arrive on Monday or it might arrive on Tuesday.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'The package might arrive on Monday and it might arrive on Tuesday'?\" is yes.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
