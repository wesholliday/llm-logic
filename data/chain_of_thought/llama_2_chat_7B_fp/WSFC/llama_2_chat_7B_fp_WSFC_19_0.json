It does not explicitly state that the athlete will win either gold or silver, but rather that there are two possible outcomes.\n\nTo infer that the athlete might win gold and silver, we would need additional information or context that suggests this is a possibility. However, based solely on the given statement, it is not possible to infer that the athlete will win both gold and silver.\n\nAnswer: No",
