To infer the opposite conclusion, we need to reverse the argument.\n\nIf the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug did bim something (the zoint).\nIf the wug did bim something, then it was not flooped (since flooping implies the wug did not do anything).\nTherefore, we can infer that if the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
