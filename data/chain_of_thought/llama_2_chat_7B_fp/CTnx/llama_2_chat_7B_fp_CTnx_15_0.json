To infer the opposite conclusion, we need to reverse the premise and see if the conclusion follows.\n\nIf the dreb was spened, it means that the dreb was spent on something.\n\nIf the dreb was vroombed, it means that the dreb was moved or placed somewhere.\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion follows:\n\nIf the dreb was spened, then it was not vroombed.\n\nThis is because if the dreb was spent on something, it means it was not moved or placed somewhere, which is the opposite of vroombed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
