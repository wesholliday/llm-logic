            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument being presented is a logical deduction based on the premise \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled.\" To infer the second statement, we need to reverse the order of the premises and apply the same logical deduction.\n\nIf the flugel was blimmed, it means that the flugel was not zargled, by the first premise. Therefore, if the flugel was zargled, it means that the flugel was not blimmed, by the transitive property of \"not zargled implies not blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
