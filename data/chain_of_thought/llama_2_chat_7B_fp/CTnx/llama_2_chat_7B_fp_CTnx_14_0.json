The statement is saying that if the clug was fleeked, then it did not snug, but if the clug snugged, then it was not fleeked. This is a paradoxical situation, as the two statements are mutually exclusive and cannot be true simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the clug snugged, then it was not fleeked. The statement is self-contradictory, and any attempt to use it to make inferences would lead to a logical fallacy.\n\nAnswer: No",
