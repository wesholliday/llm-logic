            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a logical inference, and we need to determine whether it is valid or not. The statement is:\n\n\"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it did not surn.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer the second statement, we need to analyze the logic of the first statement.\n\nThe first statement is saying that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it did not surn. This means that if the fleeg had the property of being bluttered, then it did not have the property of surning.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement: \"If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n\nWe can see that this statement is logically equivalent to the first statement. If the fleeg surned, then it did not have the property of being bluttered. This means that the second statement follows directly from the first statement, and we can infer the second statement from the first statement.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
