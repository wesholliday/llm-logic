To see why, let's break down the statement:\n\n* \"If the zinger was fraggled\" means that the zinger was in a certain state (fraggled).\n* \"then the zinger was not smoogled\" means that the zinger was not in another state (smoogled).\n\nFrom these two premises, we can infer that if the zinger was in the state of being fraggled, then it was not in the state of being smoogled. This is because the two states are mutually exclusive: if the zinger was fraggled, it cannot also be smoogled.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled'?\" is yes.",
