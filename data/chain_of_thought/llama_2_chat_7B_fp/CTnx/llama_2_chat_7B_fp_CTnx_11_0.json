To see why, let's break down the statement:\n\n* \"If the flug was blummed\" means that the flug was in a certain state (blummed).\n* \"then the flug was not zimmed\" means that the flug was not in another state (zimmed).\n\nFrom these two premises, we can infer that if the flug was in the state of being blummed, then it was not in the state of being zimmed. This is a valid logical inference, as the two states are mutually exclusive.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
