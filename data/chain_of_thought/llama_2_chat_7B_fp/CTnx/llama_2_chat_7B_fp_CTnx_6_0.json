            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument being presented is a logical deduction, where the conclusion is drawn based on the premise that if the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink. To determine whether we can infer the opposite conclusion, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise states that if the grommet was sploffed, then it did not plop the frink. This means that if the grommet was in a state where it could not plop the frink (i.e., it was sploffed), then it did not plop the frink.\n\nThe conclusion states that if the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed. This means that if the grommet was able to plop the frink, then it was not in a state where it could not plop the frink (i.e., it was not sploffed).\n\nBased on the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion, we can infer that if the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
