This means that if the wug was sproinged, then it was not garpled.\n\nNow, let's apply the same logic to the second statement: \"If the wug was garpled, then the wug was not sproinged.\" If the wug was garpled, then it means that it was not sproinged. Therefore, we can infer that if the wug was garpled, then it was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
