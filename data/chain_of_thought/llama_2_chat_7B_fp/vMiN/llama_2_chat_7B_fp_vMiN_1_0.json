            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a classic example of a valid argument, known as a \"disjunctive syllogism.\" A disjunctive syllogism is a type of argument that uses the logical operators \"or\" and \"not\" to arrive at a conclusion. In this case, the premise \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" can be read as \"Mary either was not at the wedding or it is not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\"\n\nThe conclusion \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" can be derived from the premise using the logical operator \"or.\" This is a valid argument because the premise and conclusion are logically connected by the \"or\" operator.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
