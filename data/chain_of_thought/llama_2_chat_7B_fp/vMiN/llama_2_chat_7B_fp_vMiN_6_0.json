The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nPremise 1: Sue might not have chosen pizza\nPremise 2: If Sue did not choose pizza, it is not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\nConclusion: Therefore, it is not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate the conclusion based on the premises. In this case, the conclusion follows logically from the premises, so the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
