In this case, the argument is:\n\nPremise: The milk might not be on the counter.\nConclusion: It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter.\n\nThe problem with this argument is that it assumes that just because the milk might not be on the counter, it must not be on the counter. However, there could be other reasons why the milk is not on the counter, such as it being in the fridge or on the stove. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: No.",
