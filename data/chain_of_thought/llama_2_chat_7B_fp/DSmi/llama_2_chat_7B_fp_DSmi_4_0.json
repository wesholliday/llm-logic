In this case, the argument states that either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom. However, the additional premise \"The cat might not be playing in the bedroom\" reduces the possible options to only one possibility, which is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nTherefore, based on the given argument, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
