            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument provided is a classic example of a disjunctive syllogism, which means that we have two exclusive possibilities: either Tom watched football or Jen watched basketball. The argument states that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball, and vice versa. However, it does not explicitly state that Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nTo answer the question, we need to consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. Tom watched football: In this case, Jen did not watch basketball, so the argument is true. Therefore, the answer is 'yes'.\n2. Tom did not watch football: In this case, Jen could have watched basketball or not watched basketball. Since the argument does not state that Jen must have watched basketball, we cannot conclude that Tom did not watch football. Therefore, the answer is 'no'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
