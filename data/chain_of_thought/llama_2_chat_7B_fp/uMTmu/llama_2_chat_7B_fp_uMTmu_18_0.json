In this case, the premise is \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" However, simply because the doll is not metal does not necessarily mean it was plastic.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic based solely on the fact that the truck is not metal. The argument is invalid, and we cannot make a conclusion based on the premises provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
