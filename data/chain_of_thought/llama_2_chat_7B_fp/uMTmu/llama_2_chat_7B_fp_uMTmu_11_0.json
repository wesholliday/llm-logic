In this case, the premises are:\n\n1. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\n2. It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate. Here's why:\n\nIf the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry (premise 1).\nHowever, it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry (premise 2).\nSo, if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must not have been blueberry. Therefore, the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
