            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument provided is a classic example of a logical deduction. It is based on the principle of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nFrom the premises given, we can deduce that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This is because the word \"if\" implies a causal relationship between the two statements, meaning that if Mary was at the wedding, then it is necessary that Sue was also at the wedding.\n\nHowever, the argument does not provide enough information to conclude that Mary was not at the wedding. The statement \"it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding\" does not provide any evidence to the contrary, and it is still possible that Sue was indeed at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding based solely on the premises provided. The argument is a logical deduction, but it does not provide enough information to reach a definitive conclusion.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
