            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument provided is a classic example of a disjunctive syllogism, which means that it is a type of argument that involves two exclusive possibilities. In this case, the argument states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis, and vice versa. However, it does not say that Amy must have played tennis.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball, we need to consider the two possibilities presented in the argument:\n\n1. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n2. It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\n\nSince the second possibility is true, we can conclude that the first possibility (Jeff playing basketball) is false. Therefore, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
