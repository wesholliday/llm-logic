In this case, the premise is \"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\" However, this does not necessarily mean that the dog was not inside.\n\nTo see why, let's consider an alternative scenario: what if the dog was inside, but the cat was also inside? In this case, the argument that the cat must have been outside would not hold. Therefore, we cannot infer that the dog was not inside based solely on the premise provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
