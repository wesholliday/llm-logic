In this case, the two statements are:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\n2. It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the vampire was not awake. This is because if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake, but since it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake, the vampire must not have been awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
