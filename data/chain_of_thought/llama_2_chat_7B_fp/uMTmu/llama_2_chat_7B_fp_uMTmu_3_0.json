If James wrote the book, then it must be a mystery novel. However, the second statement \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel\" suggests that there is no direct causal relationship between the authorship of the book and its genre.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the book was not written by James based solely on the fact that it may not be a mystery novel. The information provided does not allow us to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
