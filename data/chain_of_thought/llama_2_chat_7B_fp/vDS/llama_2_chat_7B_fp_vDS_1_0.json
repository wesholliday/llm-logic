            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument presented is in the form of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a type of argument that uses a disjunction (or \"or\") to connect two premises. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nPremise 1: Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden.\nPremise 2: Fido is not in the garden.\nConclusion: Fido is inside.\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate the conclusion based on the premises. In this case, the conclusion follows logically from the premises, so the argument is considered valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
