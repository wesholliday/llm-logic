The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nEither P or Q\nP \u2260 Q\nTherefore, P\n\nIn this case, the premises are:\n\nEither the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand\nThe notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand\n\nThe conclusion is:\nThe notebook is in the drawer\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate the argument's form and the truth of its premises.\n\nThe argument's form is valid, as it follows the correct structure of a disjunctive syllogism.\n\nHowever, the truth of the premises is uncertain. The first premise simply states that the notebook is in one of two locations, without providing any evidence or justification for this claim. The second premise is also uncertain, as there is no evidence to suggest that the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid, as the premises are not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No",
