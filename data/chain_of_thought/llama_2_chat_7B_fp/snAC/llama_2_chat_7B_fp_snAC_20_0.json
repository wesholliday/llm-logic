            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, we have two statements: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and \"The banana was yellow.\" Both of these statements are true, so we can assume that they are both valid.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the conclusion \"The apple was red\" follows logically from the premises. To do this, we need to use the logical connector \"therefore\" to link the two statements.\n\nIf we say \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,\" and we know that \"The banana was yellow,\" then we can logically conclude \"The apple was red.\" This is because the first statement implies that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow, and since we know that the banana was yellow, we can infer that the apple was red.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
