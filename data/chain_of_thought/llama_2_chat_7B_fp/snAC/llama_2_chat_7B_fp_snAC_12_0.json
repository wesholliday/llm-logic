            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, we have two statements: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" and \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" We need to determine whether it follows that \"Joe went to the park\" is true.\n\nTo do this, we can use the logical operator \"if-then\" to evaluate the statements. The if-then operator is a material conditional, which means that if the antecedent (the first part of the statement) is true, then the consequent (the second part of the statement) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent is \"If Joe went to the park,\" and the consequent is \"Then Lucy went to the zoo.\" Since both statements are true, we can conclude that the if-then operator is satisfied, and therefore the conclusion \"Joe went to the park\" follows logically.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
