If the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The robot visited Jupiter\" is true.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly conclude that \"The alien visited Mars\" is true. The second statement only tells us that the robot visited Jupiter, and does not provide any information about the alien's visit to Mars. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce that \"The alien visited Mars\" is true.\n\nAnswer: No",
