This means that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n\nNext, we know that 'Erin took a train' is true, so we can apply the implication from the first statement to conclude that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n\nHowever, we are not given any information about whether Sam took a plane. Therefore, we cannot conclude that 'Sam took a plane' is true based solely on the fact that 'Erin took a train' is true.\n\nAnswer: No",
