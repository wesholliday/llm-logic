            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, we are given two statements: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" and \"The cat was outside.\" We need to determine whether it follows that \"The dog was inside\" is true.\n\nTo do this, we can use the logical operators \"if-then\" and \"negation.\" The \"if-then\" operator states that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. The negation operator negates a statement, meaning that if the statement is true, the negated statement is false, and vice versa.\n\nSo, if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside, which means that the dog was not outside. Using the negation operator, we can say that if the dog was not outside, then the cat was inside.\n\nNow, we are given that the cat was outside. Using the logical operator \"and,\" we can say that both statements are true: the dog was not outside, and the cat was outside.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that \"The dog was inside\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
