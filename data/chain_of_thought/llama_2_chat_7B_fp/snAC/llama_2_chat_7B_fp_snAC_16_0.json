This is because if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would have been denim, which means that the shirt and pants are not made of the same material.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications of this situation. If the shirt and pants are made of different materials, then it is possible that the shirt was not cotton. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the shirt was cotton just because the pants were denim.\n\nAnswer: No",
