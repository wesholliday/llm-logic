            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, we are given two premises: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Sue was at the wedding.\" We need to determine whether it follows logically that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true.\n\nTo do this, we can use the logical connector \"If-Then\" to create a conditional statement:\n\nIf Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (premise 1)\nSue was at the wedding (premise 2)\n\nUsing the conditional statement, we can deduce that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This means that the second premise is true.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly deduce that Mary was at the wedding from the given premises. The logical connector \"If-Then\" only allows us to infer that if one statement is true, then another statement must also be true. In this case, we have established that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding, but we have not proven that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
