            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument presented is in the form of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion. The argument consists of three parts: the first premise, the second premise, and the conclusion.\n\nThe first premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. This premise is based on the assumption that there is a direct relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana.\n\nThe second premise states that the banana was not yellow. This premise is a statement of fact, and it is assumed to be true without question.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that the apple was not red. This conclusion is drawn from the first premise and the second premise, using the logical rule that if the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we must evaluate the reasoning used in the argument. In this case, the argument is valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The argument uses the logical rule of inference known as modus ponens, which states that if A implies B, and B is true, then A is true. In this case, the argument uses this rule to infer that the apple was not red, based on the premises that the banana was not yellow and that the banana was not red.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
