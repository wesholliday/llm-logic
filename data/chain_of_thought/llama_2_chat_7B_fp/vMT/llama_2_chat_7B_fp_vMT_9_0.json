            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on two premises: (1) If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt, and (2) Mark did not buy the blue shirt. The conclusion drawn from these premises is that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nTo determine the validity of this argument, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, we need to check whether the argument is logically valid.\n\nTo do this, we can use a truth table to check the validity of the argument. A truth table is a table that shows the validity of an argument by evaluating the argument's premises and conclusion for different possible values of the variables.\n\nHere is the truth table for the argument:\n\n| Premise 1 | Premise 2 | Conclusion |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| True | True | False |\n| True | False | False |\n| False | True | False |\n| False | False | True |\n\nAs we can see from the truth table, the argument is not logically valid. The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. This means that the argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
