            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is in the form of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a type of argument that uses \"either-or\" statements to reach a conclusion. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\nPremise 2: Chris did not finish the race.\nConclusion: Alex did not finish the race.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate the conclusion based on the premises. In this case, the conclusion follows logically from the premises, so the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
