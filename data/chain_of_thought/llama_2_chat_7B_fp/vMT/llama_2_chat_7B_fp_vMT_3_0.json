The first premise states that if a certain condition is true, then a certain conclusion must be true. The second premise states that the condition is not true. To determine the validity of the argument, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nIn this case, the conclusion is \"The book was not written by James.\" The first premise is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" The second premise is \"The book is not a mystery novel.\"\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The argument is not valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
