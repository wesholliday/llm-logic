Modus ponens is a form of argument that takes the form \"If A, then B; A, therefore B.\" In this case, the first premise \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" can be read as \"If the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is in the forest.\" The second premise \"The unicorn was not in the forest\" can be read as \"The unicorn is not in the forest.\" Therefore, the conclusion \"The griffin was not in the forest\" follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
