            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument presented is in the form of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion. The argument consists of three parts: the first premise, the second premise, and the conclusion.\n\nThe first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This means that if Mary was present at the wedding, then it is necessarily true that Sue was also present at the wedding.\n\nThe second premise states that Sue was not at the wedding. This means that it is false that Sue was present at the wedding.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that Mary was not at the wedding. This conclusion is drawn from the first premise and the second premise, using the logical rule that if the first premise is true and the second premise is false, then the conclusion must be true.\n\nSo, to answer your question, the argument is logically valid. The conclusion follows logically from the premises, using the logical rule of deduction.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
