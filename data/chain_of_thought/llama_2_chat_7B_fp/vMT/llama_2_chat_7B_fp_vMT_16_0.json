            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument presented is in the form of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion. The argument is as follows:\n\n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n2. The pants were not denim.\n3. Conclusion: The shirt was not cotton.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe first premise, 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim', is a logical statement that implies a causal relationship between the shirt and the pants. If the shirt is made of cotton, then it is likely that the pants are also made of cotton. However, this premise does not provide any direct evidence that the shirt is actually made of cotton.\n\nThe second premise, 'The pants were not denim', is a statement of fact that provides direct evidence that the pants are not made of denim. This premise is true by definition, as denim is a specific type of fabric that has distinct characteristics.\n\nThe conclusion, 'The shirt was not cotton', is drawn from the first premise and the second premise. If the shirt was not made of cotton, then it must have been made of something else. Since the pants are not made of denim, the shirt must be made of something else.\n\nNow, to answer the question:\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid. The premises provide sufficient evidence to support the conclusion, as they establish a causal relationship between the shirt and the pants and provide direct evidence that the pants are not made of denim. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.",
