            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument presented is in the form of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a type of argument that uses a \"or\" statement to connect the premises. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\nPremise 2: The mummy was not awake.\nConclusion: The vampire was not awake.\n\nTo determine the validity of this argument, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the type of argument: The argument is a disjunctive syllogism.\n2. Evaluate the premises: The premises are either true or false. If the premises are true, then the conclusion may or may not be true.\n3. Determine the validity of the argument: If the conclusion logically follows from the premises, then the argument is valid. Otherwise, the argument is invalid.\n\nIn this case, the premises are:\n\n* If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (Premise 1)\n* The mummy was not awake (Premise 2)\n\nBased on these premises, the conclusion is:\n\n* The vampire was not awake (Conclusion)\n\nTherefore, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
