If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n\nWe want to know if we can infer that Sue chose pizza from these statements.\n\nTo do this, we can use the rule of inference known as modus ponens. Modus ponens is a basic rule of logic that allows us to draw a conclusion from two premises, if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nSo, let's apply modus ponens to the given statements:\n\nPremise 1: Bob chose pasta.\nPremise 2: If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\nConclusion: Sue chose pizza.\n\nFrom the premises, we can logically conclude that Sue chose pizza. Therefore, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
