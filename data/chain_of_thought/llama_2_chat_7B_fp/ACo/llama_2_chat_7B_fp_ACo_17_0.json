If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\n\nWe want to know if we can infer that Ben ate pasta from these statements.\n\nTo do this, we can use the rule of inference known as modus ponens. Modus ponens is a basic rule of logic that allows us to draw a conclusion from two premises, if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nSo, let's apply modus ponens to the given statements:\n\nPremise 1: Kate ate salad.\nPremise 2: If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\nConclusion: Ben ate pasta.\n\nNow, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, it does. If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad, and Kate did eat salad. Therefore, Ben must have eaten pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
