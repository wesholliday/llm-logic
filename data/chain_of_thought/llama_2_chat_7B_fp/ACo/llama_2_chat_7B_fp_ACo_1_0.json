If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that Mary was at the wedding if Sue was at the wedding. This is because the second statement implies a causal relationship between Mary's presence at the wedding and Sue's presence at the wedding. If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary must have also been at the wedding, since Sue would not have been at the wedding if Mary was not.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
