If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nWe can use the logical connective \"if-then\" to infer a conclusion based on the given statements. The if-then connective is read as \"if A, then B,\" where A is the antecedent and B is the consequent. In this case, the antecedent is \"the griffin was in the forest\" and the consequent is \"the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\nTherefore, if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
