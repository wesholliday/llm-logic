If Bob chose pasta, and Bob chose pasta, then we can infer that Bob's choice was not the only one. Therefore, there must be at least one other person who chose something different from Bob, which in this case is pizza.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly conclude that the person who chose pizza is Sue, as there could be more than one person who chose pizza. Therefore, we can only draw a conditional conclusion that if Bob chose pasta, then there is at least one other person who chose something different from Bob, which could be pizza, but we cannot identify that person as Sue without additional information.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
