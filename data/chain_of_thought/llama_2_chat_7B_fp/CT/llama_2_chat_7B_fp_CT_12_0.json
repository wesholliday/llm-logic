            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument being made is based on the premise \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This premise is using the material conditional, which is a type of logical connector that establishes a cause-and-effect relationship between two statements. In this case, if Joe went to the park, then it is implied that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nTo apply this logic to the second premise, we can ask ourselves, \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then what?\" The answer is \"Then Joe did not go to the park.\" This is because if Lucy did not go to the zoo, then she did not go to the park, as the two events are mutually exclusive.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
