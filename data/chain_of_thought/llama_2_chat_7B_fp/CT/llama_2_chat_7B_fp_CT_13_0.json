            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument being presented is a logical deduction based on the premise \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This premise implies that there is a direct relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck, where if the car is red, then the truck must be blue.\n\nTo apply this logic to the second premise, we can ask ourselves, \"If the truck was not blue, then what else could it be?\" The answer is \"It could be any other color.\" In other words, if the truck is not blue, then it could be any other color, including red.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the truck was not blue, then the car was not red. This is because the premise \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" does not provide any information about the color of the car if the truck is not blue.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
