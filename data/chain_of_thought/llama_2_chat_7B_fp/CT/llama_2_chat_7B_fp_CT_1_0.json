            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument being presented is a classic example of a logical deduction, where we are trying to infer a conclusion based on two premises. The premises are:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n2. If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer the conclusion, we need to evaluate the argument using the rules of logical deduction.\n\nThe argument form is:\n\nPremise 1: If A, then B\nPremise 2: Not B\nConclusion: Not A\n\nUsing the rules of logical deduction, we can see that the argument is valid, meaning that the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Therefore, we can infer that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
