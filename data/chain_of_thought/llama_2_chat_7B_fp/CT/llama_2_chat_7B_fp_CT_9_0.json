            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is an example of a logical inference, which means that we can draw a conclusion based on the information provided. In this case, we are given two premises: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt,\" and \"Then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" These premises imply a causal relationship between Lisa's action (buying the red shirt) and Mark's action (buying the blue shirt).\n\nNow, we are asked to infer whether we can conclude \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" To answer this question, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two premises.\n\nSince the first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt, we can infer that if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is because the causal relationship between the two actions implies that if one action occurred, the other action must also have occurred.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
