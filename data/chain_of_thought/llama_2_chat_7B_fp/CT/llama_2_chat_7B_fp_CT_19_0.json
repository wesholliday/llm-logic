            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument being presented is a logical deduction based on the premise \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This premise implies that there is a causal relationship between Tom's action of watching football and Jen's action of watching basketball, where one action (watching football) causes the other action (watching basketball).\n\nTo apply this logic to the second premise, we can ask ourselves, \"If Jen did not watch basketball, what would be the likelihood that Tom watched football?\" Based on the premise, it is likely that if Jen did not watch basketball, Tom did not watch football either, as there is no evidence to suggest that Tom watched football independently of Jen's actions. Therefore, we can infer that \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
