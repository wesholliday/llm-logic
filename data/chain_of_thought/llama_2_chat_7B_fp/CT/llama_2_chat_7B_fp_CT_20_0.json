The argument is:\n\nIf the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nFrom this premise, we cannot infer that if the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red. The reason is that the argument is based on a false assumption, that is, the assumption that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. This is not necessarily true, as there may be other factors that affect the color of the apple and banana.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that can be drawn from the argument is \"Answer: No.\"",
