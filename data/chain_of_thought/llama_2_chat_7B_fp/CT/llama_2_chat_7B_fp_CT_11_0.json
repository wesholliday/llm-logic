This means that if the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\n\nTo infer the second statement, we can use the transitive property of equality, which states that if A = B and B = C, then A = C.\n\nApplying this property to the given premises, if the muffins were not blueberry, then we can infer that the cake was not chocolate (A = muffins, B = blueberry, C = chocolate). Therefore, the answer is 'yes'.",
