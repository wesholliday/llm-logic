            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument being presented is a logical deduction based on the premise \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This premise implies that there is a direct relationship between Jeff's action (playing basketball) and Amy's action (playing tennis). If Jeff did something, then Amy did the opposite.\n\nTo apply this logic to the second premise, we can ask: If Amy did not play tennis, what did Jeff do? Since Amy's action (playing tennis) is the opposite of Jeff's action (playing basketball), if Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
