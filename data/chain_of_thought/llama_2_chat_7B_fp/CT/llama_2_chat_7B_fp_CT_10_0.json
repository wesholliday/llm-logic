This means that if the dog was not outside, then the cat was not inside. However, the premise does not provide any information about the cat's location outside. It only states that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside\" from the given premise. The premise only provides a conditional statement, and it does not provide enough information to draw a conclusion about the cat's location outside.\n\nAnswer: No",
