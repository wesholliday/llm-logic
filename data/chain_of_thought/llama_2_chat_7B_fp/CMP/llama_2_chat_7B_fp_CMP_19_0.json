    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don\u2019t increase the most, then if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won\u2019t increase the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

Rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year.\n2. Economists project that rents will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less.\n3. Since rents and home prices are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, if home prices don't increase the most, then if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.\n4. Therefore, it follows that if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.\n\nNow, based on the above reasoning, here's the answer to the question:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
