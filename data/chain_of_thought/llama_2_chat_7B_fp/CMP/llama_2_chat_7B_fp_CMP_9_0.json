    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it\u2019s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be. Moreover, it\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument presented in the passage is based on the assumption that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits, and that if one of these fruits is not the top-selling fruit, then the other two will be. The argument also assumes that apples are likely to be the top-selling fruit, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind.\n\nTo determine whether it follows that it is likely that, if apples aren't the top-selling fruit, oranges will be, we need to consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. Apples are the top-selling fruit: In this case, bananas will be the second-most sold fruit, and oranges will be the third-most sold fruit. Therefore, it is likely that oranges will be the top-selling fruit if apples are not. Answer: Yes.\n2. Bananas are the top-selling fruit: In this case, apples will be the second-most sold fruit, and oranges will be the third-most sold fruit. Therefore, it is likely that oranges will be the top-selling fruit if bananas are not. Answer: Yes.\n3. Oranges are the top-selling fruit: In this case, apples will be the second-most sold fruit, and bananas will be the third-most sold fruit. Therefore, it is likely that apples will be the top-selling fruit if oranges are not. Answer: No.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it is possible that oranges will be the top-selling fruit if apples are not, but it is not guaranteed.",
