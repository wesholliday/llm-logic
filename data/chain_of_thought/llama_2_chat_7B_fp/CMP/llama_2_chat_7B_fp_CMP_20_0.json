    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument presented in the passage is based on the assumption that coffee, tea, and soda are the only major morning beverages consumed by people. The argument also assumes that market research indicates that coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings.\n\nTo determine whether it follows that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers, we need to consider the following possibilities:\n\n1. If coffee retains the most morning drinkers, then tea will not retain the most morning drinkers.\n2. If tea retains the most morning drinkers, then soda will not retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nFrom the given information, we can conclude that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then tea will not retain the most morning drinkers either. Therefore, the only possible scenario where soda will retain the most morning drinkers is if tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
