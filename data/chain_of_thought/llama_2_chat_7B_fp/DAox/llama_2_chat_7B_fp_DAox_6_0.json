If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nTo infer whether the grommet plopped the frink or not, we need to analyze the given statements.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the grommet did not sploff. This means that the grommet did not release any liquid or substance.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that if the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink. However, since the grommet did not sploff, it means that the grommet was not sploffed, and therefore, it did not plop the frink.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
