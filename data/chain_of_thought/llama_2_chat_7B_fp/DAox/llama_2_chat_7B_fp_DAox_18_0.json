If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\n2. The shank was not plooked.\n3. Therefore, the shank was not nugged.\n\nHowever, this argument is invalid because the second premise does not necessarily lead to the conclusion. Just because the shank was not plooked does not mean it was not nugged. There could be other factors at play that would result in the shank being nugged without it being plooked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the shank was not nugged solely based on the premises provided. The argument is invalid and does not logically follow.\n\nAnswer: No.",
