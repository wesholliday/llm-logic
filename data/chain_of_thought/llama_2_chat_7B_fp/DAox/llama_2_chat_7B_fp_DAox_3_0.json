If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\n\nTo infer whether the splat did not quank based on these statements, we need to follow the logical implications of the statements.\n\nIf the splat was morphed, then it means that the splat underwent a transformation. If the splat underwent a transformation, then it means that it changed its form or shape.\n\nNow, if the splat did not quank, it means that it did not perform the action of quanking. If the splat did not quank, then it means that it did not change its form or shape in the way that quanking would imply.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the splat did not quank.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
