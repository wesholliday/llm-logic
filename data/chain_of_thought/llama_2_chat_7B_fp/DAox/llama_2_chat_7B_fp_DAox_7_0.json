We are given two premises: \"The whiffle was not shanked\" and \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\" From these premises, we need to deduce a conclusion about the whiffle's behavior.\n\nTo do this, we can use the logical operator \"implication.\" If the whiffle was shanked, then it tinked. If it did not tink, then it did not shank. Therefore, we can conclude that the whiffle did not tink if it did not shank.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
