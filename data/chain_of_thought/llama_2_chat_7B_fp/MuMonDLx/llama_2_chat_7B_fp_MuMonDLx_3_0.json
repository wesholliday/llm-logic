In this case, the condition is that the zibber must be in the floob.\n\nHowever, the sentence does not provide any information about the location of the zibber beyond the fact that it must be in the floob. It does not imply or suggest that the zibber may be located on the floob as well.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The zibber must be in the floob or on the floob\" from the given sentence. The inference would be \"The zibber must be in the floob,\" as there is no information to suggest that it may be located on the floob as well.\n\nAnswer: No",
