Homophones are words that sound the same but have different meanings and spellings. In this case, \"frazzle\" and \"froodle\" are two possible meanings of the word \"frazzle\", while \"wobble\" is another possible meaning.\n\nTo infer whether \"The frazzle must be froodle or wobble\", we need to consider the context of the sentence and the possible meanings of \"frazzle\".
