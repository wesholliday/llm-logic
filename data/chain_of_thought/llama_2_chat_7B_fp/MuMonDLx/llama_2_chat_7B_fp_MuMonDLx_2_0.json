To infer the second statement \"The wump must be on the plimp or in the quank,\" we need to use the logical operator \"or.\"\n\nThe logical operator \"or\" allows us to combine two statements using the words \"or\" instead of \"and.\" In this case, we can write:\n\nThe wump must be on the plimp or in the quank\n\nThis means that either the wump is on the plimp or it is in the quank.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
