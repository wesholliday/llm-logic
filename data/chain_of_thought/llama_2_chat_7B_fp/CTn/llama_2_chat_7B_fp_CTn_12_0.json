Transitivity states that if A implies B, and B implies C, then A implies C.\n\nApplying this principle to the given statement, we have:\n\n* If Joe went to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo (A implies B)\n* If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park (B implies C)\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
