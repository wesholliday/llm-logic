To apply this argument to a new situation, we need to reverse the premise and conclusion. In other words, we need to swap the roles of Ben and Kate.\n\nSo, if we replace Ben with Kate and Ben's action (eating pasta) with Kate's action (eating the salad), we can infer that if Kate ate the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
