If the muffins were blueberry, it means they had a certain characteristic (blueberry). If the cake was chocolate, it means it had a different characteristic (chocolate). Therefore, if the muffins were blueberry, the cake could not have been chocolate, which means the conclusion \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\" follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
