            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake\" from the given statement, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was not awake\" implies that if the vampire is awake, it means the mummy is not awake. This is because the word \"if\" in the statement implies a causal relationship between the two statements.\n\nNow, we need to apply the same logic to the second statement \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake.\" If we assume that the mummy is awake, it means that the vampire is not awake, which is the opposite of what the first statement implies.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake\" from the given statement. The two statements are logically incompatible, and we cannot draw a conclusion that the vampire is not awake if the mummy is awake.\n\nAnswer: No",
