This means that if the book is a mystery novel, then it was not written by James.\n\nTo further explain, if the book was written by James, then it must conform to the characteristics of a book written by James. Since a mystery novel is a specific genre with its own set of characteristics, if the book does not conform to those characteristics, then it cannot be a mystery novel. Therefore, if the book is a mystery novel, it must have been written by someone else, not James.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
