            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that if the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton, we need to analyze the given statements.\n\nThe statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim\" implies that if the shirt is made of cotton, then the pants are not made of denim. This means that there is a logical relationship between the two statements, where if one statement is true, the other statement must also be false.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement: \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\" This statement is similar to the first statement, but it is not necessarily true. Just because the pants are denim, it doesn't mean that the shirt is not cotton.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton. The two statements are not logically related, and we cannot make a conclusion based on the first statement alone.\n\nAnswer: No",
