This law states that a statement and its negation cannot both be true.\n\nIn this case, we have two statements: \"If the dog was inside\" and \"If the cat was outside.\" If we assume that the first statement is true, then the second statement must be false, as the dog cannot be inside and the cat outside at the same time. Therefore, we can infer that if the dog was inside, then the cat was not outside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
