            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If the truck was blue, then the car was not red\" from the statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was not blue,\" we need to use the law of non-contradiction. This law states that a statement and its negation cannot both be true.\n\nIn this case, we know that if the car was red, then the truck was not blue. This means that the statement \"the car was red\" and its negation \"the truck was blue\" cannot both be true. Therefore, we can infer that if the truck was blue, then the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
