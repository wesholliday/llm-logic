            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument provided is a logical deduction, where the conclusion is drawn based on the premise that if the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow. To apply this argument to the new situation, we need to substitute the new object (banana) for the apple in the premise.\n\nSo, if the banana was yellow, then the apple (which was not red in the original argument) was not red. Therefore, we can infer that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
