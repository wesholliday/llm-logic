The reason is that the argument only establishes a negative connection between Mary and the wedding, but does not provide any information about the relationship between Sue and the wedding.\n\nTo make an inference about the relationship between Sue and the wedding, we would need additional information or evidence. For example, if we know that Sue is a close friend of Mary's, then we might infer that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was likely also at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No.",
