Specifically, if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen something else, which in this case is pasta.\n\nNow, let's apply the same reasoning to the second statement: \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\" If Bob chose pasta, then Sue must have chosen something else, which in this case is not pizza.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
