Either the grommet is sploffed or it is plopped.\n2. The grommet is not plopped.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can deduce that the grommet is sploffed. Here's how:\n\n1. If the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed (by definition of \"sploffed\").\n2. Therefore, the grommet is either sploffed or plopped.\n\nSo, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'The grommet is sploffed' from the given statements?\" is:\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
