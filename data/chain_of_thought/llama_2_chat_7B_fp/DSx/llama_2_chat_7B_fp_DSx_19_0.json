We need to use logical reasoning to determine whether we can infer \"The smonk is vreebled\" from these statements.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that either the smonk is vreebled or it is plagged. This means that the smonk cannot be both vreebled and plagged at the same time.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the smonk is not plagged. This means that if the smonk is vreebled, it cannot be plagged.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that if the smonk is not plagged, it must be vreebled. So, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
