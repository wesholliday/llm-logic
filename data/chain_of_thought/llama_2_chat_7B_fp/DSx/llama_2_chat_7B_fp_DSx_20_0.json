            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument provided is a classic example of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a type of argument that involves two exclusive possibilities. In this case, the argument states that either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned, and the second premise states that the fleeg is not surned.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the fleeg is bluttered from these premises, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two premises. Since the fleeg is not surned, it must be bluttered. Therefore, we can infer that the fleeg is bluttered from the premises given.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
