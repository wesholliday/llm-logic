This means that there are only two possible states for the clug: fleeked or snugged.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the clug is not snugged. This means that the only possible state for the clug is fleeked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The clug is fleeked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
