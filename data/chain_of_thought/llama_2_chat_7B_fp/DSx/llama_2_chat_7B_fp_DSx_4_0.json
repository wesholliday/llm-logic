We need to use logical reasoning to determine whether we can infer \"The fribble is snurgled\" from these statements.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that either the fribble is snurgled or it is crinked. This means that if the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the fribble is not crinked. This means that if the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
