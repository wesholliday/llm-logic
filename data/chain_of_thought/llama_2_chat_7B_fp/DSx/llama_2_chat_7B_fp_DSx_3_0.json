            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statements are: \"Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked\" and \"The splat is not quanked.\" We need to use logical reasoning to determine whether we can infer \"The splat is morphed\" from these statements.\n\nTo do this, we can use the law of excluded middle, which states that for any proposition P, either P is true or its negation \u00acP is true. Applying this law to our situation, we can say that either the splat is morphed or it is not morphed. Since the splat is not quanked, we can conclude that the splat is either morphed or not morphed.\n\nNow, we need to determine which of these two possibilities is more likely. If the splat is not morphed, then it is quanked, since the statement \"The splat is not quanked\" implies that it is not quanked. On the other hand, if the splat is morphed, then it is not quanked, since the statement \"The splat is not quanked\" implies that it is not quanked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
