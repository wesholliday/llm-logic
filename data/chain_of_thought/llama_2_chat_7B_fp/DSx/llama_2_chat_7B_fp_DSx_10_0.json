We need to use logical reasoning to determine whether we can infer \"The wug is sproinged\" from these statements.\n\nTo do this, we can use the law of excluded middle, which states that for any proposition P, either P is true or its negation \u00acP is true. In this case, we have two propositions: \"The wug is sproinged\" and \"The wug is not garpled\".\n\nSince \"The wug is not garpled\" is true, we can conclude that \"The wug is not sproinged\" (since sproinged implies garpled). Therefore, we can infer \"The wug is not sproinged\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
