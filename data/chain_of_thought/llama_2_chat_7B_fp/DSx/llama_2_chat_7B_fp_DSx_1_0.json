We need to use logical reasoning to determine whether we can infer \"The flugel is blimmed\" from these statements.\n\nThe statement \"Either the flugel is blimmed or it is zargled\" implies that there are only two possible states for the flugel: blimmed or zargled. If the flugel is not zargled, then it must be blimmed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer \"The flugel is blimmed\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
