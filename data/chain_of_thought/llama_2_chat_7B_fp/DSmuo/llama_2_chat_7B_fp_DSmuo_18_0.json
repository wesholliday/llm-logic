This rule allows us to draw a conclusion from two premises, one of which is a negation of the conclusion.\n\nThe premises given are:\n\n1. It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\n2. Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nFrom these premises, we can conclude that the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand. If the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand, then it must be in the drawer. Therefore, we can infer \"The notebook is in the drawer.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
