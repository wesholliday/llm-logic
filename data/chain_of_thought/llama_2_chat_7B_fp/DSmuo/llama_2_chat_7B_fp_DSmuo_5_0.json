This is because if the cookies must be hidden in the pantry, then they cannot be in the jar. However, the premise 'Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry' implies that the cookies can be in either the jar or the pantry, but not both. Therefore, we can conclude that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, and hence must be in the jar.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
