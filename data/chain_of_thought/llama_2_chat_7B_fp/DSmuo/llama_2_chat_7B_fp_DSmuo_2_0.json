This means that the book could be somewhere else, such as on the shelf.\n\nHowever, the second premise \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" tells us that if the book is not resting on the table, then it must be on the shelf. This is a logical implication of the premise, as the only other option is that the book is not on the shelf or resting on the table, which is contradictory.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
