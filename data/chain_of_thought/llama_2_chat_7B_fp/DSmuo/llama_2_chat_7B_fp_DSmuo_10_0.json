This is because the statement \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\" implies that the missing sock is not in that location.\n\nNow, let's consider the other premise: \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed.\" This statement implies that the missing sock is in one of those two locations. Since we have already established that the missing sock is not under the bed, the only possible location left is the laundry basket. Therefore, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
