This means that the pen could be somewhere else, such as in the bag.\n\nFrom \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk,\" we can conclude that the pen is either in the bag or on the desk. Since the pen is not necessarily on the desk, we can infer that it must be in the bag.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
