This means that there is a possibility that the watch is somewhere else, such as on a dresser.\n\nFrom the second premise, \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist,\" we can conclude that the watch is either charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist. Since we have already established that the watch is not necessarily on his wrist, we can conclude that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nTherefore, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
