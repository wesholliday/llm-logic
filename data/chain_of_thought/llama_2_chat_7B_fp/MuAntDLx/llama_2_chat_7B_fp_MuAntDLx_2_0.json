In this case, the two options are \"on the plonk\" and \"in the glorp\".\n\nTo infer that \"The flump must be on the plonk\", we need to use the logical rule of disjunctive syllogism, which states that if a statement is either A or B, and A is true, then B must also be true.\n\nApplying this rule to our statement, we can see that if \"The flump must be on the plonk or in the glorp\", and \"The flump must be on the plonk\", then \"The flump must be in the glorp\" cannot be true. Therefore, the only possible conclusion we can draw is \"The flump must be on the plonk\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
