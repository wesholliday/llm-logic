In other words, the statement is saying that the floob cannot be in neither the glorp nor the wibble.\n\nNow, if we want to infer that the floob must be in the glorp, we need to use the rule of inference known as modus ponens. This rule states that if a statement is true and another statement implies it, then the implied statement must also be true.\n\nSo, if we start with the premise that the floob must be in the glorp or on the wibble, and we know that the floob is not on the wibble, then we can infer that the floob must be in the glorp.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
