In other words, if Alex completed the race, it logically follows that Chris also completed the race.\n\nNow, let's consider the contrapositive statement: \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\" This statement is the negation of the original statement, where we swap the roles of Alex and Chris.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race, we need to evaluate the contrapositive statement. If the contrapositive statement is true, then we can infer that if Alex did not finish the race, Chris did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
