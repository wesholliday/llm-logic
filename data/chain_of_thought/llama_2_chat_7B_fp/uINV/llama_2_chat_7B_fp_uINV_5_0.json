Jeff played basketball.\n2. Amy played tennis.\n\nThe conclusion being inferred is:\n\nIf Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\n\nTo determine whether this inference is valid or not, we need to evaluate the argument using the rules of logic.\n\nThe argument is valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis, and if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis. This is a straightforward logical inference, and there is no contradictory evidence or assumptions that would make the inference invalid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
