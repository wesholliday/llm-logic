If the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is in the forest (premise 1)\n2. The griffin is not in the forest (premise 2)\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that if the griffin is not in the forest, then the unicorn is not in the forest. This is because the presence of the griffin in the forest implies the presence of the unicorn in the forest, and since the griffin is not in the forest, the unicorn is not in the forest either.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
