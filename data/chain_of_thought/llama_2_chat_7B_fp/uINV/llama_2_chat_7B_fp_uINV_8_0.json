This means that if the vampire is not awake, the mummy cannot be awake either.\n\nTo infer that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake, we need to use the contrapositive form of the argument. The contrapositive form of the argument is:\n\nIf the vampire is not awake, then the mummy is not awake.\n\nThis means that if the vampire is awake, the mummy must also be awake, and vice versa.
