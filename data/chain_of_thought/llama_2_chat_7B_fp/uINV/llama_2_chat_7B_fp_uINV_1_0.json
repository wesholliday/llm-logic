            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument being presented is a classic example of a logical deduction. The premise \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" implies that if one of the two individuals, Mary, was present at the wedding, then the other individual, Sue, was also present.\n\nNow, we are asked to infer whether if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding. To answer this question, we need to apply the same logic as before. If Mary was not at the wedding, then we can conclude that Sue was not at the wedding either, since the premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
