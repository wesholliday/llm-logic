This means that there is a direct relationship between the type of cake and the type of muffins. If the cake is not chocolate, then the muffins cannot be blueberry.\n\nTo infer whether the muffins were not blueberry if the cake was not chocolate, we need to consider the opposite premise: if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry. This means that if the cake is not chocolate, then the muffins cannot be blueberry, which is the same conclusion as before.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
