In other words, if Ben ate pasta, it is likely that Kate ate salad. However, this does not necessarily mean that if Ben did not eat pasta, Kate did not eat salad.\n\nThere are several possible scenarios where Ben did not eat pasta but Kate still ate salad:\n\n1. Ben ate something else for dinner that night.\n2. Ben was not hungry and did not eat anything.\n3. Ben was away from home and did not eat dinner at all.\n4. Kate ate salad for lunch or at a different meal.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Ben did not eat pasta, Kate did not eat salad without additional information.\n\nAnswer: No",
