In other words, if Sam took a plane, it led to Erin taking a train.\n\nTo infer that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train, we need to use the logical principle of non-contradiction. This principle states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nTherefore, if we assume that Sam did not take a plane, we can conclude that Erin did not take a train, because the causal relationship between Sam's action and Erin's action implies that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
