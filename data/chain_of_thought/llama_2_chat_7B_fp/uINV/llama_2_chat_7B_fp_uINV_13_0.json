            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument provided is a classic example of a logical deduction. It states that if the car was red, then the truck was blue, and vice versa. This means that if the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\n\nTo understand why this is true, let's break down the argument:\n\n* If the car was red, then the truck was blue. (Assumption 1)\n* If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue. (Conclusion)\n\nNow, let's evaluate the conclusion based on the assumptions:\n\n* If the car was red, then the truck was blue. (Assumption 1)\n* If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue. (Conclusion)\n\nSince the conclusion follows logically from the assumptions, we can infer that if the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
