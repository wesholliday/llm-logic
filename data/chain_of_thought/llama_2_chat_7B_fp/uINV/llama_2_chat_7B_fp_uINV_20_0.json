            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on the premise that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. This means that there is a direct relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana. If the apple is red, then the banana is yellow, and vice versa.\n\nNow, let's consider the opposite premise: if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow. This premise is also true by the same reasoning as before. If the apple is not red, then it cannot be yellow, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
