            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument presented is in the form of a logical argument, where the conclusion is drawn based on the premises provided. To determine the validity of the argument, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe premises of the argument are:\n\n1. If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n2. If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\nIf Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. Therefore, if Tom did not watch football, then the opposite must be true, i.e., Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nSo, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
