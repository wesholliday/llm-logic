To determine the validity of the argument, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe premises of the argument are:\n\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n2. If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\nIf Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. Therefore, if Joe did not go to the park, Lucy did not go to the zoo. This means that the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
