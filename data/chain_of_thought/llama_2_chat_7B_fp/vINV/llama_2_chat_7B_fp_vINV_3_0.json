The argument can be represented as:\n\nIf P (the book was written by James), then C (the book is a mystery novel)\nIf not P (the book was not written by James), then not C (the book is not a mystery novel)\n\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we need to evaluate the truth of the premise and the conclusion. If the premise is true, then the conclusion follows logically, and the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
