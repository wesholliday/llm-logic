            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument presented is in the form of a logical argument, where the premise and conclusion are related through a logical relationship. The premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow, and the conclusion states that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\n\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In other words, we need to check whether the conclusion can be deduced from the premise using logical reasoning.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the antecedent and consequent of the argument. The antecedent is the condition stated in the premise, and the consequent is the conclusion. In this case, the antecedent is \"If the apple was red,\" and the consequent is \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\"\n2. Determine whether the antecedent is true. If the antecedent is false, then the conclusion cannot be deduced. In this case, the premise states that the apple was red, so the antecedent is true.\n3. Determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the antecedent. If the conclusion does not logically follow from the antecedent, then the argument is not valid. In this case, the conclusion states that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow. Since the antecedent is true, the conclusion logically follows, and the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
