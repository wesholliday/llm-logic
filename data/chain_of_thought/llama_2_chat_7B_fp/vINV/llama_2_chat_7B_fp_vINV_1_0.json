            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument presented is in the form of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a type of argument that uses \"either-or\" statements to reach a conclusion. The argument is as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\nPremise 2: If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\nConclusion: If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate the conclusion based on the premises. In this case, the conclusion follows directly from the premises, as the \"either-or\" statements in the premises imply that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
