            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on a logical principle called \"modus ponens,\" which states that if A implies B, and A is true, then B must be true. In this case, the premise \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" implies that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nHowever, there is a problem with the argument. The premise \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is not necessarily true. It is possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, but Mark still bought the blue shirt for some other reason. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
