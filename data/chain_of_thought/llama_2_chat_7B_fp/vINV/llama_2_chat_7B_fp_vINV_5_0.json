            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument presented is in the form of a logical argument, where the premise and conclusion are related by a logical connection. The premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis, and the conclusion states that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\n\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In other words, we need to check whether the conclusion can be deduced from the premise using logical reasoning.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the antecedent and consequent of the argument. The antecedent is the condition stated in the premise, and the consequent is the conclusion. In this case, the antecedent is \"Jeff played basketball,\" and the consequent is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n2. Determine whether the antecedent is true. If the antecedent is false, then the conclusion cannot be deduced, and the argument is not valid.\n3. Evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the antecedent. If the conclusion does not logically follow from the antecedent, then the argument is not valid.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent is \"Jeff played basketball,\" and we need to determine whether the conclusion \"Amy played tennis\" logically follows from this premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premise because if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis, by definition. Playing basketball and playing tennis are mutually exclusive activities, so if Jeff played basketball, it is impossible for Amy to have played tennis. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.",
