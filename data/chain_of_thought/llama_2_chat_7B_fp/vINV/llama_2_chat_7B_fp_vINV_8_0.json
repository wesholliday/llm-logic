            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument presented is in the form of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a type of argument that uses a \"disjunction\" (or \"or\") to connect the premises. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\nPremise 2: The vampire was not awake.\nConclusion: Therefore, the mummy was not awake.\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate the conclusion based on the premises. In other words, we need to determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because the premises do not contradict each other, and the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake, regardless of the vampire's state. Therefore, the argument is valid.",
