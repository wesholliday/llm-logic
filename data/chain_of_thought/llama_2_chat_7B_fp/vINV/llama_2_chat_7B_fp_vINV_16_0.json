            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument presented is in the form of a conditional argument, where the conclusion follows from the premises if they are true. The premises are:\n\n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n2. If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\n\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument is logically valid if and only if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.\n\nTo evaluate the validity of the argument, we can use a truth table:\n\n| Premise 1 | Premise 2 | Conclusion |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| True | True | True |\n| True | False | False |\n| False | True | False |\n| False | False | False |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that the argument is logically valid. If either premise is true, then the conclusion must be true. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid.",
