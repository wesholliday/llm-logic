However, it does not necessarily mean that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nTo infer that the whiffle might not have been shanked, we would need additional information or evidence that suggests the whiffle was not shanked. Without this information, we cannot make that inference.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
