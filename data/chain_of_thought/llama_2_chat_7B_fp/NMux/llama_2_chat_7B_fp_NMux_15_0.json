The premise states that it is not the case that the dreb must have been vroombed. This means that the possibility of the dreb being vroombed is not mandatory or necessary.\n\nIn other words, the absence of the word \"must\" in the premise implies that the possibility of the dreb not being vroombed is not excluded. Therefore, we can infer that the dreb might not have been vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
