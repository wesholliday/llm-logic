This means that we cannot conclude that the smonk must have been vreebled based on this statement alone.\n\nTo infer that the smonk might not have been vreebled, we would need additional information or evidence that suggests the smonk was not vreebled. For example, if we know that the smonk was in a different location at the time of the vreebling, or if we have evidence that the vreebling occurred after the smonk's last known location, then we could infer that the smonk might not have been vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
