This premise is being used to draw an inference about the possibility of the splat not having been morphed.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'The splat might not have been morphed' from the given premise, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise 'It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed' can be interpreted as meaning that there is no necessary connection between the splat and morphing. This does not necessarily imply that the splat was not morphed, but rather that there is no logical requirement for it to have been morphed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premise, we cannot infer 'The splat might not have been morphed' with absolute certainty. However, we can say that it is possible that the splat was not morphed, given the absence of any necessary connection between the splat and morphing.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
