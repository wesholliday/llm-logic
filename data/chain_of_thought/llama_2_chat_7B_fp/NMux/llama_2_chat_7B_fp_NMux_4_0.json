In other words, the possibility of the fribble not being snurgled is not excluded.\n\nTo infer that the fribble might not have been snurgled, we can use the following argument:\n\n1. If the fribble must have been snurgled, then it is not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled.\n2. Therefore, the fribble might not have been snurgled.\n\nThis argument relies on the logical connection between the two premises, which is that if something must happen, then it is not the case that it must not happen.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
