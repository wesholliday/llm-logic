The movie might be sold out.\n\nTo infer whether the movie is playing and sold out at the cinema, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements.\n\nIf the movie is playing at the cinema, it means that it is being shown at the cinema. However, if it is sold out, it means that all the tickets for the movie have been sold, which implies that there are no more tickets available for the movie.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the movie is playing at the cinema, it is likely that it is sold out as well.
