            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nIn this argument, we are given two premises: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and \"The banana was yellow.\" We need to determine whether we can logically infer \"The apple was red\" from these premises.\n\nTo do this, we need to evaluate the argument using the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a disjunctive syllogism, which means that we need to consider both premises and determine which one is true.\n\nPremise 1: If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\nPremise 2: The banana was yellow.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that either the apple was red or the banana was yellow. Since the second premise states that the banana was yellow, we can conclude that the apple must have been red.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
