Modus ponens is a basic rule of logic that allows us to draw a conclusion from two premises, where the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nIn this case, the premises are \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" and \"Bob chose pasta\". Using modus ponens, we can conclude that if Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza.\n\nTherefore, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
