            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can logically infer \"The cake was chocolate\" from the given premises, we need to follow the logical structure of the argument. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This means that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry.\n\nNow, we know that the muffins were blueberry. So, we can ask ourselves, \"What can we infer from the fact that the muffins were blueberry?\" The answer is that we can infer that the cake was not blueberry. This is because the argument states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry, but since the muffins were blueberry, the cake cannot be blueberry. Therefore, we can logically infer that the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
