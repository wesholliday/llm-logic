            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nIn order to logically infer that Tom watched football based on the given premises, we need to use the logical connector \"therefore\" or \"so\". The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" implies that there is a causal relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball, where if Tom does something, then Jen will also do the same thing.\n\nHowever, the second premise \"Jen watched basketball\" does not provide any information about Tom's actions. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that Tom watched football based solely on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
