            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can logically infer \"Mary was at the wedding\" from the given premises, we need to use the rule of inference known as modus ponens. This rule allows us to draw a conclusion from two premises if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nIn this case, the premises are \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Sue was at the wedding.\" Using modus ponens, we can conclude that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding, since the premises are logically connected by the condition \"if-then.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can logically infer that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
