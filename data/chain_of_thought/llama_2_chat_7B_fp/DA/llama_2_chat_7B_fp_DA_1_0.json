            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on two premises: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" We need to use logical reasoning to determine if we can infer that Sue was not at the wedding based on these premises.\n\nThe argument is a form of modus tollens, which is a type of logical argument used to deduce a conclusion from two premises. The premises are:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (premise 1)\n2. Mary was not at the wedding (premise 2)\n\nThe conclusion we want to deduce is: Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nTo apply modus tollens, we need to evaluate the argument by asking ourselves if the premises are true, and if they lead to a valid conclusion.\n\nPremise 1 is a logical implication, which means that if the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequent (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true. This premise is true.\n\nPremise 2 is also true, as we are given that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nNow, we need to ask ourselves if the argument leads to a valid conclusion. If the argument is valid, then we can infer that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
