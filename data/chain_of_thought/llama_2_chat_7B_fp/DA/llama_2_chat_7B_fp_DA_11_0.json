            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on the premise \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This means that if the cake had a certain characteristic (chocolate), then the muffins also had a certain characteristic (blueberry). However, the premise \"The cake was not chocolate\" tells us that the cake did not have the characteristic of chocolate.\n\nNow, we need to infer the characteristic of the muffins based on the premise. If the cake did not have the characteristic of chocolate, then it is likely that the muffins did not have the characteristic of blueberry. Therefore, we can infer that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
