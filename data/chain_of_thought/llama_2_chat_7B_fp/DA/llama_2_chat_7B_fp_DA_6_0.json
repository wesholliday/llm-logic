Specifically, we can use the law of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nUsing this law, we can reason as follows:\n\n1. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. (Premise 1)\n2. Sue did not choose pizza. (Premise 2)\n3. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. (Premise 1)\n4. Sue did not choose pizza. (Premise 2)\n5. Bob did not choose pasta. (Conclusion)\n\nIn this argument, we have two statements: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" and \"Sue did not choose pizza.\" If the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true, since they are logically connected. However, we know that the first statement is false (Sue did not choose pizza), which means that the second statement is also false. Therefore, we can conclude that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
