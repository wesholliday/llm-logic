            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument provided is a classic example of a logical deduction problem. We are given two premises: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" and \"Alex did not finish the race.\" We need to use logical reasoning to deduce the conclusion whether Chris finished the race or not.\n\nTo do this, we can use the law of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time. Applying this law to the premises given, we can deduce that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race either.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
