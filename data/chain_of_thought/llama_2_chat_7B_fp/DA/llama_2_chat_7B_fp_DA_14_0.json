Therefore, we need to determine the logical conclusion that can be drawn from this new information.\n\nIf the bear was not in the cave, then it is possible that the wolf was not in the den. This is because the presence of the bear in the cave does not guarantee the presence of the wolf in the den. Therefore, we can infer that the wolf was not in the den.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
