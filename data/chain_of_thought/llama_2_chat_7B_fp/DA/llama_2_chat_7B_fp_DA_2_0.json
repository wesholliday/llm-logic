This law states that a statement and its negation cannot both be true.\n\nSo, if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest. This is because the griffin and the unicorn are mutually exclusive, meaning they cannot both be in the same location.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The unicorn was not in the forest\" from the premises given.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
