            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nIn this argument, we are given two premises: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and \"The car was not red.\" We need to use logical reasoning to determine whether we can infer \"The truck was not blue\" from these premises.\n\nTo do this, we need to evaluate the argument using the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a disjunctive syllogism, which means that we need to consider both premises and determine which conclusion follows logically.\n\nPremise 1: If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\nPremise 2: The car was not red.\n\nFrom these premises, we can conclude that the car was not blue, since if the car was red, then the truck would be blue, but since the car was not red, the truck cannot be blue. Therefore, the conclusion that follows logically is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
