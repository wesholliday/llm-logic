            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that Erin did not take a train based on the given premises, we need to use the law of non-contradiction. This law states that a statement and its negation cannot both be true.\n\nSo, if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train. This is because if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train, as taking a train is an alternative to taking a plane.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that Erin did not take a train.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
