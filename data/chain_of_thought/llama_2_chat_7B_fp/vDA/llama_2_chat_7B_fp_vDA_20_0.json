            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument presented is in the form of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion. The argument consists of three parts: the first premise, the second premise, and the conclusion.\n\nThe first premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. This premise is based on the assumption that there is a direct relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana.\n\nThe second premise states that the apple was not red. This premise is the basis for the conclusion, as it provides evidence that the apple does not have the property that would make the banana yellow.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate the conclusion based on the premises provided. In this case, since the second premise is true, the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
