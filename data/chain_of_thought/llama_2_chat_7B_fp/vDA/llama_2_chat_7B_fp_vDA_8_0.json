            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument presented is in the form of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a type of argument that uses a \"or\" statement to connect the premises. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\nPremise 2: The vampire was not awake.\nConclusion: The mummy was not awake.\n\nTo determine the validity of this argument, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the type of argument: The argument is a disjunctive syllogism, which means that the conclusion follows from either of the premises.\n2. Evaluate the premises: We need to determine whether the premises are true or false. If either of the premises is false, then the conclusion cannot be logically valid.\n3. Determine the validity of the argument: If both premises are true, and the conclusion logically follows from them, then the argument is valid. Otherwise, the argument is invalid.\n\nBased on the given premises, we can evaluate the argument as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\nThis premise is true.\n\nPremise 2: The vampire was not awake.\nThis premise is also true.\n\nConclusion: The mummy was not awake.\nSince both premises are true, and the conclusion logically follows from them, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
