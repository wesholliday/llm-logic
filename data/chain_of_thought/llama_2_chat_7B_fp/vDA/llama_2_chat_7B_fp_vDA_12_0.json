            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on two premises: 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' and 'Joe did not go to the park'. The conclusion drawn from these premises is 'Lucy did not go to the zoo'. To determine the validity of this argument, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. This means that if Joe's action (going to the park) triggers a specific response (Lucy going to the zoo), then Lucy's action (going to the zoo) must also be true.\n\nThe second premise states that Joe did not go to the park. This means that the triggering action (going to the park) did not occur, and therefore the response (Lucy going to the zoo) cannot occur either.\n\nBased on these premises, the conclusion that Lucy did not go to the zoo logically follows. If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo, as there is no triggering action to initiate the response.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
