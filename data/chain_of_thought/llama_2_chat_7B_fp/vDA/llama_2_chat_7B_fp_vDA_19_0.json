Tom did not watch football.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nIf the first premise is true, then if Tom watched football, Jen would have watched basketball. However, the second premise states that Tom did not watch football, which means that Jen did not watch basketball. Therefore, the conclusion that Jen did not watch basketball follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
