The argument is valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and it does in this case.\n\nThe first premise states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. This means that if Sue made a particular choice, Bob must have made the opposite choice.\n\nThe second premise states that Sue did not choose pizza. This means that Bob must have chosen pasta, since the premises state that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
