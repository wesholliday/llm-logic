            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on two premises: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" and \"Jeff did not play basketball.\" The conclusion drawn from these premises is \"Amy did not play tennis.\"\n\nTo determine the validity of this argument, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nIf Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis, means that if there is an instance where Jeff played basketball, then there is an instance where Amy played tennis. However, the second premise states that Jeff did not play basketball, which means that there is no instance where Jeff played basketball. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Amy played tennis.\n\nAnswer: No",
