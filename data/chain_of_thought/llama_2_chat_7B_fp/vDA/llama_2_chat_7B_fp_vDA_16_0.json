            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument presented is in the form of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion. The argument consists of three parts: the first premise, the second premise, and the conclusion.\n\nThe first premise states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. This premise is true, as it is possible for a shirt made of cotton to be paired with pants made of denim.\n\nThe second premise states that the shirt was not cotton. This premise is given, and it is assumed to be true for the purposes of the argument.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that the pants were not denim. This conclusion is drawn from the first premise and the second premise, as if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would have been denim, but since the shirt was not cotton, the pants cannot be denim.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion does logically follow from the premises, as the first premise establishes a conditional relationship between the shirt and pants, and the second premise provides evidence that the shirt is not cotton, which makes it impossible for the pants to be denim. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
