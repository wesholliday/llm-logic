This means that if the dog is not inside, then the cat cannot be outside.\n\nThe second premise states that the dog was not inside. This means that the cat cannot be outside, according to the first premise.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
