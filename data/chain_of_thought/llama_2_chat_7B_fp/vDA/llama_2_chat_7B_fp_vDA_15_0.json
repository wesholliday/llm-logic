This means that if Sam's action (taking a plane) leads to a certain outcome (Erin taking a train), then Erin's action (taking a train) must also lead to the same outcome.\n\nThe second premise states that Sam did not take a plane. This means that Sam's action (taking a plane) did not lead to the outcome (Erin taking a train) that the first premise states as a consequence.\n\nBased on these premises, the conclusion that Erin did not take a train logically follows. If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train, as the first premise states that the two actions are linked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
