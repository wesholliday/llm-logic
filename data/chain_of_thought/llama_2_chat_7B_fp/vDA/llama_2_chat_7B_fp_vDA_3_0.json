            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is in the form of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a type of argument that uses \"either-or\" statements to reach a conclusion. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\nPremise 2: The book was not written by James.\nConclusion: The book is not a mystery novel.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate the truth of the premises and the conclusion.\n\nPremise 1: If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\nThis premise is true. If the book was written by James, then it meets the definition of a mystery novel, which is a type of novel that involves a puzzle or problem that the protagonist must solve.\n\nPremise 2: The book was not written by James.\nThis premise is also true. If the book was not written by James, then it does not meet the definition of a mystery novel.\n\nConclusion: The book is not a mystery novel.\nThis conclusion follows logically from the premises, so the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
