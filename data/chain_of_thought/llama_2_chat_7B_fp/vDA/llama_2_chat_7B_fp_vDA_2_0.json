The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\nPremise 2: The griffin was not in the forest.\nConclusion: The unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate the conclusion based on the premises. In this case, the conclusion follows logically from the premises, so the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
