            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument presented is in the form of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion. The argument consists of three parts: the first premise, the second premise, and the conclusion.\n\nThe first premise states that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. This premise is not necessarily true, as there may be instances where the car is red and the truck is not blue.\n\nThe second premise states that the car was not red. This premise is true, as we are assuming that the car is not red.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that the truck was not blue. This conclusion follows logically from the first premise and the second premise, as if the car was not red, then the truck cannot be blue.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
