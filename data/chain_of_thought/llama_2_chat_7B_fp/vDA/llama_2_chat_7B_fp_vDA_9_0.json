            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on two premises: (1) If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt, and (2) Lisa did not buy the red shirt. The conclusion drawn from these premises is that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, we need to check whether the argument is logically valid.\n\nTo do this, we can use the truth table method. We will evaluate the argument by filling in the truth values of the premises and the conclusion and checking whether the argument is valid.\n\nPremise 1: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\n\nTruth value: Let's assume that Lisa did buy the red shirt (T)\n\nPremise 2: Lisa did not buy the red shirt\n\nTruth value: Let's assume that Lisa did not buy the red shirt (F)\n\nConclusion: Mark did not buy the blue shirt\n\nTruth value: If Lisa did not buy the red shirt (F), then Mark did not buy the blue shirt (T)\n\nBased on the truth table, we can see that the argument is valid. The conclusion logically follows from the premises, so the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
