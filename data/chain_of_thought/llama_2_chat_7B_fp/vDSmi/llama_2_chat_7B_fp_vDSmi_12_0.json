The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nEither the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet. (Premise 1)\nThe jacket might not be hanging in the closet. (Premise 2)\nTherefore, the jacket is draped over the chair. (Conclusion)\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate the conclusion based on the premises. In this case, the conclusion follows logically from the premises, so the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
