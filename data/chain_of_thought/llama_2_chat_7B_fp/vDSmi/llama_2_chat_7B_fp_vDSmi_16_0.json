The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nEither the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk (premise 1)\nThe pen might not be on my desk (premise 2)\nTherefore, the pen is in my bag (conclusion)\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion does logically follow from the premises.\n\nIf the premise \"The pen might not be on my desk\" is true, then the pen could be in the bag, and therefore the conclusion \"The pen is in my bag\" follows.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
