The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nEither P or Q\nP might not be the case\nTherefore, P is the case\n\nIn this case, the first premise \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack\" can be read as \"Either the scarf is in my backpack or it is not in my backpack.\" The second premise \"The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack\" can be read as \"It is possible that the scarf is not on the coat rack.\" The conclusion \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack\" follows logically from the first two premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
