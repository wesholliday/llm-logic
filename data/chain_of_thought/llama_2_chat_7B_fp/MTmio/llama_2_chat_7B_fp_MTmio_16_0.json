It only suggests that the pants might not have been denim, which means the shirt could have been made of any material.\n\nHowever, from the second statement, we can infer that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. This is because the statement uses the word \"must,\" which implies a logical necessity. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must be denim, since cotton and denim are mutually exclusive materials.\n\nNow, let's apply this reasoning to the given statements:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
