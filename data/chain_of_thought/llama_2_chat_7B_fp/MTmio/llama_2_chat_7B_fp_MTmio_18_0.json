Therefore, we cannot conclude that the truck was metal based on this statement alone.\n\nOn the other hand, if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. This means that if the doll was plastic, we can conclude that the truck was metal.\n\nNow, combining both statements, we can see that if the doll was plastic, the truck must have been metal, but if the truck might not have been metal, then we cannot conclude that the doll was plastic. Therefore, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic based on these statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
