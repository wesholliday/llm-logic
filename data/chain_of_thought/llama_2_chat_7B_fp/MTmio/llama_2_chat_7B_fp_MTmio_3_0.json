This is because the statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\" implies that if the book was written by James, it must be a mystery novel. However, the premise \"The book might not be a mystery novel\" suggests that the book may not have been written by James, which contradicts the previous statement. Therefore, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
