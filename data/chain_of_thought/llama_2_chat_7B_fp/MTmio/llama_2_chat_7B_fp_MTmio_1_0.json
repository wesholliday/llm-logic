            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument provided is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" It involves drawing a conclusion based on an if-then statement without properly considering the possibility of alternative scenarios.\n\nIn this case, the argument goes as follows:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\n2. Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n3. Therefore, Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nHowever, this argument is flawed because it assumes that just because Sue might not have been at the wedding, Mary must have been at the wedding. But there could be other reasons why Sue was not at the wedding, such as being sick or having a prior commitment, that have nothing to do with Mary's attendance.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding based on the given argument. The argument is invalid and should be rejected.\n\nAnswer: No.",
