A logical connection between clauses means that we can infer one clause from another.\n\nClause 1: \"The quazzle must be flibbit by zizz\"\nClause 2: \"The quazzle must be frazzle by flibbit\"\nClause 3: \"The quazzle must be flibbit by zizz\"\n\nFrom Clause 1 and Clause 3, we can infer that the quazzle must be flibbit by either zizz or flibbit. However, we cannot directly infer that the quazzle must be frazzle by flibbit from Clause 1 and Clause 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'no'. We cannot infer \"The quazzle must be frazzle by flibbit and be flibbit by zizz\" from the given statement.",
