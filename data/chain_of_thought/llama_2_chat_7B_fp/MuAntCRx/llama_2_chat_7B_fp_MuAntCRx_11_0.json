We are asked to infer whether \"The glorp must be snizzle and be flump\" can be inferred from the given statement.\n\nTo determine whether this inference is valid, we need to analyze the relationship between the words in the statement.\n\n\"Glorp\" and \"flump\" are two distinct words that do not have any obvious connection. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The glorp must be snizzle and be flump\" just based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
