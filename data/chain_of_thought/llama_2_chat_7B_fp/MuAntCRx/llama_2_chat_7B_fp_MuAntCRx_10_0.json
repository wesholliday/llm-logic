Based on the given statement, we can infer that \"flonk\" and \"gronk\" are likely to be nouns or adjectives that describe the zooble.\n\nSince we don't have any additional information about the zooble, we can't determine whether it is gronk or not. However, based on the premise \"The zooble must be flonk,\" we can infer that the zooble is flonk.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'The zooble must be gronk and be flonk' from 'The zooble must be flonk'?\" is \"no.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
