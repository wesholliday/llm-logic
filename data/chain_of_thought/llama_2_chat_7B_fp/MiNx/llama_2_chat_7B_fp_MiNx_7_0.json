This means that there is a possibility that the whiffle was not shanked, which in turn implies that it is not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked.\n\nTo put it simply, the argument is saying that just because the whiffle might not have been shanked, it does not necessarily follow that it must have been shanked. Therefore, the answer to the question is 'no'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
