If the fleeg might not have been bluttered, then it's possible that it must have been bluttered. However, if it's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered, then it's not possible that it must have been bluttered.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered\" from the premise \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
