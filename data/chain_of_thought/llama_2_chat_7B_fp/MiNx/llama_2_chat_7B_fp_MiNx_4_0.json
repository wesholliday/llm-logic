This is because the word \"might\" suggests a degree of uncertainty or possibility.\n\nTo infer that \"It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled\" from the sentence \"The fribble might not have been snurgled\" would be a non sequitur, as the second sentence does not logically follow from the first.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'no'.",
