This is because the word \"might\" suggests a degree of uncertainty or possibility.\n\nTo infer that \"It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed\" from the sentence \"The flugel might not have been blimmed\" would be a non sequitur, as the second sentence does not logically follow from the first. The first sentence only suggests that it is possible that the flugel was not blimmed, and does not provide any information about whether it must have been blimmed.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed'?\" is \"no\".",
