Just because the grommet wasn't sploffed doesn't mean it must have been sploffed. It's possible that the grommet wasn't sploffed for reasons unrelated to its state of being sploffed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that it's not the case that the grommet must have been sploffed based solely on the fact that it wasn't sploffed.\n\nAnswer: No",
