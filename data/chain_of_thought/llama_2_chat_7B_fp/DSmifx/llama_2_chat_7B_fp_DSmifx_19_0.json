Therefore, if the smonk is not plagued, it must be vreebled.\n\nHowever, the statement \"The smonk might not be plagued\" implies that there is a possibility that the smonk is not plagued. In this case, we cannot infer that the smonk is vreebled based solely on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
