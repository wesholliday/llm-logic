Just because the smip might not be lupped does not necessarily mean that it is shripped. There could be other reasons why the smip is not lupped, and shripping is just one possible explanation.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The smip is shripped\" from the given premises. The argument is invalid, and we cannot draw a conclusion based on it.\n\nAnswer: No",
