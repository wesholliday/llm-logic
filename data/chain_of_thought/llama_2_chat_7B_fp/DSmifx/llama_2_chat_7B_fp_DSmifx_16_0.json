However, the argument does not provide any evidence or reasoning to support the claim that the sneg is cramped simply because it might not be spread.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the sneg is cramped based solely on the argument provided. The argument is flawed and does not logically follow.\n\nAnswer: No",
