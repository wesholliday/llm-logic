To determine whether we can infer the conclusion from the condition, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the two.\n\nIn this case, the condition \"the book must have been on the shelf\" is a necessary condition for the conclusion \"the book must have had a red cover.\" This means that if the book was on the shelf, then it must have had a red cover. Therefore, we can infer the conclusion from the condition.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
