The use of \"and\" in the statement suggests that both clauses are related and contribute to the overall meaning.\n\nTo infer whether \"The exam must have been difficult\" from this statement, we need to consider the meaning of the phrase \"covered all chapters.\" If the exam covered all the chapters, it is likely that it was also difficult, as it would have required a thorough understanding of all the material. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is reasonable to infer that the exam was difficult.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
