            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer that the document must have been signed, we need to consider the context of the statement \"The document must have been signed and notarized.\" If the document has been notarized, it means that a notary public has verified the signature on the document, which implies that the signature is authentic and legally binding. Therefore, if the document has been notarized, it is likely that the document has also been signed.\n\nHowever, it is possible that the document was notarized without being signed. For example, a notary public may have verified the signature on a document without the signer being present, or the document may have been notarized after the signer's death. Therefore, while the fact that the document has been notarized suggests that the signature is authentic, it does not necessarily follow that the document must have been signed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
