This means that the envelope was not solely located in one of those two places, but rather it was in both locations.\n\nSince the statement implies that the envelope was in both upstairs and under a bed, we cannot infer that the envelope must have been upstairs. The statement does not provide enough information to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No",
