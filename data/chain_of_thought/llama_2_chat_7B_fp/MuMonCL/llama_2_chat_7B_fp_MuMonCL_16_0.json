            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument being made is that if the room was cleaned daily and had fresh towels, then it must have been cleaned daily. This is a logical inference based on the information provided.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the room must have been cleaned daily, we need to evaluate the information provided in the premise. The premise states that the room must have been cleaned daily and had fresh towels. This implies that the room was cleaned at some point in time, and that it had fresh towels at that time.\n\nSince the premise states that the room had fresh towels, it is reasonable to assume that the room was cleaned recently, as fresh towels are typically provided daily. Therefore, we can infer that the room must have been cleaned daily.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
