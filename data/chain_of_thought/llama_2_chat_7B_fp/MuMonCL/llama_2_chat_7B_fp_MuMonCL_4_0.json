From this information, we can infer that the meeting was held at 2 PM, but we cannot infer that it was held in the conference room.\n\nThe reason for this is that the statement only provides information about the time of the meeting and its location, but it does not provide any information about the duration of the meeting or any other details that might be relevant to determining whether the meeting was held in the conference room.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the meeting was held at 2 PM based solely on the information provided in the statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
