It is possible that the concert will only feature rock music, or only feature jazz music, or even something entirely different.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the concert will definitely feature both rock and jazz music. However, we can infer that the concert might feature either rock or jazz music, or neither.\n\nAnswer: No",
