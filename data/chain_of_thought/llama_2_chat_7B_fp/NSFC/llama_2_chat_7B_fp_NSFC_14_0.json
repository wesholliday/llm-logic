Therefore, we cannot infer that the company will definitely expand and downsize.\n\nHowever, we can infer that the company might expand or downsize, which means that there is a possibility that the company will expand or downsize. This inference is based on the fact that the sentence only provides two possibilities for the company's actions, but it does not rule out the possibility of the company taking any other action.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
