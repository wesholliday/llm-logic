It does not provide any information about the likelihood of one outcome over the other. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The team might win the match and the team might lose the match\" directly from the given statement.\n\nHowever, we can infer that the team's outcome is uncertain, and there is a possibility of both winning and losing. This is because the statement \"The team might win or lose the match\" implies that the team's outcome is not predetermined and can go either way.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
