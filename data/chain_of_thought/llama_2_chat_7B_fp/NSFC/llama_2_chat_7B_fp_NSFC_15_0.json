It does not explicitly state that the artist will paint both, but rather gives us a range of possibilities.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the artist might paint a landscape and the artist might paint a portrait, as both are within the range of possibilities suggested by the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
