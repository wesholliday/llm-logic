It does not provide any information about the probability of each outcome or the likelihood of one outcome over the other.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the athlete might win gold and the athlete might win silver. The statement only implies that there are two possible outcomes, but it does not provide any information about the likelihood of each outcome.\n\nAnswer: No",
