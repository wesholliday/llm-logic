In this case, we are given the statement \"The cat might be on the roof or in the garden.\" This statement implies that the cat could be in either the roof or the garden, but not both.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the statement \"The cat might be on the roof and the cat might be in the garden\" as a logical consequence of the given statement. This means that the cat could be both on the roof and in the garden, which is a possibility that is logically implied by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
