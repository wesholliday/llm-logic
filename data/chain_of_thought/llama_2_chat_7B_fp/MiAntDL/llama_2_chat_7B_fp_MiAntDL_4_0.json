            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe sentence \"The meeting might be at 2 PM or cancelled\" suggests that there is a possibility that the meeting might not take place at all. Therefore, we cannot infer that the meeting will definitely be at 2 PM.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the meeting is likely to take place, then we can infer that it will be at 2 PM. This is because the sentence only provides two possibilities for the time of the meeting: 2 PM or cancelled. Since the sentence does not provide any other times, we can infer that 2 PM is the most likely time for the meeting.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
