The statement \"The keys might be in the drawer or on the table\" implies that the keys could be in either of those two locations.\n\nTo infer the location of the keys, we need to analyze the information provided in the statement. Since the statement mentions two possible locations, we can infer that the keys might be in either the drawer or the table.
