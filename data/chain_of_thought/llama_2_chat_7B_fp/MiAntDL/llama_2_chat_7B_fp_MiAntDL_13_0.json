It does not directly imply that the movie is in English.\n\nTo infer that the movie is in English, we would need additional information or context that suggests it is more likely to be in English than subtitled. For example, if the movie is set in an English-speaking country or features predominantly English dialogue, it would be more likely to be in English.\n\nAnswer: No",
