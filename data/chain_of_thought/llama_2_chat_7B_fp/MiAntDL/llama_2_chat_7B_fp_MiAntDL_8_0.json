This could mean that the restaurant is closed on Mondays, or that it has limited hours of operation on that day.\n\nTo infer that the restaurant is closed on Mondays, we would need to know more information about the context in which the statement is being made. For example, if the statement is being made by the restaurant itself, it could be indicating that the restaurant is closed on Mondays. However, if the statement is being made by someone else, it could be suggesting that the restaurant has limited hours on Mondays, but not necessarily closed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
