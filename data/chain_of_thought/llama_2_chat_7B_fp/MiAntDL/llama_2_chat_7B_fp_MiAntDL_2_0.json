Since the statement does not provide any information about the book's location, we cannot infer that the book is definitely on the shelf.\n\nHowever, we can infer that the book might be on the shelf with a probability that is greater than zero. This is because the statement explicitly mentions the shelf as a possible location for the book, while it does not mention the library as a possible location. Therefore, the probability of the book being on the shelf is greater than the probability of it being in the library.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
