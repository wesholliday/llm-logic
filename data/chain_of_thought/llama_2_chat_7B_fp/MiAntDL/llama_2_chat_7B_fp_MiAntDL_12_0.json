On the other hand, the conclusion \"the project might be extended\" suggests that there is a possibility that the project will not be completed by Friday.\n\nSince the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the condition, we cannot infer \"The project might be completed by Friday\" from the given statement. Therefore, the answer is 'no'.",
