The phrase \"or notarized\" adds a possibility that the document could be notarized, which is a separate concept from being signed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we cannot infer that the document is definitely signed. However, we can infer that the document could be signed or notarized, depending on the context and additional information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
