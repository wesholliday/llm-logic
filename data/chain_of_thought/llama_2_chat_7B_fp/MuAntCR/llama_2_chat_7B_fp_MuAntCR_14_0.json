            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer that the contract must have been valid for a year and been renewable, we need to carefully analyze the information provided in the statement.\n\nThe statement mentions that the contract must have been renewable, which implies that the contract was initially valid for a certain period of time, which could be a year or any other duration. Therefore, we can conclude that the contract was valid for at least a year.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the contract is renewable suggests that it was not a one-time agreement, but rather a recurring one. This means that the contract was valid for multiple years, and the parties involved agreed to renew it on a regular basis.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
