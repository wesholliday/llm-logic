            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo infer that the document must have been signed and notarized, we need to understand the meaning of \"notarized\" and how it relates to the statement \"The document must have been notarized.\"\n\n\"Notarized\" means that a document has been signed in the presence of a notary public, who has verified the identity of the signer and witnessed the signing of the document. The notary public then affixes their seal or stamp to the document to authenticate it.\n\nTherefore, if the statement \"The document must have been notarized\" is true, it means that the document has been signed and notarized. In other words, the document has been signed by the person who is claimed to have signed it, and that person's identity has been verified by a notary public.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
