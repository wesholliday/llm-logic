It could be that the concert started at 8 PM due to a variety of reasons, such as the venue's schedule, the performers' availability, or the organizers' planning.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the concert was sold out based solely on the fact that it started at 8 PM. Additional information or context is needed to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
