However, it does not necessarily imply that the exam was difficult. It could be that the exam was easy and covered all the necessary material.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"The exam must have been difficult\" implies that the exam was challenging and required a lot of effort to complete. It does not necessarily imply that all chapters were covered.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The exam must have been difficult and covered all chapters\" solely based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
