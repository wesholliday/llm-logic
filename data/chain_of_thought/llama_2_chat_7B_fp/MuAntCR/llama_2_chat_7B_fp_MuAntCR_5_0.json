However, it does not necessarily imply that the package was delivered yesterday. It could have been delivered at any time after it was signed for.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The package must have been delivered yesterday and signed for\" solely based on the fact that the package was signed for.\n\nAnswer: No",
