Modus ponens is a valid argument form that allows us to draw a conclusion from two premises, if both premises are true.\n\nThe premises given in the question are:\n\n1. The newspaper isn't sitting on the porch.\n2. Either the newspaper is sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway.\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can infer the conclusion that if the newspaper isn't sitting on the porch, then it must be in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
