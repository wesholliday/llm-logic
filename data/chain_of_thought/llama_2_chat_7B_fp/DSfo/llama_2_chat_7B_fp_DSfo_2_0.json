            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The book is on the shelf\" from the given premises, we need to apply the law of non-contradiction. This law states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nFrom the first premise, \"The book isn't resting on the table,\" we can infer that the book is not in a state of resting on the table. This means that the book must be in a different state, such as being on the shelf.\n\nFrom the second premise, \"Either the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf,\" we can infer that the book is either resting on the table or it is on the shelf. Since the book is not resting on the table, it must be on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
