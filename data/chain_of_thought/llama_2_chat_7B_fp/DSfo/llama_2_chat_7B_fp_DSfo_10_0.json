In this case, the argument presents two options: either the missing sock is under the bed or it's in the laundry basket.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket, we need to evaluate the validity of the argument. A valid disjunctive syllogism requires that the two options presented are exclusive and that one of them must be true.\n\nIn this case, the argument does not provide any evidence to suggest that the missing sock is not under the bed. Therefore, we cannot infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket based solely on the argument provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
