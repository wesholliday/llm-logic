This means that the scarf must be in a different location.\n\nFrom the second premise, \"Either the scarf is draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack,\" we can conclude that the scarf is either on the coat rack or in the backpack. Since the scarf is not on the coat rack, it must be in the backpack.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
