If the sunglasses are not perched on the person's head, then they must be in a bag that belongs to the person.\n2. If the sunglasses are perched on the person's head, then they are not in a bag.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the sunglasses are in the person's bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
