The premise \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet\" is a negative statement, which means that the shoes might not be in the closet. The conclusion \"The shoes might not be in the closet\" is a logical extension of the premise, as it is a possible outcome given the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
