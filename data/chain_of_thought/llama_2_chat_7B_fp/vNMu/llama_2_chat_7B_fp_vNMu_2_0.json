Modus tollens is a form of argument that goes as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If A, then B.\nPremise 2: Not B.\nConclusion: Therefore, not A.\n\nIn this case, the premise \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\" can be interpreted as \"If the griffin must have been in the forest, then it was in the forest.\" The conclusion \"The griffin might not have been in the forest\" is then logically deduced from the premise \"Not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest.\"\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
