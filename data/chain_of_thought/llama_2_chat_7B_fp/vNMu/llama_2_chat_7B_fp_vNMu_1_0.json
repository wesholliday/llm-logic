            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a classic example of a valid argument, known as a modus tollens argument. Modus tollens is a type of argument that is used to deduce a conclusion from two premises, where the first premise is a negation of the conclusion, and the second premise is a statement of something that is known to be true.\n\nIn this case, the premise \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" can be interpreted as a negation of the conclusion \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\" The second premise is the statement \"Mary did not attend the wedding.\"\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can deduce the conclusion \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" from the two premises. This means that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
