Modus tollens is a form of argument that goes as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If A, then B.\nPremise 2: Not B.\nConclusion: Therefore, not A.\n\nIn this case, the premise 1 is \"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag,\" and the premise 2 is \"The pen might not be in my bag.\" If we assume that the premises are true, then the conclusion logically follows that the pen might not be in the bag.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
