Modus tollens is a form of argument that goes as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If A, then B.\nPremise 2: Not B.\nConclusion: Therefore, not A.\n\nIn this case, the premise is \"It's not the case that the vampire must have been awake\" and the conclusion is \"The vampire might not have been awake.\" If we assume that the premise is true, then we can conclude that the vampire might not have been awake, which is the conclusion of the argument.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
