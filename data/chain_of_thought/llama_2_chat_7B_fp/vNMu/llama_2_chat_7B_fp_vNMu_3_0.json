Modus tollens is a form of argument that goes as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If A, then B.\nPremise 2: Not B.\nConclusion: Therefore, not A.\n\nIn this case, the premise \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James\" can be interpreted as \"If the book was written by James, then it must have been written by James.\" The conclusion \"The book might not have been written by James\" is then logically deduced from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
