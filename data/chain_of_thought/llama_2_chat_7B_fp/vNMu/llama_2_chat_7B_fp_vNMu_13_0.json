Modus tollens is a form of argument that goes as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If A, then B.\nPremise 2: Not B.\nConclusion: Therefore, not A.\n\nIn this case, the premise \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" can be interpreted as \"If the toy is in the toy box, then it must be in the toy box.\" The conclusion \"The toy might not be in the toy box\" is then logically deduced from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
