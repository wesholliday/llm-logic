This could mean that the person took the medicine with their meal, or it could mean that they took it after finishing their meal. However, it does not necessarily imply that the medicine was taken on an empty stomach.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the medicine must have been taken on an empty stomach or with food. The information provided in the statement only suggests that the medicine was taken while the person was eating something, but does not provide any information about the timing of the meal or the state of the stomach.\n\nAnswer: No",
