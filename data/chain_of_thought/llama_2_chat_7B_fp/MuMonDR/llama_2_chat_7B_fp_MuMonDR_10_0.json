However, it does not necessarily imply that the document has been notarized or signed in the presence of a notary public.\n\nThere are several reasons why the document may have been signed without being notarized:\n\n1. The document may have been signed electronically, without the need for a physical signature.\n2. The document may have been signed in the presence of a witness, but not a notary public.\n3. The document may have been signed outside of a legal setting, such as a business agreement between two parties.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the document must have been notarized or signed just based on the fact that it must have been signed.\n\nAnswer: No",
