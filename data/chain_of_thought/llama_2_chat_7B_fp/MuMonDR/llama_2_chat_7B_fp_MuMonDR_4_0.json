However, it does not necessarily imply that the meeting actually took place at that time. It is possible that the meeting was cancelled or rescheduled for another time.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the meeting must have been cancelled or scheduled for 2 PM solely based on the fact that the meeting was scheduled for 2 PM. Additional information or context is needed to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
