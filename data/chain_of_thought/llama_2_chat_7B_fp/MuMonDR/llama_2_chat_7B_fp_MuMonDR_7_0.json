However, it does not necessarily imply that the exam was easy or difficult in general. It only suggests that the speaker perceives the exam as challenging.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the exam was easy or difficult based solely on the statement \"The exam must have been difficult.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
