However, it does not necessarily imply that the restaurant was open for limited hours or closed on Mondays.\n\nThe statement \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays\" is a logical conclusion based on the information provided, but it does not provide any information about the restaurant's hours of operation. It is possible that the restaurant was open for limited hours on other days of the week, but closed on Mondays.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The restaurant must have been open for limited hours or closed on Mondays\" solely based on the statement \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
