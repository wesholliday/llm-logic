            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"The event must have been formal\" implies that the event was of a high level of formality, which can be interpreted as either semi-formal or formal.\n\nTo infer that the event was semi-formal or formal, we can reason as follows:\n\n* Formal events are typically characterized by a high level of formality, such as black tie attire, a sit-down dinner, and a strict schedule.\n* Semi-formal events are less formal than formal events but still have some elements of formality, such as a dress code, a buffet or sit-down dinner, and some structure to the evening.\n\nBased on the information provided, it is possible that the event was either semi-formal or formal, but we cannot infer with certainty which one it was without additional context.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
