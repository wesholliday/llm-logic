However, it does not necessarily imply that the room was cleaned upon request or daily.\n\nThe statement \"The room must have been cleaned upon request\" implies that the room was cleaned when requested by someone. This could be a guest, a customer, or someone else who requested the room to be cleaned.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the room was cleaned upon request or daily based solely on the statement \"The room must have been cleaned daily.\" We need additional information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
