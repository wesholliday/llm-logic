However, it does not necessarily imply that the computer is definitely broken or that it is definitely working. It is possible that the computer is working but experiencing some issues or problems.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the computer is working or broken based solely on the statement \"The computer might be broken.\" It is possible that the computer is in a state of ambiguity, where it is neither working nor broken.\n\nAnswer: No",
