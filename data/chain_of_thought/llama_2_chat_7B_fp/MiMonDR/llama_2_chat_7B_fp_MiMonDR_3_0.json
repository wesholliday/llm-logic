Therefore, we cannot infer that the keys might be in the house or in the car based solely on the information provided in the statement.\n\nHowever, if we are given additional information or context, such as the fact that the person is looking for their keys and they were last seen in the house or the car, then we could infer that the keys might be in one of those locations.\n\nAnswer: No",
