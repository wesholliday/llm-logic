It simply states that the package might be delivered, without providing any additional context or information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the package might be delayed or delivered based solely on the sentence \"The package might be delivered.\" It is possible that the package could be delivered on time, or it could be delayed for various reasons.\n\nAnswer: No",
