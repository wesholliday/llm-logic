However, it does not necessarily imply that there is a possibility that the team will lose the game. In other words, the statement only provides evidence for the possibility of the team winning, but not for the possibility of the team losing.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The team might lose or win the game\" solely based on the statement \"The team might win the game.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
