The scarf is stuffed in your backpack: If the scarf is stuffed in your backpack, it is not draped on the coat rack, which means the second premise is true. Therefore, we can infer that the scarf is stuffed in your backpack.\n2. The scarf is not stuffed in your backpack: If the scarf is not stuffed in your backpack, it must be draped on the coat rack. However, we have already established that it's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack. Therefore, we can infer that the scarf is not draped on the coat rack.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
