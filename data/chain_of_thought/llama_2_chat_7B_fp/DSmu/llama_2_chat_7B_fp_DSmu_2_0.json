            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument provided is a classic example of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a type of argument that involves two exclusive possibilities. In this case, the argument states that either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table. However, the second premise states that it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'The book is on the shelf' from these premises, we need to consider the logical implications of each possibility. If the book is on the shelf, then it is not resting on the table, so the first premise is true. On the other hand, if the book must be resting on the table, then it is not on the shelf, so the second premise is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer 'The book is on the shelf' with certainty.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
