The pattern is as follows:\n\n* The first word ends in a consonant sound (g) followed by a vowel sound (o)\n* The second word ends in a vowel sound (o) followed by a consonant sound (b)\n* The third word ends in a consonant sound (b) followed by a vowel sound (o)\n\nUsing this pattern, we can infer the next word in the sequence as follows:\n\n* The fourth word ends in a consonant sound (b) followed by a vowel sound (o)\n* The fifth word ends in a vowel sound (o) followed by a consonant sound (w)\n* The sixth word ends in a consonant sound (w) followed by a vowel sound (o)\n\nTherefore, the complete sequence of words is:\n\nThe grooble might be in shimble and wobble zooble\n\nAnswer: Yes",
