The argument is:\n\nIf the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\nThe flug was not zimmed.\nTherefore, the flug was not blummed.\n\nHowever, this argument is invalid because the second premise does not necessarily imply the first premise. Just because the flug was not zimmed does not mean it was not blummed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the flug was not blummed based on the given premises. The argument is invalid, and we cannot make any conclusions about the blumming or zimming of the flug.\n\nAnswer: No.",
