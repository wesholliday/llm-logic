We need to use logical reasoning to infer whether we can conclude \"The whiffle was not shanked\" based on these statements.\n\nIf the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked, which means that if the whiffle was shanked, it would have tinked. However, the statement \"The whiffle did not tink\" tells us that the whiffle did not tink, which means that it was not shanked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can conclude that \"The whiffle was not shanked\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
