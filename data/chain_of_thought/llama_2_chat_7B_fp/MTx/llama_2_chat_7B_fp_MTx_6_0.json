We need to use logical reasoning to determine whether we can infer \"The grommet was not sploffed\" from these statements.\n\nTo do this, we need to analyze the relationship between the statements. If the first statement is true, then the second statement must be false, as the grommet did not plop the frink if it was not sploffed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The grommet was not sploffed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
