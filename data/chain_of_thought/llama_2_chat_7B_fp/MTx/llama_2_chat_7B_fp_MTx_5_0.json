            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statements are: \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\" and \"The zinger was not smoogled.\" We need to use logical reasoning to determine whether we can infer \"The zinger was not fraggled\" from these statements.\n\nThe first statement suggests that if the zinger is fraggled, then it is also smoogled. This means that if the zinger is in a certain state (fraggled), it must also be in another state (smoogled).\n\nThe second statement tells us that the zinger was not smoogled. This means that the zinger is not in the state of smoogling.\n\nNow, we need to use the first statement to deduce what we can infer about the zinger's state. If the zinger is fraggled, then it must also be smoogled, according to the first statement. Since the zinger was not smoogled, we can conclude that it was not fraggled either.\n\nTherefore, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
