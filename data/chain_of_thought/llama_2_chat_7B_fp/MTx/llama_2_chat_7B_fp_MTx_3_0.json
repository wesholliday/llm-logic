We need to use logical reasoning to determine whether we can infer \"The splat was not morphed\" from these statements.\n\nIf the splat was morphed, then it would have undergone a change in shape or form. Therefore, if the splat did not quank, it means that it did not undergo any change in shape or form. This implies that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
