            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statements are: \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" and \"The sneg did not sproted the frink\". We need to use logical reasoning to infer whether we can conclude \"The sneg was not crampled\" based on these statements.\n\nTo do this, we can use the logical rule of inference known as modus tollens. Modus tollens is a form of reasoning that allows us to draw a conclusion from two premises, one of which is a negation of the conclusion. In this case, the conclusion is \"The sneg was not crampled\" and the premise is \"The sneg did not sproted the frink\".\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer that if the sneg was not crampled, then it did not spring the frink. Since the second premise states that the sneg did not spring the frink, we can conclude that the sneg was not crampled. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
