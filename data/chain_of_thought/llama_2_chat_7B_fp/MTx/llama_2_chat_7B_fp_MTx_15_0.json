The dreb was not spened.\n\nWe need to use logical reasoning to infer whether we can conclude that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nTo do this, we can use the law of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nSo, if the dreb was vroombed, then it must have been spened. But, if the dreb was not spened, then it cannot have been vroombed.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
