However, it does not necessarily imply that the document has been notarized.\n\nA signed document can be either handwritten or printed, and it can be signed by anyone, including the person who created the document or someone else with authorization. Therefore, based solely on the statement \"The document must have been signed,\" we cannot infer that the document has been notarized.\n\nAnswer: No",
