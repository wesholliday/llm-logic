However, it does not necessarily imply that the restaurant served Italian cuisine. It could have been any type of restaurant, such as a bar, a caf\u00e9, or even a fast food joint.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the restaurant must have been closed on Monday and served Italian cuisine without additional information.\n\nAnswer: No",
