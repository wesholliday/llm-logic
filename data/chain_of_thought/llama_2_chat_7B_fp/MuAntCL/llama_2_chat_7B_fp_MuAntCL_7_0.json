However, it does not necessarily imply that the exam covered all chapters.\n\nFor example, the exam may have focused on a specific topic or section of the course, and may not have covered all the other chapters. Alternatively, the exam may have been designed to test the student's ability to apply their knowledge and understanding of the course material to complex problems or scenarios, rather than covering all the individual chapters.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the exam must have been difficult and covered all chapters without additional information.\n\nAnswer: No",
