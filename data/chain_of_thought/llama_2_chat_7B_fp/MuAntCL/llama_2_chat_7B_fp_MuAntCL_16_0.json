However, it does not necessarily imply that the room had fresh towels. The statement only mentions the cleanliness of the room, not the availability of towels.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the room must have had fresh towels based solely on the statement \"The room must have been cleaned daily.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
