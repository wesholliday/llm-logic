The premise and conclusion of the argument are mutually exclusive, meaning that they cannot both be true.\n\nThe premise \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly\" implies that the room was not cleaned to a satisfactory level. However, the conclusion \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\" implies that the room was cleaned, which contradicts the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid, as it leads to a logical contradiction.\n\nAnswer: No",
