A logical contradiction occurs when the premises of an argument lead to two or more conclusions that cannot both be true. In this case, the argument's premise and conclusion are mutually exclusive, meaning that if the issue was discussed in depth, it could not have been discussed.\n\nTo see why this is the case, consider the argument's premise: \"If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth.\" This means that if the issue was discussed, it was not discussed to a sufficient degree. Now, the argument's conclusion states that \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed.\" This means that if the issue was discussed in depth, it was not discussed at all.\n\nThese two statements are logically incompatible, as it is possible for an issue to be discussed both in depth and to a sufficient degree. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
