The premise \"If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently\" implies that studying and diligence are mutually exclusive, which is not necessarily true. It is possible for someone to study diligently without studying at all, or to study without being diligent. Therefore, the conclusion \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study\" cannot be logically deduced from the premise.\n\nAnswer: No",
