However, the conclusion, \"If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served,\" implies that the customer was served. These two statements cannot both be true, as they are logically contradictory.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid, and it cannot be used to draw a conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No",
