            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is in the form of a disjunctive syllogism, which means that it is either-or argument. The premise \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice\" implies that either the advice given was not helpful or no advice was given. The conclusion \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered\" implies that if the advice given was helpful, then it was not advice given.\n\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we need to evaluate whether the premises lead logically to the conclusion. In this case, the argument is logically valid because the premises do lead to the conclusion. If the advice given was not helpful, then it was not advice given, which means that the conclusion \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
