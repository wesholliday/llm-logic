In this case, the argument assumes that just because instructions were not explained clearly, it follows that they were not given. However, this conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise, as there could be other reasons why instructions were not explained clearly, such as a lack of information or a mistake in the communication process.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid, as it does not provide sufficient evidence to support its conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No",
