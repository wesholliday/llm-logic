If the plim is grobbled, then the whiffle will sploosh.\n2. If the drazzle is drooped, then the plim is grobbled.\n\nWe need to use the second premise to infer the conclusion. If the drazzle is drooped, then the plim is grobbled, which means that the premise 1 is true. Therefore, we can conclude that if the plim is grobbled and the drazzle is drooped, then the whiffle will sploosh.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
