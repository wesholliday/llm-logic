To determine whether we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to analyze the relationships between the words.\n\nIn the first statement, \"frizzle\" is related to \"dinked,\" and \"zarp\" is related to \"splunk.\" This suggests that if the \"frizzle\" is \"dinked,\" then the \"zarp\" will \"splunk.\"\n\nIn the second statement, \"frizzle\" is related to \"dinked\" and \"sklonk\" is related to \"grooped.\" However, there is no direct relationship between \"sklonk\" and \"zarp.\" Therefore, we cannot directly infer that if the \"frizzle\" is \"dinked\" and the \"sklonk\" is \"grooped,\" then the \"zarp\" will \"splunk.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
