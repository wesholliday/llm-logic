To determine whether we can infer the second statement, we need to evaluate the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe first premise, \"the tizzer is on,\" implies that a certain condition is met, which in turn implies that a specific outcome will occur. The second premise, \"the plink light is out,\" provides additional information that is relevant to the outcome. Based on this information, we can infer that if the tizzer is on and the plink light is out, then the goom is snurpled.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
