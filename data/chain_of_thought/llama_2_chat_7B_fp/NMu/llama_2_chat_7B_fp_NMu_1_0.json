However, it does not necessarily follow that Mary might not have been at the wedding.\n\nTo make the inference that Mary might not have been at the wedding, we would need additional information or evidence that suggests Mary was not present at the wedding. For example, if we know that Mary was not in the area where the wedding took place, or if we have reason to believe that she was not invited to the wedding, then we could infer that she might not have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No",
