In this case, the argument is:\n\nIt's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest.\n\nFrom this argument, we can infer that the griffin might not have been in the forest. This is because if it were the case that the griffin must have been in the forest, then it would be impossible for the griffin not to have been in the forest. However, since it is not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest, it is possible that the griffin might not have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
