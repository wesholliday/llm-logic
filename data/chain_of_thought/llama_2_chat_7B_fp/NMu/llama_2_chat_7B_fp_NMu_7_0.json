In other words, it is possible that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nTo infer that Alex might not have finished the race, we can use the following reasoning:\n\n1. If Alex must have finished the race, then he did finish the race.\n2. It is not the case that Alex must have finished the race (according to the given statement).\n3. Therefore, Alex might not have finished the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
