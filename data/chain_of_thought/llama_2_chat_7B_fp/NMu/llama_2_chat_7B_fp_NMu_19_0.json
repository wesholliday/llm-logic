In this case, the argument is that the watch must not be charging on the dresser, which implies that the watch might not be charging on the dresser.\n\nTo make this inference, we are relying on the fact that the watch must not be charging on the dresser, which is a logical contradiction. If the watch must not be charging on the dresser, then it must be charging somewhere else. Therefore, we can infer that the watch might not be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
