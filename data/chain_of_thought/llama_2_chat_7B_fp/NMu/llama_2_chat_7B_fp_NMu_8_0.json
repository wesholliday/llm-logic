In this case, the argument is that the vampire must not have been awake, which implies that the vampire might not have been awake.\n\nTo make this inference, we are relying on the fact that the vampire must not have been awake, which is a logical contradiction if the vampire was awake. Therefore, we can infer that the vampire might not have been awake, as there is no other possible explanation for why the vampire must not have been awake if it was awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
