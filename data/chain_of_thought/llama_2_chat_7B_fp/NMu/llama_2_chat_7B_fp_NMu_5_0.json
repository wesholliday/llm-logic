It does not necessarily imply that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nTo infer that Jeff might not have played basketball, we would need additional information or context. For example, if we know that Jeff is not a basketball player, then we can infer that he might not have played basketball. However, without additional information, we cannot make that inference based solely on the statement \"It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
