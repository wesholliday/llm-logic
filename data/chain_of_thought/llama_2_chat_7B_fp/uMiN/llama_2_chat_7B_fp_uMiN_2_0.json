The question states that the griffin might not have been in the forest, which implies that there is a possibility that the griffin could have been in the forest. However, the question does not provide any additional information that would suggest that the griffin was definitely not in the forest.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer with certainty that the griffin must have been in the forest. The possibility of the griffin being in the forest remains a possibility, and we cannot rule it out without additional evidence.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
