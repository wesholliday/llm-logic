The question states that Sue might not have chosen pizza, which implies that there is a possibility that Sue did choose pizza. However, the question also states that we can infer that it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza, which suggests that there is evidence or reasoning that suggests it's unlikely that Sue chose pizza.\n\nTo answer the question, we need to evaluate the evidence and reasoning provided in the question to determine the likelihood that Sue chose pizza. If the evidence and reasoning suggest that it's unlikely that Sue chose pizza, then we can infer that it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
