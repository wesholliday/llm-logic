The question states that the notebook might not be in the drawer, which implies that the notebook could be in another location. However, it does not provide any information that suggests the notebook is definitely not in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot conclude that the notebook must not be in the drawer. It is possible that the notebook is in the drawer, and we cannot make any definitive statements about its location without additional information.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
