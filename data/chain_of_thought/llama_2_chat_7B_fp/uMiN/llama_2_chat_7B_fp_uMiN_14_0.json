The statement says that the milk might not be on the counter, which implies that there is a possibility that the milk is not on the counter. However, it does not necessarily mean that the milk must not be on the counter.\n\nThere are several possible scenarios:\n\n1. The milk might be on the counter, but not visible due to its location or the position of the counter.\n2. The milk might be in the refrigerator or another location in the kitchen.\n3. The milk might not be in the kitchen at all, but rather in another room or in a different location altogether.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that it is not the case that the milk must be on the counter without further information.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
