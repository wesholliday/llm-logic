The question states that Alex might not have finished the race, which implies that there is a possibility that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nIf we assume that Alex did not finish the race, then we can infer that it's not the case that Alex must have finished the race. This is because the statement \"Alex must have finished the race\" implies that it is impossible for Alex not to have finished the race, but since we know that Alex might not have finished the race, we can conclude that it's not the case that Alex must have finished the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
