The question states that the toy might not be in the toy box, which implies that the toy could be in another location. However, it does not provide any information that would lead us to conclude that the toy must not be in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the toy must not be in the toy box. The toy could be in the toy box, or it could be in another location altogether.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
