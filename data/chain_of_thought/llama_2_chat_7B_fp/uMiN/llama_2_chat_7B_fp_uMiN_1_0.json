The question states that Mary might not have been at the wedding, which implies that there is a possibility that Mary was not present at the wedding.\n\nHowever, just because Mary might not have been at the wedding, it does not necessarily mean that she must have been at the wedding. The statement \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" does not imply a logical contradiction, as there are many possible scenarios in which Mary could have been absent from the wedding without necessarily meaning that she was definitely present.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that it is not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding solely based on the information provided in the question.\n\nAnswer: No",
