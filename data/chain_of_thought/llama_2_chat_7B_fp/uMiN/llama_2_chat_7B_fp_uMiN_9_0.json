The question states that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt, which implies that there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nIf we assume that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then we can infer that it is not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt. This is because the phrase \"must have\" implies a necessity or obligation, and if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then it is not necessary or obligatory that she did so.\n\nTherefore, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
