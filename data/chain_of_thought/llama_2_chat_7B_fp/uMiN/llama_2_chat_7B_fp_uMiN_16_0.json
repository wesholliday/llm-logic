However, simply knowing that the pen might not be in my bag does not allow us to conclude that it must not be in my bag.\n\nTo make this inference, we would need to know more information about the situation, such as the location of the pen and the likelihood that it is in my bag. For example, if the pen is in a location where it is unlikely to be in my bag, such as on a desk or in a drawer, then we could infer that it is not in my bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
