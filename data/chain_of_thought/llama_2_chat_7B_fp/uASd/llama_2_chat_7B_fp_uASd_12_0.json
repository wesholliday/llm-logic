However, the additional condition \"my computer catches on fire\" does not logically follow from the original statement. In other words, finishing homework does not guarantee that a computer will catch on fire.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if I finish my homework and my computer catches on fire, I can play video games. The two events are not related, and the additional condition does not provide any logical connection between them.\n\nAnswer: No",
