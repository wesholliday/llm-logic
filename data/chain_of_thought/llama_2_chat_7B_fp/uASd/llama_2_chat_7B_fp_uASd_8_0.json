However, if the package was misrouted, it may not arrive on the original delivery date.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the package has shipped and was misrouted, it will arrive today. The misrouting of the package may cause it to be delivered on a different day than the original delivery date.\n\nAnswer: No",
