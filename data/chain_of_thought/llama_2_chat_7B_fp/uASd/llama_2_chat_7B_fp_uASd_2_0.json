However, it does not guarantee that having a good time will occur.\n\nIn the second statement, \"If a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time,\" we are introducing an unlikely and dangerous scenario. Even if we go to the concert, there is no guarantee that a bomb will not go off, and it is highly unlikely that we will have a good time in that situation.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if a bomb goes off at the concert, we will have a good time. The two statements are not logically connected, and the second statement introduces an unrelated and dangerous scenario.\n\nAnswer: No",
