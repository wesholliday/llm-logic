However, it does not necessarily imply that getting enough sleep will prevent all forms of tiredness or exhaustion.\n\nFor example, if you get enough sleep but are also physically exerting yourself through hard labor, you may still feel tired or exhausted due to the physical demands of the labor. In this case, getting enough sleep may not necessarily prevent you from feeling tired.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired. It is possible to feel tired or exhausted even if you get enough sleep, depending on the specific circumstances.\n\nAnswer: No",
