However, this statement does not necessarily imply that if the item is out of stock, it will ship.\n\nThe reason for this is that the statement only mentions the relationship between the placement of an order and the shipment of the item, but it does not provide any information about what happens when the item is out of stock. It is possible that the company has a different process in place for handling out-of-stock items, such as notifying the customer or offering a substitute product.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the order is placed and the item is out of stock, it will ship. It is possible that the item will not ship in this scenario.\n\nAnswer: No",
