However, this statement is not necessarily true, as there may be other factors that could compromise the safety of the car, such as structural damage to the garage or the presence of hazardous materials.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the garage is flooding, the car is safe simply based on the fact that it is in the garage. The flooding could still pose a risk to the car's safety, even if it is inside the garage.\n\nAnswer: No",
