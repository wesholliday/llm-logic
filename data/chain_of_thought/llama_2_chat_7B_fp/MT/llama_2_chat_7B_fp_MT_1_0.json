            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding based on the given premises, we need to use the rule of inference known as modus tollens. Modus tollens is a form of reasoning that allows us to draw a conclusion from two premises, one of which is a negation of the conclusion.\n\nIn this case, the premises are:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (premise 1)\n2. Sue was not at the wedding (premise 2)\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding if we assume that the negation of the conclusion (i.e., Mary was not at the wedding) is true.\n\nTherefore, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
