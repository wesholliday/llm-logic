            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nIn this argument, we are given two premises: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" and \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" We need to use logical reasoning to determine whether we can infer \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" from these premises.\n\nTo do this, we can use the law of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time. If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, since the argument states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. Therefore, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
