            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on the premise that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This means that if Tom engaged in an activity (watching football), then Jen also engaged in an activity (watching basketball).\n\nNow, we are given that Jen did not watch basketball. This means that Jen did not engage in the activity of watching basketball.\n\nSince Tom and Jen are the only two entities involved in this argument, and we know that Jen did not watch basketball, we can conclude that Tom did not watch football either.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
