            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The griffin was not in the forest\" from the given statements, we need to apply the law of non-contradiction. This law states that a proposition and its negation cannot both be true.\n\nIn this case, we have two statements: \"The griffin was in the forest\" and \"The unicorn was not in the forest.\" If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest, which means that the negation of \"The griffin was in the forest\" is true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The griffin was not in the forest\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
