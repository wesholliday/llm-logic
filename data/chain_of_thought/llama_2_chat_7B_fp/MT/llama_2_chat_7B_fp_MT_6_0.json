This rule states that if a conclusion follows from two premises, and one of the premises is false, then the conclusion cannot be true.\n\nApplying this rule to our situation, we can see that if Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza (by the given premise). However, we are also given that Bob did not choose pasta. Therefore, we can use modus tollens to conclude that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
