This statement implies that if the shirt is made of cotton, then the pants must be made of denim.\n\nThe pants were not denim. This statement tells us that the pants are not made of denim, which means that they cannot be the pants described in the first statement.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the information provided in the second statement allows us to infer that the shirt was not cotton. Since the pants are not denim, it means that they are not the pants described in the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
