            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nIn this argument, we are given two premises: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\" and \"Kate did not eat the salad.\" We need to use logical reasoning to determine whether we can infer \"Ben did not eat pasta\" from these premises.\n\nTo do this, we can use the law of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time. If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta, since if Ben ate pasta, Kate would have eaten the salad. Therefore, we can infer \"Ben did not eat pasta\" from the premises given.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
