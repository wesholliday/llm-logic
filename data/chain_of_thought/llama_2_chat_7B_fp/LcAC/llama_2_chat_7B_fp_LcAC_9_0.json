            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can logically conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt based on the given premises, we need to use the rule of inference known as modus ponens. Modus ponens is a basic rule of logic that allows us to draw a conclusion from two premises, if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nIn this case, the premises are \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" and \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" Using modus ponens, we can conclude that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
