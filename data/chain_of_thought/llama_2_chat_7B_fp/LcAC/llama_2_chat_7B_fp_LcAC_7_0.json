This rule allows us to draw a conclusion from two premises, provided that the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nIn this case, the premises are \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" and \"Chris finished the race.\" Using modus ponens, we can conclude that if Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race.\n\nTherefore, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
