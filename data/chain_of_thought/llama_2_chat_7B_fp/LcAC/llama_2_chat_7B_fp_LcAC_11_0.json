The argument is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This means that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry.\n\nNow, we know that the muffins were blueberry. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement to the given premise. If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake must have been chocolate.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
