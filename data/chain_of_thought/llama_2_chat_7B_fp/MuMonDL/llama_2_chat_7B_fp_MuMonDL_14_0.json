However, it does not necessarily imply that the contract was valid for a year or longer.\n\nFor example, if the contract was valid for exactly one year, then the statement \"The contract must have been valid for a year\" would be true, but it would not imply that the contract was valid for a year or longer.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The contract must have been valid for a year or longer\" solely from the fact that the contract was valid for a year.\n\nAnswer: No",
