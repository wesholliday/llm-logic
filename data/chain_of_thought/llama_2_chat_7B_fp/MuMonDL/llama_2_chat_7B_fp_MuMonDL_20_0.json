            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"The event must have been formal\" implies that the event was of a serious and dignified nature, but it does not necessarily imply that the event was formal or black-tie. The term \"formal\" can refer to a wide range of events, including business meetings, weddings, and galas, among others.\n\nOn the other hand, \"black-tie\" is a specific type of formal event that typically involves men wearing tuxedos and women wearing evening gowns. Therefore, while \"formal\" does not necessarily imply \"black-tie,\" the two terms are not mutually exclusive.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
