It's possible that the exam was difficult but still manageable for the person taking it.\n\nTo infer that the exam must have been difficult or challenging, we would need more context or information about the exam and the person taking it. For example, if the person taking the exam is known to be struggling with the subject matter or has a history of poor performance in exams, then it's more likely that the exam was difficult or challenging for them.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
