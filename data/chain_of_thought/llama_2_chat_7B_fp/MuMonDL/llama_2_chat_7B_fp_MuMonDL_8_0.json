However, it does not necessarily imply that the restaurant had limited hours. It could simply mean that the restaurant was closed every Monday, without any implication of limited hours.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays or had limited hours\" solely based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
