However, it does not necessarily imply that the password contained special characters.\n\nThe statement \"The password must have been eight characters long or contained special characters\" would imply that the password had to meet both conditions: it had to be eight characters long, and it had to contain special characters.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the password must have contained special characters.
