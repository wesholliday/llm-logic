However, this statement does not necessarily imply that the flight was rescheduled. It is possible that the flight was simply delayed without being rescheduled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The flight must have been delayed or rescheduled\" solely based on the premise \"The flight must have been delayed.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
