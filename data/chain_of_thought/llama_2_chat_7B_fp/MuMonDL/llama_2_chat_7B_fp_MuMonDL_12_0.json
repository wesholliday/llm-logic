However, it does not provide any information about when the project must be completed after Friday. It could be completed on Friday, or it could be completed next week, or any other time.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the project must have been completed by Friday or next week. The statement only provides information about the deadline for completing the project, which is Friday, and does not provide any information about the duration of the project.\n\nAnswer: No",
