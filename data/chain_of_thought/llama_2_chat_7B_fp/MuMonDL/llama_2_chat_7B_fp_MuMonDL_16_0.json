However, it does not necessarily imply that the room was cleaned daily or as requested. The statement only implies that the room was cleaned at some point during the day, without specifying whether it was cleaned at a specific time or as per a request.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the room must have been cleaned daily or as requested from the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: No",
