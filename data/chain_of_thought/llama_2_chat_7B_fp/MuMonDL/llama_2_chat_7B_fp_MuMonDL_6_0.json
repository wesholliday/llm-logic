            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"The concert must have been sold out\" implies that the concert was completely sold out, meaning that every available ticket was purchased. However, it does not necessarily imply that there were no limited tickets available. It's possible that the concert had a limited number of tickets available, but all of them were sold out.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the concert must have been sold out or had limited tickets based solely on the fact that it was sold out. We need more information to determine whether the concert had limited tickets available.\n\nAnswer: No",
