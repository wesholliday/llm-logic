However, it does not necessarily imply that the application was submitted electronically. It could have been submitted through a third-party online platform, such as a government website, or it could have been submitted through a company's own online portal.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the application must have been completed online or submitted electronically. It is possible that the application was submitted through other means, such as by mail or in person.\n\nAnswer: No",
