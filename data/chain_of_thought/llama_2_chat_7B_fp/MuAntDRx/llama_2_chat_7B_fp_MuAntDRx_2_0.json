The words \"wozzle\" and \"plimp\" are homophones, with \"wozzle\" being a made-up word and \"plimp\" being a real word that means a small boat or ship.\n\nTo infer the location of the wozzle based on the statement, we need to consider the context and the meaning of the words used. In this case, the statement \"The wozzle must be on the blimp or in the plimp\" implies that the wozzle could be either on the blimp or inside the plimp.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'The wozzle must be in the plimp'?\" is yes.",
