In this case, the argument states that either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box. However, the second premise states that it's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the toy is in the toy box, we need to apply the rules of logic.
