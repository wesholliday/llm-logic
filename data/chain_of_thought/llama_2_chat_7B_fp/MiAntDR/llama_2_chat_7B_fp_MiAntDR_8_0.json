If the restaurant is closed on Mondays, then it is not open on that day.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"The restaurant might be open for limited hours\" implies that the restaurant has limited operating hours, but it does not necessarily imply that the restaurant is closed on any specific day of the week.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer that the restaurant is open for limited hours with absolute certainty. However, we can infer that the restaurant might be open for limited hours, as the statement provides a possibility or a chance that the restaurant is open during limited hours.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
