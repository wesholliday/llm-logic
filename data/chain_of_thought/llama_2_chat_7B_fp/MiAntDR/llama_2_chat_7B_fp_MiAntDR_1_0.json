Since the statement does not provide any information that would suggest the envelope is definitely located in one place and not the other, we cannot infer that the envelope is definitely located upstairs.\n\nHowever, we can infer that the envelope might be located upstairs, as the statement does not rule out the possibility that it could be located in that location. Therefore, the answer is 'yes'.",
