            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe sentence \"The meeting might be at 2 PM or cancelled\" suggests that there are two possible outcomes for the meeting: it might be held at 2 PM, or it might be cancelled. This implies that the meeting is not guaranteed to take place, and there is a possibility that it will not happen.\n\nTo infer that the meeting might be cancelled, we can use the information provided in the sentence. If the meeting might be at 2 PM or cancelled, then it is possible that it will be cancelled. However, it is also possible that the meeting will take place at 2 PM, so we cannot say with certainty that it will be cancelled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
