Since the statement does not provide any information about the likelihood of each scenario, we cannot infer that the concert is definitely postponed.\n\nHowever, we can infer that the concert might be postponed, as the statement explicitly mentions the possibility of postponement. Therefore, the answer is 'yes'.",
