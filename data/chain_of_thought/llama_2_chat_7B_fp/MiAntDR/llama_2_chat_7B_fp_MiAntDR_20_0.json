This means that we cannot directly infer that the event is semi-formal based solely on the fact that it could be either formal or semi-formal.\n\nHowever, we can use logical reasoning to narrow down the possible options. Since the event could be formal, it is possible that it is semi-formal as well. Therefore, the answer to the question is 'yes'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
