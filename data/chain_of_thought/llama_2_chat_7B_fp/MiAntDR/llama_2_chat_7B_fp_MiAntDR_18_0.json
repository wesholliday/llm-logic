This implies that the medicine can be taken in both situations, and it does not provide any information that suggests it cannot be taken on an empty stomach.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the sentence, we cannot infer that the medicine cannot be taken on an empty stomach. The sentence simply provides two options for taking the medicine, without ruling out any other possibilities.\n\nAnswer: No",
