It does not explicitly state that the room will be cleaned upon request, but it does provide two possible options for when the room might be cleaned.\n\nTo infer that the room might be cleaned upon request, we would need to rely on the context of the sentence and the information provided. However, without additional information, it is not possible to determine with certainty whether the room will be cleaned upon request.\n\nAnswer: No",
