The phrase \"might yield\" suggests a possibility or an uncertainty about the outcome of the experiment. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The experiment might yield groundbreaking results\" as a direct conclusion from the given sentence.\n\nHowever, we can infer that the experiment has the potential to be successful and produce important results, which is implied by the phrase \"groundbreaking results.\" This inference is based on the idea that if the experiment is successful, it could lead to significant discoveries or advancements in the field.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
