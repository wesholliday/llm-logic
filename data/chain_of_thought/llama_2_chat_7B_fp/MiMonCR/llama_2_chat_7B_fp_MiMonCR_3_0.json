However, the phrase \"and have subtitles\" does provide a connection between the two statements.\n\nIf we assume that the movie is critically acclaimed, it is possible that the movie has subtitles. This is because many critically acclaimed movies often have subtitles to help convey the story or to provide additional context to the audience.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the movie might have subtitles.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
