This could be the case if the researcher was not actively searching for the discovery, but rather was exploring a different area of research and stumbled upon it accidentally.\n\nHowever, just because the discovery was made accidentally does not mean that it will not lead to a Nobel Prize. The Nobel Prizes are awarded to individuals or organizations who have made outstanding contributions in their field, and the discovery of a new element could certainly be considered an outstanding contribution.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
