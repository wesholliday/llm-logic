However, it does not directly imply that the book will be adapted into a movie. The two events are not necessarily connected, as a bestseller can be successful without being adapted into a movie, and a movie can be successful without being based on a bestseller.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The book might be adapted into a movie\" solely based on the fact that \"The book might be a bestseller.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
