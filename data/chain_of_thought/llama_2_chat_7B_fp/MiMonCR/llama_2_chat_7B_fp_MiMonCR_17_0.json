To infer that the performance might feature guest artists, we need to consider the context of the sentence and the meaning of the words used.\n\nIn this case, the phrase \"and feature guest artists\" suggests that the performance might include guest artists, who are not necessarily part of the regular cast or crew. The use of the word \"feature\" implies that these guest artists will have a significant role in the performance, rather than just making a cameo appearance.\n\nTherefore, based on the context and meaning of the words used, we can infer that the performance might feature guest artists.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
