The word \"might\" implies a degree of uncertainty or possibility, rather than a definitive statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the investment definitely offers high returns. The sentence only suggests that there is a possibility that it could, but it is not a certainty.\n\nAnswer: No",
