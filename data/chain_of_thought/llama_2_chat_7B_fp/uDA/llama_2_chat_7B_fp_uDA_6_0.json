To do this, we can use the logical rule of inference known as \"modus tollens.\" This rule states that if A implies B, and A is false, then B must be false.\n\nApplying this rule to the situation, we can see that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. But since Sue did not choose pizza, we can conclude that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nTherefore, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
