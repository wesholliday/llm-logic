In this case, the argument states that either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The whiffle is shanked\" from the given argument, we need to evaluate the two alternatives presented.\n\nAlternative 1: The whiffle is shanked.\n\nIf the whiffle is shanked, then it cannot be tinked. Therefore, we can conclude that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAlternative 2: The whiffle must be tinked.\n\nIf the whiffle must be tinked, then it cannot be shanked. Therefore, we can conclude that the whiffle must be tinked.\n\nNow, let's answer the question:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
