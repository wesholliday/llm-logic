The first premise states that it is not the case that the grommet must be plopped, which means that the grommet cannot be plopped. The second premise states that either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped, which means that if the grommet is not sploffed, it must be plopped.\n\nNow, if the grommet is not sploffed, then it must be plopped. Therefore, the conclusion that can be drawn is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
