The first premise states that it's not the case that the flob must be moved, and the second premise states that either the flob is skizzled or it must be moved.\n\nSince the flob must be either skizzled or moved, and it's not the case that it must be moved, then it must be skizzled. Therefore, the answer is 'yes'.",
