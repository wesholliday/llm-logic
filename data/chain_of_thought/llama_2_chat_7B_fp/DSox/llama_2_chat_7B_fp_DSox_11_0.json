However, we cannot directly infer that the flug is blummed based on these statements alone.\n\nThe reason is that the statements only provide a negation of the word \"zimmed\" and do not provide any information about the word \"blummed.\" Therefore, we cannot conclude that the flug is blummed based solely on these statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
