Since the premises do not provide any information about the scarf being on the coat rack, we can conclude that it is not draped on the coat rack.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise: \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack.\" This premise implies that if the scarf is not draped on the coat rack, then it must be stuffed in the backpack.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
