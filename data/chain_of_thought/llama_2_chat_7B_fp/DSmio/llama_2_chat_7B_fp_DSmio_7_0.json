Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the umbrella is not in the closet. This is because if the umbrella were in the closet, it would have to be tucked away, but the statement \"The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet\" implies that it is not in the closet. Therefore, the only possible location for the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
