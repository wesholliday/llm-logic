In this case, the argument states that either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'Fido is inside' from this argument, we need to evaluate the two possibilities presented: either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\n\nIf Fido is inside, then it is not in the garden, so the first possibility is true. Therefore, we can infer 'Fido is inside'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
