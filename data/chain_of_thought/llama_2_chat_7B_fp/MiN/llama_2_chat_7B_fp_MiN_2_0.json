This means that we cannot infer that \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\" based solely on the given statement.\n\nIn other words, the statement \"The griffin might not have been in the forest\" does not provide enough information to conclude that the griffin must have been elsewhere. It's possible that the griffin could have been in the forest, even if it's not explicitly stated.\n\nAnswer: No",
