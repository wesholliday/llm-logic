This possibility does not necessarily mean that the pen must not be in the bag, but rather that it is possible that it is not there.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag\" solely based on the statement \"The pen might not be in my bag\". The statement \"The pen might not be in my bag\" only implies that the pen might not be in the speaker's bag, but does not rule out the possibility that it is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: No",
