It does not necessarily imply that the jacket must not be draped over the chair.\n\nTo infer that it's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair, we would need additional information or evidence that suggests that the jacket cannot be draped over the chair. Without such information, we cannot make that inference.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
