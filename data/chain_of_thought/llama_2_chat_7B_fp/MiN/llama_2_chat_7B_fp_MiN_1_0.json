It does not necessarily imply that Mary must have been at the wedding. In other words, the absence of evidence that Mary was at the wedding does not necessarily mean that she must have been there.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" solely based on the fact that Mary might not have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No",
