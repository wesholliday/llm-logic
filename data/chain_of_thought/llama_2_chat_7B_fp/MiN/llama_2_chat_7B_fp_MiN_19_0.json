This possibility does not necessarily mean that it is not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nIn other words, the statement \"The watch might not be charging on the dresser\" does not logically entail \"It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\" Both statements are true, but they refer to different things. The first statement refers to a possibility, while the second statement refers to a necessity.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser'?\" is \"no.\" We cannot infer that conclusion directly from the given statement.",
