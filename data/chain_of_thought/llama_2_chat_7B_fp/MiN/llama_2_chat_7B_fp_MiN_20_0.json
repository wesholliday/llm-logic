It does not necessarily mean that the sunglasses are definitely not in the bag.\n\nTo infer that \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag,\" we would need additional information or evidence that suggests with certainty that the sunglasses are not in the bag. For example, if we know that the person left their sunglasses at home or that they were last seen without them, then we could infer that they are not in the bag.\n\nAnswer: No",
