This is a valid logical inference, as the two entities are somehow related or connected.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\" This conclusion can be inferred based on the premise, as if the vampire is not awake, then the mummy must also not be awake, by the same logical reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
