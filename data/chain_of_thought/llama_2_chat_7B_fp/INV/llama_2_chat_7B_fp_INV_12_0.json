Using this law, we can deduce the conclusion from the premises as follows:\n\nIf Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo (premise 1)\nIf Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo (premise 2)\n\nBy using the law of non-contradiction, we can deduce that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo, and if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo. Therefore, the conclusion \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\" can be inferred from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
