            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument being presented is a logical deduction, where the conclusion is drawn based on the premise that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This means that if there is a situation where Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis either.\n\nTo infer that Amy did not play tennis if Jeff did not play basketball, we need to reverse the premise and conclusion. In other words, we need to ask ourselves what would happen if Jeff did not play basketball.
