            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument being presented is a logical deduction based on the premise \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This premise is a logical equivalence, meaning that if the apple has a certain property (red), then the banana must also have a certain property (yellow).\n\nTo apply this equivalence to a new situation, we can substitute a new object for the apple. For example, if we were to say \"If the orange was green, then the banana was yellow,\" we can use the same logical deduction to infer that \"If the orange was not green, then the banana was not yellow.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the premise \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,\" we can infer \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
