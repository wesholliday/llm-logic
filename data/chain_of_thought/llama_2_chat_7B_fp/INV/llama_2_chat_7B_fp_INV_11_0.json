            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument being presented is a logical deduction based on the premise that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. This means that if the cake had a certain characteristic (chocolate), then the muffins also had a certain characteristic (blueberry).\n\nTo apply this logic to the second premise, we can ask ourselves, \"If the cake was not chocolate, then what was it?\" If the cake was not chocolate, then it must have had a different characteristic. Therefore, if the cake had a different characteristic, the muffins must also have had a different characteristic.\n\nIn other words, if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
