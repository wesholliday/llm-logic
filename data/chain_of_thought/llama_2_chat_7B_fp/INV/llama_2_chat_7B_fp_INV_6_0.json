Specifically, it suggests that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nNow, let's consider the contrapositive of this statement: \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\" This statement is true if and only if the original statement is true. In other words, if Bob did not choose pasta, then we cannot infer that Sue chose pizza.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta'?\" is \"no\". We cannot infer that Bob did not choose pasta just because Sue did not choose pizza.",
