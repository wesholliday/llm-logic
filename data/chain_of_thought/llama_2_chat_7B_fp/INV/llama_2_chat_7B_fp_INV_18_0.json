            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument being presented is a logical deduction based on the premise \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This means that if the doll has a certain property (being plastic), then the truck also has a certain property (being metal).\n\nTo apply this logic to the second premise, we can ask ourselves, \"If the doll was not plastic, then what was it?\" The answer could be anything, such as \"It was wooden.\"\n\nNow, if we assume that the doll was not plastic, we can use the same logic as before to deduce that the truck was not metal. This is because if the doll was not plastic, then it must have been something else, such as wooden. Therefore, if the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
