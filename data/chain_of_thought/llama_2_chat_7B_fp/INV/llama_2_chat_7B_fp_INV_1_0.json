            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument being presented is a classic example of a logical deduction, where we are trying to infer a conclusion based on two premises. The premises are:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n2. Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nTo determine if we can infer the conclusion, we need to evaluate the argument using the rules of logical deduction.\n\nThe argument form is:\n\nIf A, then B.\nNot A, therefore not B.\n\nThis is a valid argument form, which means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the premises provided, we can infer the conclusion:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
