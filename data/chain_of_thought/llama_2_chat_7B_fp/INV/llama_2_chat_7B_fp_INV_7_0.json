In this case, the premise is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the face.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race,\" we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nIf Alex did not finish the race, it does not necessarily mean that Chris did not finish the face. There could be other factors at play, such as Chris not participating in the race or not having a face to finish. Therefore, we cannot infer that Chris did not finish the race just because Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: No",
