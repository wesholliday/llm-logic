This means that if the book was not written by James, then it cannot be a mystery novel.\n\nTo infer that if the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel, we can use the same logical reasoning as before. If the book was not written by James, then it cannot be a mystery novel, as James is the author who wrote the book. Therefore, the answer is 'yes'.",
