            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer the second statement from the first statement, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement, \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,\" implies that if the shirt is made of cotton, then the pants must be made of denim. This is a direct causal relationship, where the material of the shirt directly affects the material of the pants.\n\nThe second statement, \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim,\" is a logical conclusion that can be drawn from the first statement. If the shirt is not made of cotton, then it cannot be denim. Therefore, if the shirt is not cotton, we can infer that the pants are not denim.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
