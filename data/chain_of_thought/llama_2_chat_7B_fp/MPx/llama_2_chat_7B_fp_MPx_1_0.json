The principle of non-contradiction states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nIn this case, if the flugel was blimmed, then it is impossible for it to be zargled, as blimming and zargling are mutually exclusive. Therefore, if the flugel was blimmed, we can infer that it was not zargled.\n\nAnswer: No",
