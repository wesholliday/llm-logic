If the second statement is true, then the conditional statement is also true, and we can infer that the flug was zimmed.\n\nSo, let's evaluate the second statement: \"The flug was blummed.\"\n\nIf the flug was blummed, then it was not zimmed. Therefore, the second statement is false.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAnswer: No",
