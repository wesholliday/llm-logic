To determine if we can infer \"spened\" from \"vroombed\", we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nSince \"vroombed\" is a premise, it implies that the dreb was in a certain state. Therefore, if the dreb was in that state, it must have been spened. In other words, the conclusion \"spened\" logically follows from the premise \"vroombed\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
