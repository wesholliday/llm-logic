In this case, \"flooped\" and \"bimmed\" are the key words.\n\n\"Flooped\" means the opposite of what we would expect, i.e., it means \"was not flooped.\" So, if we are given the statement \"The wug was flooped,\" it means that the wug was not flooped.\n\n\"Bimmed\" is a verb that means \"to bim.\" Bim is a fictional object or concept in this language, and \"to bim\" means to perform an action on or with something.\n\nNow, let's apply these meanings to the given statement: \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n\nIf the wug was not flooped (i.e., it was flooped), then the wug did not bim the zoint. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
