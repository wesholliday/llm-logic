The whiffle was shanked.\n\nWe need to determine whether we can infer the statement \"The whiffle tinked\" from the given statements.\n\nTo do this, we can use the logical connector \"if-then\" to create a conditional statement:\n\nIf the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\n\nSince we are given that the whiffle was shanked in statement 2, we can use the conditional statement to infer that the whiffle tinked:\n\nAnswer: yes",
