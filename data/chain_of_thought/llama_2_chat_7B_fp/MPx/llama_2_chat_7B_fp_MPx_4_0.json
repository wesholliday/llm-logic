The fribble was snurgled.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'The fribble crinked' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical relationship between them.\n\nThe statement 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked' implies a causal relationship between the two events. If the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinkled. Therefore, if we know that the fribble was snurgled, we can infer that it crinkled.\n\nNow, let's apply this reasoning to the given statements:\n\nSince 'The fribble was snurgled' is true, we can infer that the fribble was snurgled.\n\nTherefore, by applying the logical relationship between the two events, we can infer that the fribble crinked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
