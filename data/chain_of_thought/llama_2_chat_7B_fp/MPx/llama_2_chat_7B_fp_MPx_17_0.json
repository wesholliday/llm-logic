If the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true, since \"skizzling\" is a verb that implies a change in the flob's state. Therefore, if the flob was skizzled, it must have moved.\n\nSo, based on the given statements, we can infer \"The flob movated\" as a conclusion.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
