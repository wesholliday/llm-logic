However, this is not always the case.\n\nIn this particular argument, the premises are:\n\n1. The fribble must be crinkled.\n2. It's not the case that the fribble must be crinkled.\n\nFrom these premises, we cannot infer that the fribble is snurgled. The reason is that the second premise simply states that the fribble does not have to be crinkled, which does not necessarily imply that it is snurgled.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'The fribble is snurgled'?\" is \"No.\"",
