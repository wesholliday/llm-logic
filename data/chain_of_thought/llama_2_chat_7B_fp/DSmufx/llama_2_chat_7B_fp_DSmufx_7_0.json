The argument states that it's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked, which means that the only remaining possibility is that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nTo infer the conclusion that the whiffle is shanked, we need to consider the logical implications of the premises. If the whiffle must be tinked, then it cannot be shanked. Therefore, if it is not the case that the whiffle must be tinked, then the only possible explanation is that it is shanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
