            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument provided is a classic example of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a type of argument that involves two exclusive possibilities. In this case, the argument states that either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked. If the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked.\n\nNow, we are asked to infer whether the sprocket is cranked based on the premise \"It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled.\"\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the logical implications of the premise. If the sprocket must be daggled, then it cannot be cranked. Therefore, if the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked.\n\nSo, based on the premise and the logical implications, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
