If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nTo infer whether 'The unicorn was in the forest' from these statements, we need to use the logical rule of inference known as modus ponens. This rule states that if A implies B, and A is true, then B must be true.\n\nSo, let's apply this rule to the given statements:\n\n1. The griffin was in the forest. (A)\n2. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. (B)\n\nSince A is true (the griffin was in the forest), we can infer that B is also true (the unicorn was in the forest). Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
