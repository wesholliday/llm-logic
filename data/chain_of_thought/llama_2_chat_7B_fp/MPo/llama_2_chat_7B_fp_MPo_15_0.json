In this case, the premises are \"Sam took a plane\" and \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"Erin took a train,\" we need to evaluate the argument based on the given premises.\n\nThe first premise \"Sam took a plane\" implies that Sam traveled by plane.
