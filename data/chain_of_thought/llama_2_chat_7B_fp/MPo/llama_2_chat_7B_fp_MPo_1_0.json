            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument being presented is a classic example of a logical deduction, where we are trying to infer the truth of a statement based on two premises. The premises are:\n\n1. Mary was at the wedding.\n2. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'Sue was at the wedding' from these premises, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nIf the premises are true, then the conclusion logically follows. In this case, we know that Mary was at the wedding, and if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. Therefore, we can infer that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
