            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nIn this situation, we have two premises: \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" We want to use these premises to make an inference about what Mark bought.\n\nTo do this, we need to use the logical connector \"then\" to link the two premises together. This connector indicates that if the first premise is true, the second premise must also be true. In other words, if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the first premise is true. If it is, then we can conclude that Mark bought the blue shirt. In other words, if Lisa bought the red shirt, then we can infer that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
