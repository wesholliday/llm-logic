This means that if the condition that Alex finished the race is true, then the condition that Chris finished the race is also true.\n\nNow, we are asked to infer whether Chris finished the race based on the premise that Alex finished the race. To do this, we need to apply the logical rule of inference known as modus ponens. This rule states that if A implies B, and A is true, then B must be true.\n\nApplying this rule to the argument, we can deduce that if Alex finished the race (A), then Chris finished the race (B), since A implies B. Therefore, based on the premise that Alex finished the race, we can infer that Chris finished the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
