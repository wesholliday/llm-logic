The sentence is structured as \"if...then,\" which implies that there are two possible outcomes: the exam might be difficult or it might be easy.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The exam might be difficult or it might be easy\" from the given sentence. The sentence only suggests that the exam could be either difficult or easy, but does not provide any information about the actual outcome.\n\nAnswer: No",
