The sentence does not provide any information that would allow us to infer that the book might be in only one of these locations. In other words, the sentence does not provide any logical constraints that would limit the possible locations of the book to only one of the two options.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the sentence, we cannot infer that the book might be in only one of the two locations. The sentence allows for the possibility that the book could be in either location, or perhaps in neither location.\n\nAnswer: No",
