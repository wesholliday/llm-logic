The first independent clause is \"The restaurant might be closed on Mondays,\" and the second independent clause is \"or it might be open for limited hours.\"\n\nTo infer the meaning of the sentence, we need to consider the context in which it is used and the relationships between the words. In this case, the sentence is used to describe the possibility that the restaurant may not be open on Mondays, or that it may have limited hours of operation.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sentence means \"The restaurant might be closed on Mondays or it might have limited hours.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
