It does not provide any information about the exact time of delivery or the probability of delivery on a specific day.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The package might be delivered today or it might be delivered tomorrow\" from the given sentence. The sentence simply states that the package could be delivered on either day, without providing any additional information about the timing of delivery.\n\nAnswer: No",
