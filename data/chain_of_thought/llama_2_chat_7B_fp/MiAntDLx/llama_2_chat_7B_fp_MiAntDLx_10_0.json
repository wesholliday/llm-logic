For example, \"The wozzle might be shimble\" follows the pattern of replacing \"wozzle\" with \"shimble\".\n\nTo answer the question, we need to determine if the pattern can be applied to the entire sentence. In this case, the sentence \"The wozzle might be shimble or flibbit\" suggests that the pattern can be applied to the entire sentence.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the wozzle might be shimble.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
