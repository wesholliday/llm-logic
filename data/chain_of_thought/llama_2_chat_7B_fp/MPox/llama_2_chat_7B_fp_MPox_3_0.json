If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\n\nTo infer whether 'The splat quanked' can be inferred from the given statements, we need to follow the logical flow of the statements.\n\nIf the first statement 'The splat was morphed' is true, then we can conclude that the splat underwent a transformation.\n\nThe second statement 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked' implies that if the splat underwent a transformation, then it quanked.\n\nTherefore, if the first statement is true, we can conclude that the splat quanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
