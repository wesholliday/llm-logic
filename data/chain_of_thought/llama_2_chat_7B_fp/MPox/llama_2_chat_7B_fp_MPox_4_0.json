If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\n\nTo infer whether 'The fribble crinked' can be deduced from the given statements, we need to follow the logical flow of the statements.\n\nIf the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\n\nThis means that if the fribble was in a certain state (snurgled), then it must be in another state (crinked).\n\nNow, we are given that the fribble was snurgled.\n\nTherefore, using the logical flow of the statements, we can infer that the fribble crinked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
