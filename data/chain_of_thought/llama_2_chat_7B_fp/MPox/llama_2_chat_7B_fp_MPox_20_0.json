If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n\nTo infer whether we can conclude \"The fleeg surned\" from these statements, we need to analyze the logical relationship between them.\n\nThe first statement \"The fleeg was bluttered\" provides no information about the fleeg's current state or whether it surned. It simply states that the fleeg was in a particular state in the past.\n\nThe second statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" implies a causal relationship between the two events. If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have surned.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot directly conclude \"The fleeg surned\" without additional information. However, we can infer that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have surned.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
