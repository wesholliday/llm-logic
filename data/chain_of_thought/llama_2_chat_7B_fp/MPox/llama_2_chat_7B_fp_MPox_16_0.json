If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nTo infer whether 'The sneg sproted the frink' can be deduced from the given statements, we need to follow the logical flow of the second statement.\n\nIf the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nIn this case, the sneg was crampled, which means that it was compressed or crushed. Now, we need to determine whether this compression or crushing of the sneg leads to it sprouting or propagating.\n\nSince the second statement states that if the sneg was crampled, then it sproted the frink, we can infer that the compression or crushing of the sneg does indeed lead to its sprouting or propagation. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
