If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\n\nTo infer whether 'The smonk plagged' can be deduced from the given statements, we need to follow the logical flow of the statements.\n\nIf the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged (according to the second statement).\n\nSo, if we start with the first statement, 'The smonk was vreebled', we can conclude that the smonk was vreebled.\n\nNow, if the smonk was vreebled, we can apply the second statement and conclude that the smonk plagged.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
