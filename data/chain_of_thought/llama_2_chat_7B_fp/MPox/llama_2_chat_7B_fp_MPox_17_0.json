If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\n\nTo infer whether 'The flob movated' can be deduced from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical relationship between them.\n\nThe first statement, 'The flob was skizzled,' provides no information about the flob's movement. It simply states that the flob was skizzled, which could mean anything.\n\nThe second statement, 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated,' implies a causal relationship between the flob being skizzled and the flob moving. If the flob is skizzled, then it must move.\n\nNow, we need to combine these two statements to see if we can infer 'The flob movated' from them. If we assume that the first statement is true (i.e., the flob was skizzled), then we can logically deduce that the second statement is also true (i.e., the flob movated). Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
