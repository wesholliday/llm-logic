If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\n\nTo infer whether 'The clug snugged' can be deduced from the given statements, we need to follow the logical flow of the second statement. If the first statement is true, then the second statement is also true, since 'was fleeked' implies 'is fleeked'. Therefore, we can move from the first statement to the second statement and conclude that 'The clug snugged' if the first statement is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
