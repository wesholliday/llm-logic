This means that if the smonk had the property of being vreebled, it would have also had the property of plagging.\n\nNow, we are given the additional information that the smonk plagged. This means that the smonk had the property of plagging, which we can infer from the premise.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the smonk was vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
