We need to determine whether we can infer \"The splat was morphed\" from these statements.\n\nTo do this, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements. \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" implies that if the splat was morphed, it would quank. On the other hand, \"The splat quanked\" simply states that the splat quanked, without providing any information about whether it was morphed or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer \"The splat was morphed\" from \"The splat quanked\". The quanking of the splat does not provide any information about its morphed state.\n\nAnswer: No",
