Therefore, if the grommet plopped the frink, it must have been sploffed first.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement: \"The grommet plopped the frink.\" This statement does not provide any information about the grommet's state before plopping the frink. It only tells us that the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that we cannot infer \"The grommet was sploffed\" from the given statements. The second statement does not provide any information about the grommet's state before plopping the frink, and therefore, we cannot deduce that it was sploffed.\n\nAnswer: No.",
