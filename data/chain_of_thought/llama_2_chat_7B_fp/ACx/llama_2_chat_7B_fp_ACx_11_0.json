The argument is:\n\nIf the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\nThe flug was zimmed.\nTherefore, the flug was blummed.\n\nHowever, this argument is invalid because the second premise does not necessarily imply the first premise. Just because the flug was zimmed does not mean that it was blummed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the flug was blummed from the given premises. The answer is 'no'.",
