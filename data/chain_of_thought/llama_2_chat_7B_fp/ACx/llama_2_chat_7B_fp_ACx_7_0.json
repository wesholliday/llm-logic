If the first statement \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\" is true, then the second statement \"The whiffle tinked\" cannot be true, because the first statement implies that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The whiffle was shanked\" from the given statements.
