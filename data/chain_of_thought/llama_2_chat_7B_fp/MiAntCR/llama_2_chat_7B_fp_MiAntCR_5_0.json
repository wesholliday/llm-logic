It could be signed for at any time, including tomorrow or next week.\n\nHowever, if the package is signed for, it is likely that it will be delivered to the recipient's address. Therefore, we can infer that \"The package might be delivered today and signed for\" is a possibility, but we cannot conclude that it will definitely happen.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
