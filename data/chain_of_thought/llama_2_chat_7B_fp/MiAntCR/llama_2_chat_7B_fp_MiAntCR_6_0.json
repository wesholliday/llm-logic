It simply means that the starting time of the concert is uncertain or unspecified.\n\nThe statement \"The concert might be sold out and start at 8 PM\" would imply that the concert is sold out, but this is not explicitly stated in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that the concert is sold out based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
