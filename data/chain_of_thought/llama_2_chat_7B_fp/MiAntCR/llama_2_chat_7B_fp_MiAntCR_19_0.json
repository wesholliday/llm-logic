However, it does not necessarily imply that the entire application must be completed online. It's possible that the application can be completed offline and then uploaded online, or that some parts of the application can be completed online while others are completed offline.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The application might be completed online and include references\" solely based on the given sentence.\n\nAnswer: No",
