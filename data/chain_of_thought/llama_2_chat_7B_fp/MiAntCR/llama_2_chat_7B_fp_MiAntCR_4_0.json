However, we can make an inference about the time of the meeting based on the context of the sentence.\n\nIf the sentence \"The meeting might be in the conference room\" is true, then it is likely that the meeting is taking place in the conference room at some point during the day. Since the sentence does not provide any information about the time of the meeting, we cannot infer the exact time of the meeting. However, we can infer that the meeting might be taking place at any time during the day, including 2 PM.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'The meeting might be at 2 PM and in the conference room'?\" is \"yes\".",
