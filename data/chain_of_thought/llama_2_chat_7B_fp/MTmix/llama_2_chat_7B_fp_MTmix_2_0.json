However, the statement \"The wug might not have bimmed the zoint\" suggests that the wug might not have done something (bimmed the zoint) that would be expected if its hair was flopped.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the wug was flooped, it did not bim the zoint. This means that the wug was not flooped.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
