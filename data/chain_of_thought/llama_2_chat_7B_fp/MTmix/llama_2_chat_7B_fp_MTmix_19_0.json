Therefore, the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The smonk was not vreebled\" from the given premises, we need to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe argument is valid, as the conclusion logically follows from the premises. If the smonk was vreebled, then it must have plagged, and if it might not have plagged, then it was not vreebled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The smonk was not vreebled\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
