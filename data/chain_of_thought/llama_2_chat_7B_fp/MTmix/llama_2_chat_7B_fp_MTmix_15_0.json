In this case, the argument is not valid.\n\nThe reason is that the second premise \"The dreb might not have been spened\" does not necessarily imply that the dreb was not vroombed. It only suggests that the dreb might not have been spened, which does not necessarily imply that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The dreb was not vroombed\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
