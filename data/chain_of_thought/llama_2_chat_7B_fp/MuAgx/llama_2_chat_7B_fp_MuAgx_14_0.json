The wumble must be zooble.\n\nFrom these statements, we cannot directly infer that \"The wumble must be gronk for a flibbit and zooble\" because the statements do not provide any logical connection between \"gronk\" and \"zooble\". While \"gronk\" is mentioned in the first statement, it is not explicitly mentioned in the second statement. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"gronk\" and \"zooble\" are related in any way.\n\nAnswer: No",
