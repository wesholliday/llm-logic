The zinger was not fraggled.\n\nWe need to use logical reasoning to determine whether we can infer that the zinger was not smoogled.\n\nThe first statement suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between being fraggled and being smoogled. If the zinger was fraggled, it means it was in a certain state, and from that state, it follows logically that it was also in another state, which is being smoogled.\n\nHowever, the second statement tells us that the zinger was not fraggled. This means that the zinger was not in the state of being fraggled, which in turn means that it was not possible for it to be smoogled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the zinger was not smoogled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
