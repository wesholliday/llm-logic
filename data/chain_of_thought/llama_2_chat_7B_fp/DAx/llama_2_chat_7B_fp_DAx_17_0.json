The argument is as follows:\n\n1. If the flob was skizzled, then the flob moved.\n2. The flob was not skizzled.\n3. Therefore, the flob was not moved.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The flob was not moved\" from the given premises, we need to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nA valid argument is one in which the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the argument is valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
