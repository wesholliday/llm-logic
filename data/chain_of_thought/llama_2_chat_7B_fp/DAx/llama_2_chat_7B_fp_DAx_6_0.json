If the first statement is true, then the second statement must be false, and vice versa. In other words, if the grommet was sploffed, then it did not plop the frink, and if the grommet was not sploffed, then it did plop the frink.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer \"The grommet did not plop the frink\" if the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
