If the fribble is not snurgled, then it is unlikely that it will crinkle.\n\nHowever, the statement \"The fribble was not snurgled\" does not directly imply that the fribble did not crinkle. It only states that the fribble was not snurgled, which does not necessarily imply that it did not crinkle.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the fribble did not crinkle based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
