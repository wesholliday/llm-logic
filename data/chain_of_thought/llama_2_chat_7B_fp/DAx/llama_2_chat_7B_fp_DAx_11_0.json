The argument is:\n\nIf the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\nThe flug was not blummed.\nTherefore, the flug was not zimmed.\n\nHowever, this argument is invalid because the second premise does not necessarily lead to the conclusion. Just because the flug was not blummed does not mean it was not zimmed. The argument is missing a crucial premise that would establish a causal relationship between being blummed and being zimmed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the flug was not zimmed based on the given premises. The argument is invalid, and we cannot make any conclusions about the flug's zimming status.\n\nAnswer: No.",
