The dreb was not vroombed.\n\nWe need to use logical reasoning to infer whether we can conclude that the dreb was not spened.\n\nTo do this, we can use the law of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nSo, if the dreb was not vroombed, then we cannot say that the dreb was spened, because the statement \"the dreb was spened\" implies that the dreb was vroombed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
