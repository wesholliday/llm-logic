In this case, the argument is not valid.\n\nThe reason is that the premise 'The smonk was not vreebled' does not necessarily imply that the smonk was not plagged. The term 'vreebled' is not defined in the argument, and it is possible that it has a different meaning than 'plagued'. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the smonk was not plagged based solely on the premises provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
