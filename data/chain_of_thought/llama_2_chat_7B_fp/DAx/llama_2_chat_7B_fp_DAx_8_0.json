The argument is:\n\nIf the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\nThe sprocket was not cranked.\nTherefore, the sprocket was not daggled.\n\nThe problem with this argument is that the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. Just because the sprocket was not cranked, it does not necessarily mean that it was not daggled. There could be other factors at play that would cause the sprocket to be daggled even if it was not cranked.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is 'no'. We cannot infer that the sprocket was not daggled just by knowing that it was not cranked.",
