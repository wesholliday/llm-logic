However, the statement \"The wug was not sproinged\" tells us that the wug was not subjected to the event of being sproinged.\n\nIf we assume that the events of being sproinged and garpled are mutually exclusive (i.e., they cannot happen at the same time), then we can conclude that if the wug was not sproinged, it was not garpled either. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
