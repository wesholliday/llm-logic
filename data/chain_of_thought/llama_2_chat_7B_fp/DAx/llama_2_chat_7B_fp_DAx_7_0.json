This means that if the whiffle was in a certain position or state (shanked), then it must be in another position or state (tinked).\n\nHowever, the second statement tells us that the whiffle was not shanked. This means that the whiffle was not in the position or state of being shanked.\n\nNow, we need to use our understanding of the statements to determine whether we can infer \"The whiffle did not tink\" from the given statements. If the whiffle was not shanked, then it did not tink. Therefore, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
