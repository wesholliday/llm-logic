However, if the splat was not morphed, then it did not undergo any transformation or change in form.\n\nNow, based on these statements, we can infer that if the splat did not undergo any transformation or change in form (i.e., it was not morphed), then it did not quank. Therefore, the answer is 'yes'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
