In this case, the premises are:\n\n1. If the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is in the forest.\n2. The unicorn is in the forest.\n\nWe want to know if we can infer that the griffin is also in the forest. To do this, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the two premises.\n\nThe logical relationship between the two premises is a conditional statement. If the first premise is true, then the second premise follows. In other words, if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is also in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the unicorn is in the forest, then the griffin is also in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
