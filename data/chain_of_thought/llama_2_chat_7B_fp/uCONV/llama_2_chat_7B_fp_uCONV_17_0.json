In other words, if Ben ate pasta, it is likely that Kate ate salad as well.\n\nTo infer that if Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta, we need to use the same logical reasoning as before. We are given that Kate ate salad, and we want to know if we can infer that Ben ate pasta.\n\nUsing the same causal relationship as before, we can conclude that if Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
