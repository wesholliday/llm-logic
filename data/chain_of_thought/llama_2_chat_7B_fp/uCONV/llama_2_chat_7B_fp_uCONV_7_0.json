In other words, if Alex finished the race, it means that Chris also finished the race.\n\nTo infer that if Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race, we need to use the transitive property of causality. This property states that if A causes B, and B causes C, then A causes C.\n\nApplying this property to the given statement, we can see that Alex finishing the race causes Chris to finish the race (since Chris finished the race if Alex finished it), and Chris finishing the race causes Alex to finish the race (since Alex finished the race if Chris finished it).\n\nTherefore, using the transitive property of causality, we can infer that if Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
