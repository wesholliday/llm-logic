Therefore, we can create a logical argument as follows:\n\nPremise 1: Sue chose pizza.\nPremise 2: Bob chose pasta.\nConclusion: If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises, as if Bob chose pasta, then Sue must have chosen the other option, which is pizza.
