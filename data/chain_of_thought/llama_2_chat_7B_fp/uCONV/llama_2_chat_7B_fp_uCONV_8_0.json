            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on the premise that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This means that if the vampire is awake, it must be true that the mummy is also awake.\n\nHowever, this argument is invalid because it is based on a false assumption. Just because the vampire is awake, it does not necessarily mean that the mummy is also awake. There could be other factors at play that would prevent the mummy from being awake, such as the mummy being in a different location or having a different schedule.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the mummy is awake, then the vampire is awake. The argument is invalid and does not logically follow.\n\nAnswer: No",
