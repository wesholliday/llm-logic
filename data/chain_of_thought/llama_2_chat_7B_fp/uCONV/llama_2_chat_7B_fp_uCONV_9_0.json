In this case, we are given two statements: \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" We are asked to infer whether we can conclude that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to evaluate the relationship between the two statements. If Mark bought the blue shirt, it means that he purchased a shirt that is not red. Since Lisa bought the red shirt, it means that she purchased a shirt that is different from the one Mark bought. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: No",
