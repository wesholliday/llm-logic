It suggests that if the condition of completing homework is met, the consequence of playing video games will occur.\n\nHowever, the additional clause \"and my computer catches on fire\" does not logically follow from the original statement. It is an unrelated and absurd event that does not affect the causal relationship between completing homework and playing video games. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the computer catches on fire, we can play video games.\n\nAnswer: No",
