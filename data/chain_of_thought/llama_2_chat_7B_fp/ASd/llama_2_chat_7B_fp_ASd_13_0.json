However, this statement does not take into account the type of food consumed during exercise. If the person exercising consumes junk food, it is unlikely that they will lose weight.\n\nThe statement \"If I exercise and eat junk food, I will lose weight\" is a logical contradiction. Exercise is intended to burn calories and promote weight loss, but consuming junk food can lead to an increase in calorie intake, which can negate the weight loss benefits of exercise. Therefore, the statement is false.\n\nAnswer: No",
