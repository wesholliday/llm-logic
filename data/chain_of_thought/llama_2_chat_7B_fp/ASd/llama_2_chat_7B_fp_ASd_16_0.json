However, this statement does not provide any information about the impact of fertilizing the lawn during a drought.\n\nTo make an inference about the effect of fertilizing the lawn during a drought, we would need additional information about the relationship between fertilizing and drought conditions. For example, if we know that fertilizing the lawn during a drought can help it survive and recover more quickly, then we could infer that if we fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green.\n\nHowever, without additional information, it is not possible to make an inference about the effect of fertilizing the lawn during a drought. Therefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer...?\" is \"no.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
