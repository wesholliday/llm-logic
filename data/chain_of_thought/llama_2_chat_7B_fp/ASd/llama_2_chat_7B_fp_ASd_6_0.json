If the speaker is wearing earplugs, it means that they are actively trying to block or reduce the amount of sound that reaches their ears. Therefore, if you scream while the speaker is wearing earplugs, it will not hurt their ears, as the earplugs will be effective in blocking out the sound.\n\nAnswer: No",
