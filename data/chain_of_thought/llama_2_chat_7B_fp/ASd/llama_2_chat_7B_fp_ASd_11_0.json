However, this argument is based on a false premise. Getting enough sleep and doing hard labor are two different things, and just because getting enough sleep doesn't guarantee that you won't be tired, it doesn't mean that doing hard labor won't make you tired either.\n\nDoing hard labor can be physically demanding and can cause fatigue, regardless of how much sleep you get. Additionally, the amount of sleep you need can vary from person to person, and some people may need more sleep than others to feel rested and alert.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired. The two are not directly related, and it's possible to be tired even if you get enough sleep.\n\nAnswer: No",
