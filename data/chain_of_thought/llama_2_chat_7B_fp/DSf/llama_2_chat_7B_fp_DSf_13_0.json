We are given two premises: \"Either the toy is sitting on the shelf or it is in the toy box\" and \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf.\" From these premises, we can deduce the conclusion \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nTo see why, let's break down the argument:\n\n1. Either the toy is sitting on the shelf or it is in the toy box. (Premise)\n2. The toy isn't sitting on the shelf. (Premise)\n3. Therefore, the toy must be in the toy box. (Deductive conclusion)\n\nNow, are we ready to answer the question?\n\nAnswer: Yes",
