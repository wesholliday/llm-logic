We need to use logical reasoning to determine whether we can infer \"The pen is in my bag\" from these statements.\n\nTo do this, we can use the logical rule of exclusion. If the pen is not on the desk, then it must be in the bag. Therefore, if the pen isn't on the desk, we can infer that it is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
