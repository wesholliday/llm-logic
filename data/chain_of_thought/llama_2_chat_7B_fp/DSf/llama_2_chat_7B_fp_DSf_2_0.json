In this case, the two possibilities are that the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf, and the false statement is that the book isn't resting on the table.\n\nTo use this information to infer the location of the book, we can apply the principle of non-contradiction, which states that something cannot be both true and false at the same time. Since we know that the book isn't resting on the table, we can conclude that it must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
