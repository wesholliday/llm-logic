The contrapositive of \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" is \"If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nNow, we are given that the wolf was not in the den. So, using the contrapositive, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
