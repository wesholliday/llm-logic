However, if Chris did not finish the race, then it means that Chris did not complete the race. Since Chris did not finish the race, it does not necessarily mean that Alex did not finish the race as well.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Alex did not finish the race based on the information given in the question. The answer is 'no'.",
