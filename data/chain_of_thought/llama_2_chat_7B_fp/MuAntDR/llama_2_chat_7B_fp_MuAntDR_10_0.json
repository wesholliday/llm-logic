The word \"or\" in the statement indicates that both options are possible, and it does not imply a stronger connection between the two.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the document must have been notarized based solely on the given statement. It is possible that the document was signed but not notarized, or that it was not signed at all.\n\nAnswer: No",
