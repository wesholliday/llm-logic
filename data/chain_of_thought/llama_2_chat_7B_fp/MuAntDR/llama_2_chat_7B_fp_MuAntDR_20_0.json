            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"The event must have been formal or semi-formal\" implies that the event in question had a certain level of formality, either being formal or semi-formal.\n\nA formal event is typically characterized by a more structured and traditional atmosphere, with a focus on etiquette and proper behavior. On the other hand, a semi-formal event is less formal and may have a more relaxed atmosphere, with a mix of formal and informal elements.\n\nGiven the information provided, we can infer that the event was likely semi-formal rather than formal, as the statement only provides two options for the level of formality. Therefore, the answer is 'yes'.",
