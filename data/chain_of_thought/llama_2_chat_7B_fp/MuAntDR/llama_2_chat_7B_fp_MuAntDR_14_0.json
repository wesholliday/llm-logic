It does not explicitly state that the contract must be renewable, but rather provides two options: it could be valid for a year or it could be renewable.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the contract must have been renewable. It is possible that the contract is valid for a year and does not have the option to be renewed.\n\nAnswer: No",
