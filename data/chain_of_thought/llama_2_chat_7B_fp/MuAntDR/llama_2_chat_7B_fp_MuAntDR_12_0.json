The condition is \"the project must have been completed by Friday\" and the consequence is \"the project must have been extended.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The project must have been extended\" from the given statement, we need to evaluate the condition and see if it is true or false.\n\nIf the project was not completed by Friday, then the consequence \"the project must have been extended\" is true, because the project was not completed on time and therefore had to be extended.\n\nOn the other hand, if the project was completed by Friday, then the consequence \"the project must have been extended\" is false, because the project was completed on time and therefore did not need to be extended.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we can infer \"The project must have been extended\" if the project was not completed by Friday.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
