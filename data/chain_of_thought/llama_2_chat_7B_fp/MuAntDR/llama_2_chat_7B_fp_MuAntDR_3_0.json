The premises are:\n\n* The keys must have been in the drawer or on the table.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that the keys were on the table because the statement explicitly states that the keys must have been in either the drawer or on the table, which means that they cannot be in the drawer. Therefore, the only possible location for the keys is on the table.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
