The statement suggests that the restaurant was either closed on Monday or open for limited hours. Since the statement does not provide any information about the restaurant's usual hours of operation, we cannot directly infer that it was open for limited hours.\n\nHowever, we can consider the possibility that the restaurant was open for limited hours on Monday. If the restaurant was open on Monday, but for limited hours, then it would mean that the restaurant was not open for its usual hours. Therefore, we can infer that the restaurant was open for limited hours on Monday.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
