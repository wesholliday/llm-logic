However, this is not necessarily true. The statement does not provide any evidence or reasoning to support the idea that the plonk must be on both wibble and shimble.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The plonk must be on wibble or it must be on shimble\" from the given statement. The correct answer is \"No.\"",
