The words \"wibble,\" \"wumble,\" \"shimble,\" and \"blurble\" are not related to each other in any meaningful way, and the sentence does not provide any context or clues that would allow us to infer the meaning of the sentence.\n\nTherefore, we cannot answer the question \"Can we infer 'The wibble might be blurble wobble'?\" with a definitive \"yes\" or \"no.\" The sentence is simply nonsensical, and we cannot make any inferences from it.\n\nAnswer: No",
