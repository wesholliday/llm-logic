            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The doll was not plastic\" from the given premises, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nIf the first premise \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\" is true, then we can conclude that the truck was not metal.\n\nIf the second premise \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" is true, then we can conclude that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n\nNow, if we combine these two premises, we can draw the following conclusion:\n\nIf the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. (From the second premise)\nBut we know that the truck was not metal (from the first premise).\nTherefore, we can conclude that the doll was not plastic. (From the negation of the second premise)\n\nAnswer: Yes",
