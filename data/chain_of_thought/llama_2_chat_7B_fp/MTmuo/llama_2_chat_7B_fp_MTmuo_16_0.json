The shirt was cotton and the pants were denim. (This is the only combination that contradicts both premises, so it is the only possible conclusion we can draw.)\n2. The shirt was not cotton and the pants were not denim. (This combination does not contradict either premise, so it is not a possible conclusion.)\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer \"The shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
