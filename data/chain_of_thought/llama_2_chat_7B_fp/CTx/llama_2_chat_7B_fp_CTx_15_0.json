In this case, the premise is \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\". To infer the conclusion, we need to apply the logical operator 'then' to the premise, which means that if the first statement is true, the second statement must also be true.\n\nTherefore, if the dreb was vroombed, it must have been spened. So, the conclusion is 'yes'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
