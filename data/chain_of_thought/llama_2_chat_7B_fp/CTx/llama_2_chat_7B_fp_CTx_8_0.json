In other words, if the sprocket is cranked, it must be daggled, and vice versa.\n\nHowever, the statement \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\" does not necessarily follow from the previous statement. While it is possible that if the sprocket is not daggled, it is not cranked, there could be other factors at play that would prevent the sprocket from being cranked, even if it is not daggled.\n\nFor example, the sprocket could be stuck or damaged, preventing it from being cranked even if it is not daggled. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the sprocket is not daggled, it is not cranked, without additional information or context.\n\nAnswer: No",
