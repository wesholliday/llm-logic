It means that if the flugel was blimmed, then it must have been zargled.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer the opposite statement: \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nTo answer this question, we need to use the law of non-contradiction, which states that a thing cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nIf the flugel was not zargled, then it cannot be blimmed, because blimming implies zargling. Therefore, we can infer that if the flugel was not zargled, then it was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
