In this case, the premise is \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked\" from the given statement, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe statement \"If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked\" is a logical consequence of the premise \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\" This means that if the twonk was not varnished, then it was not plinked, because the premise states that varnishing occurs after plinking.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
