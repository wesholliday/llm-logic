If the glip was slogged, it means that it was subjected to a certain treatment or process, and as a result, it became tragged. Therefore, if the glip was not tragged, it means that it was not subjected to the necessary treatment or process to become tragged, and therefore it was not slogged.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
