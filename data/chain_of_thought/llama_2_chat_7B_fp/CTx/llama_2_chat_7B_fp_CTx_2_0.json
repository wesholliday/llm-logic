In other words, if the wug is flooped, it will necessarily bim the zoint.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped\" implies a negation of the previous statement, meaning that if the wug did not bim the zoint, it does not necessarily mean that it was not flooped.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
