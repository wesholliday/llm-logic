In other words, if the whiffle is shanked, it will necessarily tink.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\" implies that there is an inverse relationship between the whiffle not tinking and the whiffle not being shanked. In other words, if the whiffle does not tink, it does not necessarily mean that it was not shanked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\" based solely on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
