In other words, if the clug was fleeked, then it must have snugged.\n\nNow, let's try to infer the opposite statement: \"If the clug did not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked.\"\n\nTo do this, we need to use the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\" is \"If the clug did not snug, then the clug was not fleeked.\"\n\nSo, if the clug did not snug, we can infer that it was not fleeked. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
