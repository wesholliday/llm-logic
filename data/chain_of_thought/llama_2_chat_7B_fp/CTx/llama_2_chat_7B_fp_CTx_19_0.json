In other words, if the smonk is vreebled, it is likely that the smonk will also plag.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"If the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\" implies that there is a direct relationship between the smonk not plagging and the smonk not being vreebled. In other words, if the smonk did not plag, it is likely that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can infer that if the smonk did not plag, then the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
