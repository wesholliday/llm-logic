The statement is in the form of a conditional, where if the first part of the sentence is true, then the second part must also be true.\n\nThe first part of the sentence is \"If the splat was morphed,\" which means that the splat has undergone some transformation or change. The second part of the sentence is \"then the splat quanked.\" Quanking is not a defined term in the context of the sentence, so we cannot infer anything about it.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that if the splat did not quank, then it was not morphed. The statement is invalid because the second part of the sentence is not logically connected to the first part.\n\nAnswer: No",
