The premises are:\n\n1. Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged.\n2. The smonk might not be plagged.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer two possible conclusions:\n\n1. If the smonk is not plagged, then it must be vreebled.\n2. If the smonk is not vreebled, then it must be plagged.\n\nNow, to answer your question, we need to determine which of the two conclusions is more likely based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
