The dreb might not be spened.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the dreb is vroombed. Here's how:\n\n1. Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened. This means that the dreb is either vroombed or spened.\n2. The dreb might not be spened. This means that the dreb is not spened.\n3. If the dreb is not spened, then it must be vroombed. This is the conclusion we draw from the first statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
