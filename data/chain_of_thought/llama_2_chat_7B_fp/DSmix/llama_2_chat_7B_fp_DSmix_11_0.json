If it is blummed, then it cannot also be zimmed, as blumming and zimming are mutually exclusive. On the other hand, if it is not blummed, then it might be zimmed.\n\nNow, considering the second statement \"The flug might not be zimmed,\" we can see that if the flug is blummed, then it cannot be zimmed. Therefore, if the flug might not be zimmed, then it must be blummed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
