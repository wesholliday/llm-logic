This is because if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed, according to the first statement.\n\nHowever, if we assume that \"The splat might not be quanked\" means that the splat is quanked, then we cannot infer that the splat is morphed. This is because the first statement only states that either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked, but does not specify that the splat must be morphed if it is quanked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer \"The splat is morphed\" with certainty. The answer is 'no'.",
