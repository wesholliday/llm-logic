The flugel might not be zargled.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce the following:\n\nIf the flugel is not zargled, then it must be blimmed.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement: \"The flugel might not be zargled.\" This statement implies that the flugel might not have the property of being zargled.\n\nSince the flugel might not be zargled, we can conclude that it must be blimmed. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
