The premises are:\n\n1. Either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked.\n2. The whiffle might not be tinked.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer one of the two conclusions:\n\n1. If the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be shanked.\n2. If the whiffle is not tinked, then it is shanked.\n\nNow, based on the second premise, we can infer that the whiffle is not tinked. This means that the only possible conclusion is that the whiffle is shanked. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
