However, it does not explicitly state that the flump is shimbled.\n\nTo infer that the flump might be shimbled, we would need additional information or context that suggests the flump is in a state of being shimbled. For example, if the sentence \"The flump was shimbled\" or \"The flump had been shimbled\" is present in the same text or context, then we could infer that the flump is shimbled.\n\nAnswer: No",
