If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\n\nWe can use logical reasoning to deduce a conclusion based on these statements.\n\nIf the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened (by definition of \"vroombed\").\n\nIf the dreb was not spened, then it was not vroombed (by definition of \"spened\").\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
