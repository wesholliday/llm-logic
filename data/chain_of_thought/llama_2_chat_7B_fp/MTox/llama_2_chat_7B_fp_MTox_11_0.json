This means that if the flug was not blummed, then it was not zimmed.\n\nNow, let's consider the first statement: \"The flug was not zimmed.\" This statement tells us that the flug was not zimmed. Since we know that if the flug was blummed, then it was zimmed, and the flug was not blummed, we can conclude that the flug was not zimmed.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'The flug was not blummed'?\" is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
