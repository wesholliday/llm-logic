The argument states that if the flob was skizzled, then the flob moved. However, simply because the flob did not move does not mean that it was not skizzled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the flob was not skizzled based solely on the fact that it did not move. The argument is invalid and does not logically follow.\n\nAnswer: No",
