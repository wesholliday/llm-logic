If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\n\nWe need to use logical reasoning to infer whether we can conclude that the shank was not plooked based on the given statements.\n\nIf we assume that the shank was plooked, then we can conclude that the shank was nugged. This is because the second statement states that if the shank was plooked, then it was nugged.\n\nHowever, if the shank was not nugged, then it means that it was not plooked. This is because the first statement states that the shank was not nugged.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the shank was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
