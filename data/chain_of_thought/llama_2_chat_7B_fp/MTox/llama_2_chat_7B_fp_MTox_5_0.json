If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\n\nTo infer whether 'The zinger was not fraggled' from these statements, we can use the logical rule of inference known as modus tollens. This rule states that if a conclusion follows from two premises, and one of the premises is false, then the conclusion is also false.\n\nSo, if we assume that the premises are true, we can use modus tollens to deduce the conclusion:\n\n1. The zinger was not smoogled (premise)\n2. If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled (premise)\n3. Therefore, the zinger was not fraggled (conclusion)\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
