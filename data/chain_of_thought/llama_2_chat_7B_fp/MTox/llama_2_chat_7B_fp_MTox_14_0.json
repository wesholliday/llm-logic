If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\n\nWe need to use logical reasoning to infer whether we can conclude that the clug was not fleeked based on these statements.\n\nFrom statement 2, we can see that if the clug was fleeked, then it snugged. This means that if the clug did not snug, then it was not fleeked.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 1: \"The clug did not snugged.\" This statement tells us that the clug did not perform the action of snugging.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, we can conclude that if the clug did not snug, then it was not fleeked. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
