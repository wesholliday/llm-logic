This means that we are considering both options equally likely and that either one of them could be true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the two options:\n\n1. The book must have been on the shelf: This option implies that the book was physically present on a shelf in the room.\n2. The book must have been in the backpack: This option implies that the book was inside a backpack that belonged to someone in the room.\n\nSince both options are equally likely, we can infer that the book must have been on the shelf or in the backpack. Therefore, the answer is 'yes'.",
