In this case, the two options are \"delivered by truck\" and \"delivered by plane\".\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer \"The package must have been delivered by truck or it must have been delivered by plane\" because the statement is already in disjunctive form. The two options are already separate and distinct, and there is no need to combine them into a single statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
