In this case, the sentence is suggesting that the building must have had either an elevator or wheelchair ramps, but not both.\n\nTo infer whether the building must have had an elevator or wheelchair ramps, we need to consider the context of the sentence and the information provided. Since the sentence does not explicitly state that the building had both an elevator and wheelchair ramps, we can infer that the building must have had either one or the other, but not both.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
