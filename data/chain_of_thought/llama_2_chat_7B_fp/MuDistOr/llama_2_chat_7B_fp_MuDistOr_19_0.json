The use of \"or\" in the sentence indicates that both options are mutually exclusive and that the candidate cannot have had both a degree and relevant work experience.\n\nTherefore, based on the sentence provided, we cannot infer that the candidate must have had a degree or they must have had relevant work experience. Instead, we can infer that the candidate must have had one of the two options, but not both.\n\nAnswer: No",
