In this case, the argument states that either the pen is in the speaker's bag or it must be on their desk. However, it is not explicitly stated that the pen must be on the desk.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the pen is in the speaker's bag, we need to analyze the argument's premises and conclusion. If the pen is in the speaker's bag, then it is not on the desk, and vice versa. Therefore, if the pen is not on the desk, we can infer that it is in the speaker's bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
