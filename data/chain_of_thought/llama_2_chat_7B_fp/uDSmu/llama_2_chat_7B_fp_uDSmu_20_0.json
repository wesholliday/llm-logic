However, it is not explicitly stated that the sunglasses must be perched on her head. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the sunglasses are in her bag with absolute certainty.\n\nHowever, we can use logic to make an educated guess. If the sunglasses are not perched on her head, then they must be in her bag. Therefore, the answer is 'yes', the sunglasses are likely in her bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
