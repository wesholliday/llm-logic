However, the argument does not provide any information that would allow us to infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nThe argument states that it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table, which means that the book could still be resting on the shelf. Therefore, we cannot infer that the book is on the shelf based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
