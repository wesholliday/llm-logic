However, the argument does not provide any information that rules out the possibility that the notebook might be in neither of these locations.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the notebook is definitely in the drawer. The argument only provides two exclusive possibilities, but does not eliminate the possibility that the notebook might be in neither of those locations.\n\nAnswer: No",
