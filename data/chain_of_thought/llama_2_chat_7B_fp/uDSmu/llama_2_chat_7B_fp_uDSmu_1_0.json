In this case, the argument states that either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden. However, it also states that it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that Fido is inside, we need to analyze the two possibilities presented in the argument. If Fido is inside, then it is not in the garden. If Fido must be in the garden, then it is not inside.\n\nSince the argument states that it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden, we can conclude that Fido is inside. Therefore, the answer is 'yes'.",
