In order to infer the opposite conclusion (If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was sploffed), we need to reverse the condition and conclusion.\n\nSo, if the grommet plopped the frink, it means that the grommet was not sploffed. Therefore, the answer to the question is 'no'.\n\nAnswer: no",
