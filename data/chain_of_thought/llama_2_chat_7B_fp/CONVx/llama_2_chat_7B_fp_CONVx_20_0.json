The premise is \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\" We need to determine whether we can infer the conclusion \"If the fleeg surned, then it was bluttered\" from the given premise.\n\nTo do this, we need to analyze the meaning of the words \"bluttered\" and \"surned\" in the context of the statement. \"Bluttered\" means to make a loud, high-pitched noise, while \"surned\" means to turn or rotate rapidly.\n\nBased on the given premise, we can infer that if the fleeg made a loud, high-pitched noise, then it rotated rapidly. Therefore, the conclusion \"If the fleeg surned, then it was bluttered\" can be inferred from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
