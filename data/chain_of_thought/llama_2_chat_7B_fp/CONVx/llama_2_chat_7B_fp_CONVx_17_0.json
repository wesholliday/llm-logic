In other words, if the flob was skizzled, then it must have moved.\n\nTo see why, let's break down the statement \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\":\n\n* \"If the flob was skizzled\" means that the flob was in a certain state (i.e., skizzled).\n* \"then the flob movated\" means that the flob moved.\n\nGiven that the flob moved, we can infer that it was in the state of being skizzled. In other words, if the flob movated, then it must have been skizzled first.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
