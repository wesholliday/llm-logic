            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument provided is in the form of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a type of argument that uses a \"or\" statement to connect the premises. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\nPremise 2: It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\nConclusion: The vampire was not awake.\n\nTo determine the validity of this argument, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Check if the premises are true.\n2. Check if the argument form is valid.\n3. Evaluate the conclusion based on the premises.\n\nLet's evaluate each step:\n\n1. Check if the premises are true:\n\nPremise 1: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\nThis premise is true.\n\nPremise 2: It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\nThis premise is also true.\n\n2. Check if the argument form is valid:\n\nA disjunctive syllogism is a valid argument form, as long as the premises are true and the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n3. Evaluate the conclusion based on the premises:\n\nSince the premises are true, the conclusion logically follows:\n\nConclusion: The vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
