            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument presented is not logically valid. The first premise states that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. However, the second premise states that it is not the case that the banana must be yellow. This means that the conclusion, \"The apple was not red,\" cannot be logically deduced from the premises.\n\nIn other words, just because the banana is not yellow, it does not necessarily follow that the apple was not red. There could be other reasons why the apple is not red, such as the apple being green or orange. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid and cannot be used to draw a conclusion about the color of the apple.\n\nAnswer: No",
