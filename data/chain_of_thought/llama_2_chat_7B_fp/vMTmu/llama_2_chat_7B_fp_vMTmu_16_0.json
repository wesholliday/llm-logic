            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument presented is in the form of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a type of argument that uses \"either-or\" statements to reach a conclusion. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. (Premise)\n2. It's not the case that the pants must have been denim. (Premise)\n3. Therefore, the shirt was not cotton. (Conclusion)\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate the truth of the premises and the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nThe first premise is true, as it is a definition or a fact that if the shirt is made of cotton, then the pants must be made of denim. However, the second premise is false, as there is no logical connection between the fact that the pants are not made of denim and the shirt being or not being cotton. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, and the argument is not valid.",
