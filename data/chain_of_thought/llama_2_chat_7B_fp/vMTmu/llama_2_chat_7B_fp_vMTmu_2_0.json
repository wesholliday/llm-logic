            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument provided is in the form of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a type of argument that uses the logical operators \"or\" and \"not\" to arrive at a conclusion. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\nPremise 2: It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\nConclusion: The griffin was not in the forest.\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate the argument's form and structure. A logically valid argument is one in which the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nIn this case, the argument is valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises. If the griffin was in the forest, then by the first premise, the unicorn must have been in the forest. However, the second premise states that it's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest, which means that the griffin was not in the forest. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
