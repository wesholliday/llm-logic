            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument provided is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as \"modus tollens.\" Modus tollens is a type of argument that is used to deny the truth of a proposition based on the premise that if a certain condition is true, then another condition must also be true. However, this does not necessarily follow, as the two conditions may not be related or may have different truth values.\n\nIn this case, the argument is as follows:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\n2. Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n3. Therefore, Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nHowever, this argument is flawed because the second premise (Sue might not have been at the wedding) does not necessarily imply that Mary was not at the wedding. It is possible that Sue was not at the wedding for reasons unrelated to Mary's attendance. Therefore, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding based solely on the given argument.\n\nAnswer: No.",
