In this case, the premises are:\n\n1. The book was written by James.\n2. The book is not a mystery novel.\n\nFrom these premises, we can conclude that the book was not written by James, because if the book was written by James, it would be a mystery novel, and since it is not a mystery novel, it was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
