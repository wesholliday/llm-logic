Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\n\nFrom the given statements, we can infer the following:\n\n* Lisa bought the red shirt, which means she purchased one of the two available shirts (red or blue).\n* Mark must have bought the blue shirt, which means he purchased the other available shirt (blue).\n* Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, which means he did not purchase the blue shirt.\n\nNow, based on the above inferences, we can answer the question:\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nExplanation: Since Lisa bought the red shirt, we know that she did purchase one of the two available shirts. Since Mark must have bought the blue shirt, we know that he did purchase one of the two available shirts. However, Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, which means he could have purchased the red shirt instead. Therefore, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.",
