Just because Bob chose pasta, it does not mean that Sue did not choose pizza. There could be other factors at play, such as Bob and Sue having different preferences or Bob simply making an incorrect assumption.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sue did not choose pizza based solely on the fact that Bob chose pasta. We need more information or evidence to make such an inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
