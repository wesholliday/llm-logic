Chris might not have finished the race.\n\nFrom these statements, we cannot infer that Alex did not finish the race. Here's why:\n\nJust because Chris might not have finished the race, it doesn't mean that Alex didn't finish the race as well. Chris's lack of finish does not necessarily imply that Alex also did not finish.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Alex did not finish the race based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
