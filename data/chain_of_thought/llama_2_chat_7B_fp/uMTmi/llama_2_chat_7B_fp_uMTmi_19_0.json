The conclusion \"Tom did not watch football\" is drawn based on the assumption that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. However, this assumption is false, as there is no logical connection between Tom's watching football and Jen's watching basketball.\n\nJen might not have watched basketball, regardless of whether Tom watched football or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that Tom did not watch football based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
