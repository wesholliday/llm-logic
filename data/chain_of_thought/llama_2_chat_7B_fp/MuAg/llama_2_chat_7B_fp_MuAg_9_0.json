In this case, we can infer that the flight was both delayed and rerouted based on the information provided.\n\nTo do this, we use the logical operators \"and\" (conjunction) and \"must.\" The conjunction \"and\" indicates that both premises must be true in order for the conclusion to be valid. The modal \"must\" indicates that the conclusion is necessary or obligatory based on the premises.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can conclude that the flight was both delayed and rerouted.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
