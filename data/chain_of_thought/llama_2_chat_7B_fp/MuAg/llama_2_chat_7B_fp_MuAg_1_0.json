The envelope must be upstairs.\n2. The envelope must be under a bed.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that the envelope is located in the upstairs area and is also located under a bed. However, we cannot infer that the envelope is specifically located in a particular bed or under a specific bed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
