The argument is valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and it is invalid if the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the argument is valid because the second premise \"Sue chose pizza\" directly implies that Bob chose pasta, given the first premise \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\". Therefore, the conclusion \"Bob chose pasta\" logically follows from the premises, and the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
