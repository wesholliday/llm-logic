            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument presented is in the form of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion. The argument consists of three parts: the first premise, the second premise, and the conclusion.\n\nThe first premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. This premise is making a direct connection between the color of the apple and the color of the banana.\n\nThe second premise states that the apple was red. This premise provides evidence that the condition stated in the first premise is true.\n\nThe conclusion states that the banana was yellow. Based on the first premise and the second premise, the conclusion logically follows.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion does logically follow from the premises, as the first premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow, and the second premise states that the apple was red. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
