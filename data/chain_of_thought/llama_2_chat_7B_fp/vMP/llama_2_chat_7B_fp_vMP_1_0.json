            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument presented is in the form of a syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that uses deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion. The argument consists of three parts: the first premise, the second premise, and the conclusion.\n\nThe first premise is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This premise is stating that if Mary was present at the wedding, then it is necessarily true that Sue was also present at the wedding.\n\nThe second premise is \"Mary was at the wedding.\" This premise is stating that Mary did in fact attend the wedding.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" Based on the first premise and the second premise, it logically follows that Sue was also present at the wedding.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, since Mary was present at the wedding, and if Mary was present, then Sue was present, it is logically valid to conclude that Sue was also present at the wedding. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
