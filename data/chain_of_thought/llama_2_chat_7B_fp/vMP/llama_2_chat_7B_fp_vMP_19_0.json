Tom watched football.\n\nThe conclusion that follows from these premises is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No.\n\nThe argument is not logically valid because the second premise does not necessarily guarantee that Jen watched basketball. It only states that Tom watched football, which does not provide any information about Jen's actions. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.",
