The argument is valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and it is invalid if the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion \"Chris finished the race\" is logically implied by the premises \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" and \"Alex finished the race\". Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
