The words used in the sentence are:\n\n* Bimboozle: a made-up word that sounds like \"bamboozle\" but with a different spelling\n* Zizz: a made-up word that sounds like \"sizzle\" but with a different spelling\n* Quank: a made-up word that sounds like \"stank\" but with a different spelling\n* Snork: a made-up word that sounds like \"snore\" but with a different spelling\n\nBased on the way the words are used in the sentence, it is clear that the author is using them in a humorous or playful way, rather than intending to convey any actual meaning. Therefore, it is not possible to infer any meaningful statement from the sentence.\n\nAnswer: No",
