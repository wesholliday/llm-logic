This rule states that if A implies B, and B is true, then A must also be true.\n\nApplying this rule to our situation, we can see that if the book was written by James (A), and the book is a mystery novel (B), then we can infer that James wrote the book (A \u2192 B).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can conclude that \"The book was written by James\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
