            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion \"Tom watched football\" follows from the premises \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" and \"Jen watched basketball\", we need to use logical reasoning.\n\nIf the first premise is true, then by modus ponens, the second premise must also be true. Therefore, we can conclude that Jen watched basketball.\n\nNow, if the first premise is true and the second premise is true, then by modus tollens, the negation of the conclusion \"Tom watched football\" can be deduced. In other words, if Jen watched basketball, then it is possible that Tom did not watch football.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Does it follow that 'Tom watched football' is true?\" is \"no\".\n\nAnswer: no",
