Now, if we know that \"The pants were denim\" is true, it means that the pants are indeed made of denim.\n\nUsing the logical implication rule, we can conclude that if the shirt is made of cotton, then the pants must be made of denim. Therefore, if the pants are made of denim, it follows that the shirt must be made of cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
