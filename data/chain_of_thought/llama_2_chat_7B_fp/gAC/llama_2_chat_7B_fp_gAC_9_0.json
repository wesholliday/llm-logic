            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nIn this situation, we have two statements: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" and \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" We need to determine whether the conclusion \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" follows logically from these two statements.\n\nTo do this, we can use the logical connector \"If... then...\" to create a conditional statement:\n\nIf Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nIf Mark bought the blue shirt, then... (what?)\n\nSince \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true, we can conclude that the second statement in the conditional is also true. Therefore, we can use the first statement to deduce the truth of the conclusion:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
