            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nIn this argument, we are given two premises: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Sue was at the wedding.\" From these premises, we can deduce the conclusion \"Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nTo see why, let's analyze the argument:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (premise)\n2. Sue was at the wedding (premise)\n3. Therefore, Mary was at the wedding (conclusion)\n\nThe argument follows the form of a logical deduction, where the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true because if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding, and Sue was indeed at the wedding. Therefore, the argument is valid and the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
