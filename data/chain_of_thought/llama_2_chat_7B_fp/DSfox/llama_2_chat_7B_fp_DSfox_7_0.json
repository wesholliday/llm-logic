This law states that for any proposition P, either P is true or its negation \u00acP is true.\n\nUsing this law, we can deduce that if the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be shanked. This is because if the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be either tinked or shanked, and since it is not tinked, it must be shanked.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'The whiffle is shanked' from the premises 'The whiffle is not tinked' and 'Either the whiffle is tinked or it is shanked'?\" is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
