The sprocket is not daggled and is not cranked.\n2. The sprocket is daggled and is not cranked.\n3. The sprocket is not daggled and is cranked.\n\nFrom the first premise, we can eliminate option 1, as the sprocket is not daggled. From the second premise, we can eliminate option 2, as the sprocket is not cranked. Therefore, the only remaining option is option 3, \"The sprocket is not daggled and is cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
