Either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the flugel is either zargled or blimmed, but not both.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. \"The flugel is not zargled\" means that the flugel is not in the state of being zargled.\n2. \"Either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed\" means that the flugel is in one of the two states of being zargled or blimmed.\n\nFrom these statements, we can conclude that if the flugel is not zargled, then it must be blimmed. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
