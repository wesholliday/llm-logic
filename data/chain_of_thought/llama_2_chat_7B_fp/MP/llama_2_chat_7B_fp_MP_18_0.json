If the doll is plastic, it means that the truck must be metal.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"The doll was plastic.\" This statement provides us with new information that the doll is indeed plastic.\n\nBased on the given statements, we can logically conclude that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must also be metal.
