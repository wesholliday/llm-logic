In other words, if the apple is red, it implies that the banana is yellow.\n\nThe second statement, \"The apple was red,\" provides additional information that the apple is indeed red.\n\nNow, we need to ask ourselves: Can we logically deduce that the banana is yellow based on the given premises?\n\nAnswer: Yes",
