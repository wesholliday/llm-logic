Specifically, we are using the principle of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n2. Joe went to the park.\n\nFrom these premises, we can deduce that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.
