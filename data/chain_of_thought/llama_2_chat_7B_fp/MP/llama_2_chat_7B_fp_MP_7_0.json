This law states that a statement and its negation cannot both be true.\n\nIn this case, we have two statements: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" and \"Alex finished the race.\" If we assume that both statements are true, we can deduce that Chris finished the race.\n\nTherefore, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
