            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that Sue was at the wedding based on the given premises, we need to apply the rule of inference known as modus ponens. Modus ponens is a basic rule of logic that allows us to draw a conclusion from two premises, if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nIn this case, the premises are \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Mary was at the wedding.\" Using modus ponens, we can conclude that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding, and since Mary was at the wedding, we can infer that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
