Modus ponens is a basic rule of reasoning that allows us to draw a conclusion from two premises, where the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nIn this case, the premises are \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" and \"Sue chose pizza\". Using modus ponens, we can conclude that Bob chose pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
