This rule allows us to draw a conclusion from two premises if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nIn this case, we have two premises: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" and \"The griffin was in the forest.\" Using modus ponens, we can infer the conclusion \"The unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
