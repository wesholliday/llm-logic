This is a valid logical inference because the two premises are connected by a logical connector (i.e., \"then\").\n\nNow, let's consider the additional premise \"The alien visited Mars.\" If we assume that this premise is true, then we can use the inference rule to conclude that the robot visited Jupiter. Therefore, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
