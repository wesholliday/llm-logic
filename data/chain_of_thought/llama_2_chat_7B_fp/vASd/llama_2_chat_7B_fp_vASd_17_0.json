The premise \"If I change the oil, the car will run smoothly\" does not necessarily lead to the conclusion \"If I change the oil and the transmission is shot, the car will run smoothly.\"\n\nThe reason for this is that the premise only establishes a correlation between changing the oil and the car running smoothly, but it does not guarantee that changing the oil will fix any underlying problems with the transmission. In fact, it is possible that even if the oil is changed, the transmission could still be shot and the car could not run smoothly.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: No",
