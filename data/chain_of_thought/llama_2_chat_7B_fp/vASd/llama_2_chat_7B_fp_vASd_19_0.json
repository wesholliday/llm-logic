The premise \"If you fill up the gas tank, the car will run\" is true only if the gas tank is in good condition and has enough fuel to run the car. However, the conclusion \"If you fill up the gas tank and there is a hole in it, the car will run\" is false because even if the gas tank is filled with fuel, if there is a hole in it, the fuel will leak out and the car will not run.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: No",
