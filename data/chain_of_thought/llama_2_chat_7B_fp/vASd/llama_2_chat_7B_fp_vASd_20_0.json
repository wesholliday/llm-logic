The premise \"If I take medication, I will feel better\" is a general statement that may or may not be true, depending on various factors such as the type of medication, the dosage, and the individual's health condition. However, the conclusion \"If I take medication that expired, I will feel better\" is not necessarily true, as the effectiveness of medication can decrease over time, regardless of its expiration date.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid, as the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: No",
