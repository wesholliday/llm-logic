The premise \"If we go to the concert, then we'll have a good time\" is a true statement, but it does not necessarily lead to the conclusion \"If we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time.\" The conclusion is based on an absurd and unlikely scenario, which makes the argument invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
