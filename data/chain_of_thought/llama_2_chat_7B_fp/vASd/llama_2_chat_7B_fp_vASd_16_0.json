The premise \"If I fertilize the lawn, it will be lush and green\" is not necessarily true, as there are other factors that can affect the health and appearance of the lawn, such as weather conditions, soil quality, and pest infestations.\n\nMoreover, the conclusion \"If I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green\" is also not necessarily true, as fertilizing the lawn during a drought can actually harm the grass and make it more susceptible to disease.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid, as the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: No",
