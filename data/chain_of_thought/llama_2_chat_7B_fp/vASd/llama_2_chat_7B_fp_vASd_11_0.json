The premise and conclusion do not logically follow one another.\n\nThe premise states that if you get enough sleep, you won't be tired. This is a general statement that may or may not be true, depending on various factors such as the quality of sleep, individual differences, and other circumstances.\n\nThe conclusion, on the other hand, states that if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired. This conclusion is not necessarily true, as getting enough sleep and doing hard labor are two different things that may or may not have a direct impact on fatigue levels.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid, as the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: No",
