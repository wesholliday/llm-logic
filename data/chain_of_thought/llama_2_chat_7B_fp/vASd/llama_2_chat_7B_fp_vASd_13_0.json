The premise \"If I exercise, I will lose weight\" is a causal statement that implies that exercise will lead to weight loss. However, the conclusion \"If I exercise and eat junk food, I will lose weight\" is a non-sequitur, as eating junk food has no logical connection to weight loss.\n\nIn other words, just because someone exercises, it does not mean that they will automatically lose weight, especially if they consume unhealthy foods. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid and cannot be accepted as true.\n\nAnswer: No",
