If the match is struck, then it will light (premise)\n2. If the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will light (conclusion)\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises, as the act of soaking the match in water does not affect the ability of the match to light if it is already struck. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
