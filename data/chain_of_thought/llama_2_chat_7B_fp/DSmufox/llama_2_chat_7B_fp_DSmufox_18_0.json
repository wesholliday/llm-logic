The first premise states that the shank must not be nugged, and the second premise states that either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n1. If the shank is not nugged, then it must be plooked.\n2. If the shank is nugged, then it cannot be plooked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can conclude that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
