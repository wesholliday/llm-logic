            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" implies a causal relationship between the two events, where the occurrence of one event (sproinging) leads to the occurrence of the other event (garpling). In other words, if the wug was sproinged, it must have been garpled.\n\nHowever, the statement \"If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled\" does not necessarily follow from the original statement. While it is possible that if the wug was not sproinged, it was not garpled, there could be other factors at play that would prevent garpling from occurring, even if the wug was not sproinged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled\" solely based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
