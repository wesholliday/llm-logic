In other words, if the smonk is vreebled, it will necessarily be plagged.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"If the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged\" implies that there is no direct causal relationship between the smonk not being vreebled and the smonk not being plagged. In other words, if the smonk is not vreebled, it does not necessarily follow that the smonk will not be plagged.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer that \"If the smonk was not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
