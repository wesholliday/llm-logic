In this case, the antecedent is \"the smip was shripped\" and the consequent is \"the smip lupped the zoint.\"\n\nTo see why this argument is invalid, let's consider an alternative scenario:\n\nSuppose the smip was not shripped. In this case, we cannot conclude that the smip did not lup the zoint, because the sentence does not provide any evidence to support this claim. In fact, it is possible that the smip did lup the zoint even if it was not shripped.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the smip was not shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint\" from the given sentence. The argument is invalid and does not follow logically.\n\nAnswer: No",
