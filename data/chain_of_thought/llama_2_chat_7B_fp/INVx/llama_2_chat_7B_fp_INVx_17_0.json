Therefore, if we want to infer the opposite statement, we need to consider the opposite of the causal relationship.\n\nIn this case, the opposite of \"being skizzled causes the flob to move\" is \"not being skizzled does not cause the flob to move.\" This means that if the flob was not skizzled, it did not move.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"If the flob was not skizzled, then the flob was not movated\" is \"yes.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
