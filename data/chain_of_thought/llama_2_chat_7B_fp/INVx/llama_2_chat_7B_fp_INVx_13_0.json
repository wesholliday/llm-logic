In other words, if the glip was slogged, it must have been tragged.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer the opposite statement, \"If the glip was not slogged, then the glip was not tragged.\" To answer this, we need to consider the logical implications of the given statement.\n\nIf the glip was not slogged, it means that the glip was not subjected to the causal relationship implied by the statement \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\" Therefore, we can infer that if the glip was not slogged, it was not tragged.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
