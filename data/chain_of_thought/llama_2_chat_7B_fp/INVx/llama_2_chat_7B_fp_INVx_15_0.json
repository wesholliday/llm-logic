            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a logical puzzle, and we need to use the information provided to arrive at a conclusion. The statement suggests that there is a relationship between the state of the dreb (whether it was vroombed or not) and the state of the spened (whether it was spened or not).\n\nTo infer the second statement, we need to apply the logical rule of inverse relationship. If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened, which means that if the dreb was not vroombed, it was not spened. Therefore, the answer to the question is 'yes'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
