In other words, if the fleeg is bluttered, it will necessarily surn.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"If the fleeg was not bluttered, then it did not surn\" implies a negation of the previous statement, meaning that if the fleeg is not bluttered, it will not surn.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether we can infer the second statement from the first one. To do this, we need to check if the conclusion of the first statement logically follows from its premise.\n\nIn this case, the premise of the first statement is \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\" The conclusion of the first statement is \"It surned.\"\n\nWe can see that the conclusion logically follows from the premise, as if the fleeg is bluttered, it will necessarily surn. Therefore, we can infer the second statement \"If the fleeg was not bluttered, then it did not surn\" from the first statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
