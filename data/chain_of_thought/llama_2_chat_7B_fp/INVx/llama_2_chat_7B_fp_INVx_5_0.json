            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\" is a logical inference, where the word \"fraggled\" is used to imply a certain state of being, and the word \"smoogled\" is used to imply the opposite state of being. In this case, the two states are mutually exclusive, meaning that if the zinger is fraggled, it cannot also be smoogled, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the zinger was not fraggled, it was not smoogled. This is because if the zinger was not fraggled, it cannot be smoogled, by the very definition of the terms.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
