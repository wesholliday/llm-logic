If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sprot the frink.\n2. The sneg was not crampled.\n\nTo infer whether we can draw the conclusion \"If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink,\" we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe conclusion is drawn based on the first premise, which states that if the sneg was crampled, then it sprot the frink. Since the second premise states that the sneg was not crampled, we can conclude that the sneg did not sprot the frink.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
