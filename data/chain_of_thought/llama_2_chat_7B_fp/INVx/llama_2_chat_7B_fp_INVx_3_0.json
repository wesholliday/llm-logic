However, it does not provide any information about the absence of morphing leading to the non-quanking of the splat.\n\nTo infer that \"If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank,\" we would need additional information or context that establishes a logical connection between the two events. Without this additional information, we cannot make a definitive conclusion that the splat did not quank simply because it was not morphed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'no'.",
