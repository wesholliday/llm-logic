The condition is \"the project must have been completed by Friday\" and the consequence is \"the project must have been completed by Friday or extended.\"\n\nTo infer whether \"The project must have been completed by Friday\" from the given statement, we need to analyze the conditional statement and determine the probability of the condition being true.\n\nThe statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday\" is a necessary condition for the consequence \"the project must have been completed by Friday or extended\" to occur. This means that if the project is not completed by Friday, it will be extended.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we can infer that \"The project must have been completed by Friday\" with a probability of 1, as it is a necessary condition for the consequence to occur.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
