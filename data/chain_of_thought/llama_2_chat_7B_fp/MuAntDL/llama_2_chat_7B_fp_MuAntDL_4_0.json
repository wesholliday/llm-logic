It does not provide any information about the possibility of the meeting being rescheduled or postponed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we cannot infer that the meeting must have been at 2 PM. The statement only provides two possible outcomes: the meeting took place at 2 PM or the meeting was cancelled.\n\nAnswer: No",
