This is because the phrase \"or upon request\" suggests that the room could have been cleaned more frequently than once a day, but the statement still implies that it was cleaned at least once a day.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the room must have been cleaned daily. The statement only implies that it was cleaned at least once a day, or upon request.\n\nAnswer: No",
