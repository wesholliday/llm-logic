The phrase \"or notarized\" suggests that the document could have been signed and then notarized, or that it could have been notarized without being signed.\n\nTherefore, based on this statement, we cannot infer that the document must have been signed. It is possible that the document was notarized without being signed, or that it was signed but not notarized.\n\nAnswer: No",
