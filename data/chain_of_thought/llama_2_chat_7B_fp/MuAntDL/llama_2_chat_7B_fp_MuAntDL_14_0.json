It does not explicitly state that the contract must be valid for a year.\n\nTo infer that the contract must have been valid for a year, we would need additional information or context that supports this conclusion. For example, if the statement is part of a larger sentence or passage that provides more context, we might be able to infer that the contract was indeed valid for a year.\n\nAnswer: No",
