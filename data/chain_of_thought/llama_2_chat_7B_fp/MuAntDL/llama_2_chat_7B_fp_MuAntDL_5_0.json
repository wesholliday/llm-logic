It does not explicitly state that the package was delivered yesterday, but rather provides two possible options for when it could have been delivered.\n\nTo infer that the package was delivered yesterday, we would need to use the information provided in the statement to make a logical conclusion. Since the statement only provides two options, we can conclude that the package was delivered on either yesterday or the day before, but not both. Therefore, the most likely option is that the package was delivered yesterday.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
