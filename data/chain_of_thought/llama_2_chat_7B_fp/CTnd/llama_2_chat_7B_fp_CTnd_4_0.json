To see why, let's break down the argument:\n\nIf Ben studied, then he did not study diligently (premise)\nIf Ben studied diligently, then he did not study (conclusion)\n\nThe conclusion does not logically follow from the premise because the phrase \"did not study diligently\" implies that Ben did not study with great effort or attention, but it does not necessarily mean that he did not study at all. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Ben studied, he did not study.\n\nAnswer: No",
