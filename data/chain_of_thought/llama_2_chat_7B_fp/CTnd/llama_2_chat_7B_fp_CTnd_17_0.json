To see why, let's break down the argument:\n\nIf the customer was greeted, then they were not greeted warmly.\n\nThis means that if the customer was greeted, it must be the case that they were not greeted warmly. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the customer was greeted warmly, they were not greeted.\n\nThe argument is trying to imply that if the customer was greeted warmly, it must be the case that they were not greeted at all. But this is not necessarily true. It's possible for a customer to be greeted warmly and still be greeted.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the customer was greeted warmly, they were not greeted. The argument is based on a false premise, and the conclusion does not logically follow.\n\nAnswer: No.",
