The argument is:\n\nIf Ann exercised, then she did not exercise strenuously.\n\nFrom this argument, we can infer that if Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise. However, this conclusion is not logically justified, as the premise does not necessarily lead to the conclusion.\n\nHere's why:\n\nThe premise \"If Ann exercised, then she did not exercise strenuously\" implies that if Ann did exercise, then she did not exercise with a high level of intensity or effort. However, this does not necessarily mean that if Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise. It's possible for Ann to have exercised both strenuously and non-strenuously.\n\nTherefore, the argument is flawed, and we cannot infer that if Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise. The correct conclusion would be \"Neither can we infer that if Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
