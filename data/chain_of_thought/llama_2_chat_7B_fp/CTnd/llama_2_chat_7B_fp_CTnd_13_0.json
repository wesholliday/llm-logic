In other words, if Alex did exercise, then it is possible that he did not exercise much, but it is not necessarily true.\n\nTo infer the second statement, \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise,\" we need to reverse the condition and consequence of the first statement. However, this inference is not valid. The second statement implies that if Alex exercised a lot, then he did exercise, which is the opposite of what the first statement suggests.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'no.'",
