A non sequitur is a statement that does not logically follow from the previous statement. In this case, the argument is attempting to draw a conclusion about the absence of instructions based on the fact that they were not explained clearly.\n\nHowever, the two statements are not related in a logical manner. Just because instructions were not explained clearly does not necessarily mean that they were not given. There could be many reasons why instructions were not explained clearly, such as a lack of time, a lack of knowledge on the part of the speaker, or a deliberate choice to omit certain details.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if instructions were not explained clearly, then they were not given. The two statements are not logically connected, and we cannot make a conclusion based on a non sequitur.\n\nAnswer: No",
