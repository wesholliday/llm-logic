In this case, the premise is \"If a recommendation was made, then it was not a strong recommendation.\" To infer the conclusion, we need to reverse the logic of the argument.\n\nIf a strong recommendation was made, then it means that the recommendation was strong, which contradicts the premise. Therefore, we can infer that if a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was made.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
