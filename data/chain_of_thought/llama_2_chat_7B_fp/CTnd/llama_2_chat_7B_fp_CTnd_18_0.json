This means that if the issue was discussed, it was not discussed to a sufficient level of detail to warrant further consideration.\n\nThe conclusion \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed\" is derived by negating the premise. If the issue was discussed in depth, it means that it was discussed thoroughly and in detail, which contradicts the premise. Therefore, the conclusion \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed\" is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
