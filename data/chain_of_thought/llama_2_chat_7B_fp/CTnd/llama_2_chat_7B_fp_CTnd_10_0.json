If we can infer that the advice offered was not helpful, then we can conclude that the advice was not helpful.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered\" from the given statement. The statement only implies that the advice offered was not helpful, not that no advice was offered.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'no.'",
