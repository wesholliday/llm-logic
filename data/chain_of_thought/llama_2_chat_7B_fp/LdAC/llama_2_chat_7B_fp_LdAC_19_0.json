            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo deduce whether we can logically deduce \"Tom watched football\" from the given premises, we need to apply the rules of logical reasoning.\n\nFrom the first premise \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball,\" we can infer that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nFrom the second premise \"Jen watched basketball,\" we can directly conclude that Jen watched basketball.\n\nNow, we need to use the transitive property of inference to deduce \"Tom watched football.\" The transitive property states that if A is related to B, and B is related to C, then A is related to C.\n\nApplying this property, if Tom is related to football (if Tom watched football), and football is related to basketball (since Jen watched basketball), then Tom is related to basketball (since Tom watched football).\n\nTherefore, we can logically deduce \"Tom watched football\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
