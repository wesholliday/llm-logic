The argument is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This means that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n\nNow, we are given an additional premise: \"The book is a mystery novel.\" This premise tells us that the book in question is indeed a mystery novel, given that it was written by James.\n\nUsing the logical structure of the argument, we can now ask ourselves: If the book was written by James, then what? The answer is: The book is a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, we can logically deduce \"The book was written by James\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
