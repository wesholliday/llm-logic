            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo deduce whether we can logically deduce \"The doll was plastic\" from the given premises, we need to follow the logical chain of reasoning.\n\nFrom the first premise \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal,\" we can infer that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is not metal.\n\nFrom the second premise \"The truck was metal,\" we can directly conclude that the truck is metal.\n\nNow, we need to use the first premise to deduce the conclusion about the doll. If the doll is plastic, then the truck is not metal, which means that the doll cannot be metal. Therefore, we can logically deduce \"The doll was plastic.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
