If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (premise 1)\n2. Sue was at the wedding (premise 2)\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that Mary was at the wedding if Sue was at the wedding. This is because if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary must have been at the wedding as well, given the logical connection between the two statements.\n\nTherefore, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
