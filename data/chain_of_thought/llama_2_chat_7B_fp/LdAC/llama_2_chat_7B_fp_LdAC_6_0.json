The premises given are:\n\n1. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n2. Bob chose pasta.\n\nUsing the first premise, we can infer that if Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza. This is because the premise states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta, and Bob has already chosen pasta. Therefore, we can conclude that Sue must have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
