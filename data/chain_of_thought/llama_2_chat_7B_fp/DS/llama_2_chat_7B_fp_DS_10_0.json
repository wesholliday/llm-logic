In this case, the argument states that either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it's under the bed, and the second premise states that the missing sock isn't under the bed.\n\nTo apply the rules of disjunctive syllogism, we need to consider the two possible conclusions that can be drawn from the given premises:\n\n1. If the missing sock is not under the bed, then it must be in the laundry basket.\n2.
