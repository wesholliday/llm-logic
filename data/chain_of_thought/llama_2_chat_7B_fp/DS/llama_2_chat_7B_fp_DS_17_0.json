If the scarf is not on the coat rack, then it must be in the backpack. However, the additional information that the scarf isn't on the coat rack eliminates the possibility that it is on the coat rack, leaving us with only the option that it is in the backpack. Therefore, the conclusion that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack follows logically from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
