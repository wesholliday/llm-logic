In other words, if Sam takes a plane, then Erin must take a train.\n\nNext, we know that 'Erin took a train' is true, so we can apply the implication from the first statement to conclude that Sam must have taken a plane. In other words, if Erin took a train, then Sam must have taken a plane.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
