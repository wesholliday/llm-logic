            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nIn this argument, we are given two premises: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and \"The truck was blue.\" We need to determine whether the conclusion \"The car was red\" follows logically from these premises.\n\nTo do this, we can use the logical operator \"implication.\" If the first premise is true, and the second premise is true, then we can infer that the conclusion \"The car was red\" is true. This is because if the car was red, and the truck was blue, then the car must have been red.\n\nTherefore, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
