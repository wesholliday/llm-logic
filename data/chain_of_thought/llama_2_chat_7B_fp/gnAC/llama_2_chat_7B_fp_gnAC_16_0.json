            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nIf the statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is true, and we know that \"The pants were denim\" is true, we can use logical reasoning to determine whether it follows that \"The shirt was cotton\" is true.\n\nTo do this, we can use the logical connector \"therefore\" to link the two statements. In this case, we can write:\n\nIf the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim (true)\nThe pants were denim (true)\nTherefore, the shirt was cotton (true)\n\nHowever, we need to be careful when using this logical connector, as it only applies when the two statements are logically connected. In this case, we are assuming that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim, which is a true statement. But we cannot assume that the shirt was cotton simply because the pants were denim.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Does it necessarily follow that 'The shirt was cotton' is true?\" is no. We cannot logically deduce that the shirt was cotton based solely on the fact that the pants were denim.",
