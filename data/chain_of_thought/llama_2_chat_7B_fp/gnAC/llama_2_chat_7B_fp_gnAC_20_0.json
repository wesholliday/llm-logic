            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nIn this argument, we are given two premises:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n2. The banana was yellow.\n\nWe need to determine whether the conclusion \"The apple was red\" follows logically from these premises.\n\nTo do this, we can use the logical operator \"implication.\" If the first premise implies the second premise, then we can conclude that the first premise implies the conclusion. In other words, if the first premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nSo, let's evaluate the implication between the premises:\n\nIf the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. (Premise 1)\nThe banana was yellow. (Premise 2)\n\nIf the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. (Premise 1) \u2234 The apple was red. (Conclusion)\n\nHere, we are using the logical operator \"\u2234\" to indicate that the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nNow, we can answer the question:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
