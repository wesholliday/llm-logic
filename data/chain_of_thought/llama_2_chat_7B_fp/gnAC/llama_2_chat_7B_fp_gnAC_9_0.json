            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nIn this situation, we are given two statements: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" and \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" We need to determine whether it follows that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true.\n\nTo do this, we can use the logical connector \"then\" to link the two statements. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" means that if Lisa purchased the red shirt, then Mark must have purchased the blue shirt.\n\nNow, we are given that \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true. This means that the first statement in the conditional chain is true, i.e., \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\" Therefore, we can conclude that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
