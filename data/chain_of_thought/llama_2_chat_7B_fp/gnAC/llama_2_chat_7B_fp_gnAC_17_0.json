            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nIn order to determine whether it follows that 'Ben ate pasta' is true given that 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad' and 'Kate ate salad' are both true, we need to carefully analyze the given statements.\n\nThe first statement, 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad,' implies that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. This means that there is a direct causal relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating salad.\n\nThe second statement, 'Kate ate salad,' simply states that Kate did indeed eat salad.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the first statement provides enough information to logically deduce that Ben ate pasta. In other words, can we conclude that Ben ate pasta simply based on the fact that Kate ate salad?\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the possibility of alternative scenarios. For example, it's possible that Ben did not eat pasta, but Kate still ate salad. In this case, the first statement would be true, but the second statement would also be true, and we would not be able to deduce that Ben ate pasta based solely on the given information.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that it does not necessarily follow that 'Ben ate pasta' is true given that 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad' and 'Kate ate salad' are both true. The information provided does not provide sufficient evidence to logically deduce that Ben ate pasta.\n\nAnswer: No",
