            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether it follows that 'Tom watched football' is true based on the given premises, we need to use logical reasoning.\n\nPremise 1: If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\nPremise 2: Jen watched basketball.\n\nFrom these premises, we can deduce the following:\n\nIf Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. (Premise 1)\nJen watched basketball. (Premise 2)\n\nBy using the transitive property of equality, we can conclude that if Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football.\n\nTransitive property of equality: If A = B and B = C, then A = C.\n\nApplying this property to the above scenario, we get:\nJen watched basketball (Premise 2)\nJen = Tom (If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball)\nTom watched football (Premise 1)\nTherefore, Tom watched football.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
