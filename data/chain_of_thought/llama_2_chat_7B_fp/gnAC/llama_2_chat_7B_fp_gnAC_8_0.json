            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nIn this argument, we are given two premises:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n2. The mummy was awake.\n\nWe need to determine whether the conclusion \"The vampire was awake\" follows logically from these premises.\n\nTo do this, we can use the logical operator \"Material Implication\" (\u2234). It states that if the first premise is true, then the second premise must also be true. In other words, if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake, so if the mummy was awake, the vampire must have been awake.\n\nUsing this operator, we can write:\n\n\u2234 The vampire was awake \u2192 The mummy was awake\n\nNow, we are asked to determine whether the conclusion \"The vampire was awake\" follows from the premises. To answer this, we need to evaluate the truth of the conditional statement above.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
