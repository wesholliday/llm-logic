            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether it follows that 'The alien visited Mars' is true if 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter' and 'The robot visited Jupiter' are both true, we need to use logical reasoning.\n\nFirstly, we know that 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter' is true, so we can write 'A \u2192 B' (where 'A' represents 'the alien visited Mars' and 'B' represents 'the robot visited Jupiter').\n\nNext, we know that 'The robot visited Jupiter' is true, so we can write 'B'.\n\nUsing the logical implication operator '\u2192', we can infer that if 'A' is true (i.e., the alien visited Mars), then 'B' (i.e., the robot visited Jupiter) must also be true. Therefore, we can write 'A \u2192 B'.\n\nNow, we are asked to determine whether it follows that 'The alien visited Mars' is true if 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter' and 'The robot visited Jupiter' are both true.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to use the logical equivalence operator '\u2194'. We can write 'A \u2194 B' to indicate that 'A' and 'B' are logically equivalent, meaning that if one is true, then the other must also be true.\n\nUsing the above logical reasoning, we can write 'A \u2194 B'.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
