However, it does not necessarily imply that the project will be completed on time or within budget.\n\nTo infer that the project might be completed by Friday and be under budget, we would need additional information or context that suggests that the project is on track to meet its financial goals. For example, if the project manager has provided updates on the project's progress and budget, and those updates indicate that the project is on track to be completed by Friday and stay within budget, then we could infer that the project might be completed by Friday and be under budget.\n\nAnswer: No",
