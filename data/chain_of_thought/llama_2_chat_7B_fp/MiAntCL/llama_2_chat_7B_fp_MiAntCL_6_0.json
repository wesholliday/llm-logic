However, it does not necessarily imply that the concert starts at 8 PM. The statement only suggests that there may not be any tickets available, and it does not provide any information about the start time of the concert.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the concert starts at 8 PM just based on the statement \"The concert might be sold out.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
