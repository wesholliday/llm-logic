            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe sentence \"The application might be completed online\" suggests that the application can be submitted electronically, through a digital platform, rather than through traditional paper-based methods. However, it does not necessarily imply that the application will include references.\n\nTo determine whether the application will include references, we need to consider the context of the sentence and any additional information provided. In this case, there is no additional information provided, so we cannot infer that the application will include references. Therefore, our answer is 'no'.\n\nAnswer: no",
