            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe sentence \"The package might be delivered today\" implies that the package could potentially be delivered on the current day, but it does not provide any information about whether it will be signed for or not. The sentence simply states that the package might arrive on the current day, without providing any additional details.\n\nOn the other hand, the phrase \"signed for\" implies that someone will need to be present to receive the package and sign for it. This means that if the package is delivered today, it will need to be signed for by someone.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the package might be delivered today and signed for. The sentence \"The package might be delivered today\" does not provide enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
