It's possible that the exam might focus on a specific area or topic, rather than covering everything.\n\nTo infer that the exam will cover all chapters, we would need additional information or context. For example, if the instructor specifically mentioned that the exam will cover all chapters, or if the exam format suggests that it will be comprehensive (e.g., multiple choice questions that cover all topics), then we could infer that the exam will indeed cover all chapters.\n\nAnswer: No",
