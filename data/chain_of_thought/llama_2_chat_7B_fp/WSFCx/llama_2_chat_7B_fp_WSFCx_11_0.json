In fact, the statement explicitly states that the froodle might be either quork or snorkel, but not both.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the froodle might be quork and it might be snorkel. The statement only provides two possible options, and there is no logical basis to suggest that the froodle might be both.\n\nAnswer: No",
