            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument presented is in the form of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a type of argument that uses \"either-or\" statements to reach a conclusion. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\nPremise 2: The mummy was awake.\nConclusion: The vampire was awake.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate the validity of each premise and the logical connection between them.\n\nPremise 1: This premise is true. If the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake, by definition.\n\nPremise 2: This premise is true. The mummy is awake, according to the argument.\n\nConclusion: Based on the premises, the conclusion that the vampire is awake follows logically. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
