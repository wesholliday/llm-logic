Jen watched basketball.\n\nThe conclusion that follows from these premises is: Tom watched football.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No.\n\nThe argument is not logically valid because the second premise does not necessarily imply that Tom watched football. It only states that Jen watched basketball, which does not provide any information about Tom's actions. Therefore, the conclusion that Tom watched football cannot be logically deduced from the premises.",
