The argument is valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and it is invalid if the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we need to evaluate whether the premises provide sufficient evidence to support the conclusion. In this case, the first premise states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. This means that if Sue made a particular choice, Bob must have made the opposite choice. The second premise states that Bob chose pasta.\n\nUsing the information provided in the premises, we can deduce the conclusion that Sue chose pizza. This means that if Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
