To determine the validity of the argument, we need to evaluate whether the premises lead to a logical conclusion.\n\nThe first premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This means that if Alex completed the race, then it is true that Chris finished the race.\n\nThe second premise states that Chris finished the race is true. This means that Chris did complete the race.\n\nUsing the first premise and the second premise, we can conclude that Alex finished the race. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
