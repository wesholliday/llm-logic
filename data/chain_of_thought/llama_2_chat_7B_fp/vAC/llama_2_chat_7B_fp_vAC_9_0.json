Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nThe conclusion that follows from these premises is: Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion does logically follow from the premises, as the first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt, and the second premise states that Mark bought the blue shirt. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
