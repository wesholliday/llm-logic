            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument we are considering is in the form of modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus ponens is a form of argument that takes the form \"If A, then B; A, therefore B.\" In this case, the first premise is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel,\" the second premise is \"The book is a mystery novel,\" and the conclusion is \"The book was written by James.\"\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate the premises and the conclusion. If the premises are true and the conclusion logically follows from the premises, then the argument is valid.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This premise is true, as the book's authorship can be known and it is a mystery novel.\n\nThe second premise is \"The book is a mystery novel.\" This premise is also true, as the book's genre can be known and it is indeed a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The book was written by James\" logically follows from the premises, and the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
