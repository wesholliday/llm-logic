However, we are also given that Erin might not have taken a train. To determine whether we can infer that Sam did not take a plane, we need to consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. If Erin took a train, then Sam must have taken a plane. In this case, we cannot infer that Sam did not take a plane, as the argument states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n2. If Erin did not take a train, then Sam might have taken a plane. In this case, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane, as the argument states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train, and since Erin did not take a train, Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
