However, the second premise states that Kate might not have eaten salad. We need to analyze the implications of these two premises to determine the conclusion.\n\nIf Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad, which means that if Kate did not eat salad, Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nNow, we are given the additional premise that Kate might not have eaten salad. This means that there is a possibility that Kate did not eat salad, even if Ben ate pasta.\n\nSo, we can conclude that Ben did not eat pasta based on the premises given.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
