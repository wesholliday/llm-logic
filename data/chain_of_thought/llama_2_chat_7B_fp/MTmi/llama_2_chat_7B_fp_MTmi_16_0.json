If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton.\n2. If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\n\nIn scenario 1, the statement \"The shirt was cotton\" is true, and in scenario 2, the statement \"The shirt was not cotton\" is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer \"The shirt was not cotton\" with certainty.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
