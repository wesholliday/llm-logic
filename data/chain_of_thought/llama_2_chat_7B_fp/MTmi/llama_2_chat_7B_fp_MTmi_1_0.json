            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on the premise that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. However, we are also given that Sue might not have been at the wedding. To determine whether we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nIf Sue might not have been at the wedding, it means that we cannot conclude that Mary was at the wedding simply based on the fact that Mary was at the wedding. In other words, the premise \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\" weakens the conclusion \"Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"Mary was not at the wedding\" based on the given premises. The argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
