However, the second premise states that the robot might not have visited Jupiter. To determine whether we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars, we need to evaluate the relationship between the two premises.\n\nIf the robot did not visit Jupiter, then it is possible that the alien visited Mars. In this case, we cannot infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nOn the other hand, if the robot did visit Jupiter, then it is not possible that the alien visited Mars. In this case, we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
