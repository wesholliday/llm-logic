            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument provided is a classic example of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a type of argument that involves two exclusive possibilities. In this case, the argument states that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel, and if the book is not a mystery novel, then it was not written by James.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The book was not written by James\" from the given premises, we need to evaluate the two possibilities presented in the argument.\n\nIf the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. This means that if the book is not a mystery novel, it cannot have been written by James.\n\nThe book might not be a mystery novel. This possibility implies that the book could have been written by someone else, or that it might not have been written at all.\n\nBased on these two possibilities, we can conclude that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. However, if the book is not a mystery novel, then it could have been written by someone else or might not have been written at all. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The book was not written by James\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
