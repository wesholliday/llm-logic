            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on the premise that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. However, the second premise states that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. To infer whether Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we need to consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. Lisa bought the red shirt: If Lisa did buy the red shirt, then Mark's failure to buy the blue shirt does not affect the fact that Lisa made the purchase. Therefore, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Answer: No.\n2. Lisa did not buy the red shirt: If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark's failure to buy the blue shirt does not matter. In this case, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Answer: Yes.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt if the second premise is true.",
