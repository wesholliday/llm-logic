            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The doll was not plastic\" from the given statements, we need to analyze the relationships between the variables involved.\n\nFrom the first statement, \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal,\" we can conclude that if the doll is plastic, the truck cannot be metal. This means that if the doll is not plastic, the truck must be metal.\n\nNow, consider the second statement, \"The truck might not have been metal.\" This statement tells us that there is a possibility that the truck is not metal, which means that the doll could be plastic.\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that there is a possibility that the doll is plastic, which means that we cannot infer \"The doll was not plastic\" from the given statements. Therefore, the answer is \"No.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
