This means that if the muffins were not blueberry, we can conclude that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nHowever, the second statement suggests that the muffins might not have been blueberry. This means that we cannot directly conclude that the cake was not chocolate based solely on the fact that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The cake was not chocolate\" from the given statements. The information provided is insufficient to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No",
