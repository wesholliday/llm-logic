However, the second premise, \"Lucy might not have gone to the zoo,\" introduces a possibility that contradicts the conclusion. If Lucy might not have gone to the zoo, then it is not necessarily true that if Joe went to the park, Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park based on the given premises. The argument is invalid, and we cannot make any conclusions about Joe's park visit.\n\nAnswer: No",
