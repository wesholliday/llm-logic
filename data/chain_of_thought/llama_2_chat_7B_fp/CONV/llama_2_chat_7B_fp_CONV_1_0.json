            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument being presented is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as Affirming the Consequent. In this type of fallacy, the conclusion is drawn based on the premise that the consequent (in this case, \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\") is true, simply because the antecedent (in this case, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\") is true. However, this is not a valid logical argument, as the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nTo see why, consider the following counterexample:\n\nSuppose that Mary and Sue are two people who are known to be identical twins, but they are separated at birth and raised apart. In this case, it is possible that Mary was at the wedding, but Sue was not. Therefore, the argument \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is false, and we cannot infer that \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\" is true.\n\nAnswer: No",
