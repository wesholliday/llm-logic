In this case, the premise is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This means that if Alex completed the race, then Chris also completed the race, as they are linked in some way.\n\nTo infer the opposite conclusion, we need to use the same logical reasoning. If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race. This is because Chris and Alex are linked in some way, and if Chris completed the race, then Alex must have also completed the race.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
