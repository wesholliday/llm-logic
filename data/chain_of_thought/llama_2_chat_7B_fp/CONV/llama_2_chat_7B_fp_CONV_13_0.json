            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument being presented is a logical deduction based on the premise \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This premise is stating that there is a relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck, where if the car is red, then the truck is blue.\n\nTo infer whether we can conclude \"If the truck was blue, then the car was red\" from the given premise, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe key to this argument is the word \"then.\" It implies a causal relationship between the two statements, suggesting that if the car is red, the truck will be blue, and vice versa. Therefore, we can conclude that if the truck was blue, then the car was red.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
