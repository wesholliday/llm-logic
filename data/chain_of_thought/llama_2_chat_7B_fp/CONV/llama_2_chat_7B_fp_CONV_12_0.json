Since we know that If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo, we can conclude that if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe must have gone to the park as well.\n\nThis is because the logical relationship between Joe and Lucy's actions is symmetrical, meaning that if one of them goes to a certain place, the other must also go to the same place. Therefore, if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe must have gone to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
