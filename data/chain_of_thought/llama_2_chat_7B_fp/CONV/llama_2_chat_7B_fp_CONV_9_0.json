            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nIn this argument, we are given two premises: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" and \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\" We need to determine whether we can infer the conclusion \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt\" from these premises.\n\nTo do this, we can use the principle of transitivity, which states that if A implies B, and B implies C, then A implies C. In this case, we have a chain of implications:\n\n1. Lisa bought the red shirt (A) implies Mark bought the blue shirt (B)\n2. Mark bought the blue shirt (B) implies Lisa bought the red shirt (C)\n\nSince the conclusion follows directly from the premises, we can infer \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
