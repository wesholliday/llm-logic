            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument being presented is a classic example of a logical deduction. We are given two premises:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n2. The book is a mystery novel.\n\nWe need to deduce the conclusion based on the given premises. To do this, we use the logical operator \"then,\" which allows us to draw a conclusion based on the information provided in the premises.\n\nIn this case, we can deduce the conclusion \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James\" by applying the logical operator \"then\" to the premises:\n\nIf the book is a mystery novel (premise 2),\nthen the book was written by James (premise 1).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
