To determine if we can infer the opposite conclusion, we need to evaluate the argument's structure and logic.\n\nThe argument is a form of affirming the antecedent, which is a type of logical fallacy. The fallacy occurs when the conclusion is based solely on the premise, without considering any additional information or evidence that may contradict the conclusion. In this case, we are asked to infer that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red, solely based on the premise that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'no', we cannot infer that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red. The argument is based on a flawed premise and lacks sufficient evidence to support the conclusion.",
