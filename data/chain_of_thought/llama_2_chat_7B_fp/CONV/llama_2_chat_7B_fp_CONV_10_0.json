This law states that a statement and its negation cannot both be true.\n\nIn this case, the premise is \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This means that if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\n\nNow, let's consider the negation of the premise, which is \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside.\" This means that if the cat was outside, then the dog must have been inside.\n\nHowever, we know that the premise is true, so we can conclude that the negation of the premise is false. This means that \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside\" cannot be inferred from the given premise.\n\nAnswer: No",
