However, the conclusion states that it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. To infer whether Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we need to analyze the argument further.\n\nIf Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt, since the argument states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. Therefore, if the conclusion is not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
