            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument presented is a classic example of a disjunctive syllogism, where two premises are given, and from them, we must infer a conclusion. In this case, the premises are:\n\n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\n2. It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer the conclusion that the shirt was not cotton. Here's how:\n\nIf the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim (premise 1).\nBut it's not the case that the pants must have been denim (premise 2).\n\nSo, if the shirt was cotton, then it must not have been denim. Therefore, the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
