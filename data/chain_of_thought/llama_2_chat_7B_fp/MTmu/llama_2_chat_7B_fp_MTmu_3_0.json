            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument provided is a classic example of a disjunctive syllogism, which means that we have two premises that lead to two possible conclusions. The first premise is \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" The second premise is \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\"\n\nTo determine the conclusion we can draw from these premises, we need to consider the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion. If the first premise is true, then the conclusion \"The book was written by James\" follows logically. However, if the second premise is true, then the conclusion \"The book was not written by James\" also follows logically.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The book was not written by James\" solely based on the given premises. The argument is invalid, and we cannot draw a conclusion about the authorship of the book.\n\nAnswer: No",
