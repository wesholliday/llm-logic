It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\n\nFrom these premises, we can deduce the following conclusion:\n\nConclusion: The car was not red.\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo deduce the conclusion, we need to use the logical rule of inference known as modus tollens. This rule states that if a conclusion follows from two premises, and one of the premises is false, then the conclusion must also be false.\n\nIn this case, if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue (premise 1). However, it's not the case that the truck must have been blue (premise 2). Therefore, we can conclude that the car was not red (conclusion).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
