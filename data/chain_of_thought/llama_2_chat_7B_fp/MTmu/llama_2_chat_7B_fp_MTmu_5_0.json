            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument presented is a classic example of a disjunctive syllogism, where two premises are given, and from them, it is concluded that one of the two possible conclusions must be true. In this case, the premises are:\n\n1. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n2. It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that the conclusion \"Jeff did not play basketball\" is true. Here's why:\n\nIf Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. (Premise 1)\nIf Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball. (Premise 2)\n\nFrom the second premise, we can conclude that Amy did not play tennis. Since we know that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis, and Amy did not play tennis, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
