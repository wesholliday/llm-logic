            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument presented is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as Affirming the Consequent. The argument is:\n\nIf the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\nIt's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\nTherefore, the apple was not red.\n\nThe problem with this argument is that the second premise does not necessarily follow from the first premise. Just because the apple is not yellow, it does not mean that the banana must have been yellow. There could be other reasons why the banana is not yellow, such as it being a different type of fruit or it not being present at all.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the apple was not red based on the given argument. The argument is flawed and does not logically follow.\n\nAnswer: No",
