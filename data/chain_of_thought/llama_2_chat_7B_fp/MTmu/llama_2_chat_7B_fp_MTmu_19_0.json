            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on the premise that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. However, the conclusion states that it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. To infer whether Tom did not watch football, we need to analyze the argument's structure and the information provided.\n\nThe argument is a disjunctive syllogism, which means that if one of the premises is true, the conclusion must be true. In this case, the premises are:\n\n1. If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n2. It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nSince the second premise contradicts the first premise, we can conclude that the first premise is false. Therefore, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
