            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" from the given premises, we need to apply the laws of logic. Specifically, we can use the law of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nFrom the premises \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" and \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt,\" we can deduce that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt, since the second premise states that Mark will buy the blue shirt if Lisa buys the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
