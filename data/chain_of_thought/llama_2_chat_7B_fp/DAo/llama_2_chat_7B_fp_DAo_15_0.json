This law states that a statement and its negation cannot both be true.\n\nFrom the first premise, \"Sam did not take a plane,\" we can infer that Sam did not fly.\n\nFrom the second premise, \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train,\" we can infer that if Sam flew, then Erin took a train.\n\nNow, we need to combine these two premises to infer a conclusion about Erin. If Sam did not fly (from the first premise), then Erin did not take a train (from the second premise). Therefore, we can conclude that Erin did not take a train.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
