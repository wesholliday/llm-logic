            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument provided is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" It is based on the idea that if the apple is not red, then the banana must be yellow. However, this conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nTo see why, let's analyze the argument:\n\n1. The apple was not red. (Premise)\n2. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. (Premise)\n3. Therefore, the banana was not yellow. (Inference)\n\nThe problem with this argument is that the second premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support the conclusion. Just because the apple is not red does not necessarily mean that the banana is not yellow. There could be other factors at play that would make the banana yellow, even if the apple is not red.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the banana was not yellow based solely on the premises provided. The argument is invalid and cannot be used to draw a conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No",
