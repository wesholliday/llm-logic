This means that if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest either.\n\nNow, we can use the \"Not\" operator to negate the previous statement. If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest. Therefore, we can infer that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
