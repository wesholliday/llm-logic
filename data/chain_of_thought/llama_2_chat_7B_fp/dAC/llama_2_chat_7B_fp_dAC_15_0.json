Modus ponens is a basic rule of reasoning that allows us to draw a conclusion from two premises, if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe premises in this case are:\n\n* If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train (premise 1)\n* Erin took a train (premise 2)\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can deduce the conclusion that Sam took a plane as follows:\n\n* If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train (premise 1)\n* Erin took a train (premise 2)\n* Therefore, Sam took a plane (conclusion)\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'yes'.",
