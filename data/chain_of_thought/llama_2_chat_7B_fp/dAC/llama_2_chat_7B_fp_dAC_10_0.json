Therefore, if the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside.\n\nNow, we are given the second premise, \"The cat was outside.\" Based on the first premise and the second premise, we can conclude that if the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside. Therefore, the answer to the question \"Can we deduce 'The dog was inside'?\" is \"No.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
