If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n2. Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nFrom these premises, we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Here's why:\n\nIf Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. (Premise 1)\nMark bought the blue shirt. (Premise 2)\n\nSince Mark bought the blue shirt, it means that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is because, if Lisa had bought the red shirt, Mark would have bought the blue shirt.
