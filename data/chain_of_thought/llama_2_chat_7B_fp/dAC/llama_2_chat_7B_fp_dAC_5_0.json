            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nIn order to deduce whether Jeff played basketball based on the information provided, we need to use the logical rule of inference known as modus ponens. Modus ponens is a basic rule of reasoning that allows us to draw a conclusion from two premises, if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nIn this case, the premises are \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" and \"Amy played tennis.\" Using modus ponens, we can deduce the conclusion \"Jeff played basketball\" because if Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball (by the given premise).\n\nTherefore, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
