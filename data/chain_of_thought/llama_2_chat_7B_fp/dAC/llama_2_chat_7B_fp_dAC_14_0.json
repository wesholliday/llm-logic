This is a logical consequence of the given premise.\n\nNow, we are given the second premise \"The wolf was in the den.\" This premise tells us that the wolf is indeed in the den, which means that we can use the first premise to deduce that the bear must be in the cave.\n\nTherefore, our conclusion is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
