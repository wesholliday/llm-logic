If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet was plopped.\n\nWe need to use logical reasoning to determine whether we can infer the statement \"The grommet was sploffed\" from the given statements.\n\nThe statement \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet was plopped\" implies that if a certain condition (being sploffed) occurs, then a certain action (being plopped) will also occur.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the condition \"The grommet was sploffed\" can be inferred from the given statements.\n\nFrom the first statement \"The grommet was plopped,\" we know that the grommet was in a certain state (plopped).\n\nFrom the second statement \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet was plopped,\" we know that if the grommet was in a certain state (sploffed), then it was also in the state of being plopped.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the grommet was sploffed, then it was also plopped.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
