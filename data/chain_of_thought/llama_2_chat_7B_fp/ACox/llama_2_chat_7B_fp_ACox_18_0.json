If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n\nWe want to know if we can infer the statement \"The sprocket was cranked\" from the given statements.\n\nTo do this, we can use the rule of inference known as modus ponens. This rule allows us to infer a conclusion from two premises, if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nSo, let's apply modus ponens to the given statements:\n\nPremise 1: The sprocket was daggled.\nPremise 2: If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\nConclusion: The sprocket was cranked.\n\nFrom the premises, we can logically deduce the conclusion that the sprocket was cranked. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
