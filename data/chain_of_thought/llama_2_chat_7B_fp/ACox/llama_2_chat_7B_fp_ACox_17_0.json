If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle was tinked.\n\nWe are asked to infer whether the statement \"The whiffle was shanked\" can be deduced from the given statements.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to analyze the relationship between the statements and see if they provide enough information to deduce the conclusion.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the whiffle was tinked. This could mean that the whiffle was tinked in any way, without any further information.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that if the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle was tinked. This means that if the whiffle was shanked, it must have been tinked in some way.\n\nNow, we need to use our reasoning to deduce whether the whiffle was shanked. We can do this by using the information provided in both statements. Since the whiffle was tinked in some way according to statement 1, and if it was shanked, then it must have been tinked according to statement 2, we can conclude that the whiffle was shanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
