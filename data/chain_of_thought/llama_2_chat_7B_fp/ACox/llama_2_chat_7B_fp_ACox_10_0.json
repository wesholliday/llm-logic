If the wug was sproinged, then it was garbled.\n\nWe are asked to infer whether the wug was sproinged based on the given statements. To do this, we need to use logical reasoning and follow the given conditions.\n\nIf the wug was sproinged, then it was garbled, according to the second statement. This means that if the wug was sproinged, it must have been garbled.\n\nNow, we are given that the wug was garbled. This means that the wug was either sproinged or garbled. Since we know that if the wug was sproinged, it was garbled, we can conclude that the wug was sproinged.\n\nTherefore, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
