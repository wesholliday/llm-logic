If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\n\nTo infer whether 'The splat was morphed' can be deduced from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical relationship between them.\n\nThe first statement, 'The splat quanked', provides no information about the morphing state of the splat. It simply states that the splat underwent some action.\n\nThe second statement, 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked', implies a causal relationship between the morphing state of the splat and the action of quanking. If the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the given statements provide enough information to deduce 'The splat was morphed'.\n\nAnswer: No",
