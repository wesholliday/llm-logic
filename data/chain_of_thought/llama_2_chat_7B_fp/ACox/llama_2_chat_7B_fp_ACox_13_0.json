If the splat was morphed, then the splat was quanked.\n\nWe need to use logical reasoning to determine whether we can infer 'The splat was morphed' from the given statements.\n\nIf we assume that 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat was quanked' is true, then we can conclude that the splat was quanked.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer 'The splat was morphed' from the given statements. The statement 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat was quanked' only provides a conditional relationship between 'morphed' and 'quanked', and does not guarantee that 'morphed' is true.\n\nTherefore, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
