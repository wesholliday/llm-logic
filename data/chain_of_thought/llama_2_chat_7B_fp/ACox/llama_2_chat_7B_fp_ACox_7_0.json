If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\n\nWe are asked to infer whether the statement \"The whiffle was shanked\" can be deduced from these two statements.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement \"The whiffle tinked\" tells us that the whiffle made a sound.\n\nThe second statement \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\" tells us that if the whiffle was shanked, it would make the same sound as it tinked.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot directly infer that the whiffle was shanked. The second statement only tells us that if the whiffle was shanked, it would make the same sound as it tinked, but it does not tell us whether the whiffle was actually shanked or not.\n\nTherefore, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
