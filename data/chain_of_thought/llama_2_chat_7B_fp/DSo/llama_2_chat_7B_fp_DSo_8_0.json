Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce the following logical conclusions:\n\n1. The remote control is not hiding under the couch.\n2. The remote control is either on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch.\n\nNow, let's analyze the second statement: \"The remote control is either on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch.\" This statement is a logical OR statement, which means that if the remote control is on the coffee table, it is not hiding under the couch, and if it is hiding under the couch, it is not on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can conclude that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
