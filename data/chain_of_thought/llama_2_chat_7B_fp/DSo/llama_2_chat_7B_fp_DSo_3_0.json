This rule allows us to draw a conclusion from two premises if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nIn this case, the premises are:\n\n1. The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet.\n2. Either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet.\n\nFrom these premises, we can logically conclude:\n\n3. The keys are not dangling in the cabinet.\n4. If the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, then they are in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The keys are in the drawer\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
