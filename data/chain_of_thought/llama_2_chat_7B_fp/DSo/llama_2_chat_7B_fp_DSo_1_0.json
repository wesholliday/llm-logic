In this case, the argument states that either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'Fido is inside' from the given argument, we need to evaluate the two possibilities presented in the argument. If Fido is inside, then he is not in the garden, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, based on the argument provided, we can infer 'Fido is inside' with certainty.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
