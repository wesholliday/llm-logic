From \"The book isn't resting on the table,\" we know that the book is not in a state of rest on the table. Therefore, if the book is not resting on the table, it must be somewhere else.\n\nFrom \"Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table,\" we know that there are only two possible locations for the book: either it is on the shelf or it is resting on the table. Since we have already established that the book is not resting on the table, the only remaining option is that it is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
