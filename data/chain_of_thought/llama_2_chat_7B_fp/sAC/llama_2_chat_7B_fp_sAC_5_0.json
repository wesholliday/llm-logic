            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, we are given two premises: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" and \"Amy played tennis.\" Based on these premises, we need to determine whether the conclusion \"Jeff played basketball\" can be logically deduced.\n\nTo do this, we can use the logical operator \"if-then\" to create a conditional statement:\n\nIf Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. (Premise 1)\nAmy played tennis. (Premise 2)\n\nUsing the conditional operator, we can rewrite the statement as:\n\nIf Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis \u2192 Amy played tennis. (Using the logical operator \"\u2192\" to connect the two premises)\n\nNow, we are given a third statement: \"Amy played tennis.\" This statement is true, so we can use it to deduce the conclusion:\n\nIf Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis \u2192 Amy played tennis. (Using the logical operator \"\u2192\" to connect the two premises)\nAmy played tennis. (Given statement)\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can logically deduce that \"Jeff played basketball\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
