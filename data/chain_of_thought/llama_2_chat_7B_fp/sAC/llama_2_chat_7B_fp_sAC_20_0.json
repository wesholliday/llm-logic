            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, we have two statements: 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' and 'The banana was yellow'. Both of these statements are true, so we can conclude that they are both logically valid.\n\nNow, we need to apply the logical implication rule to determine whether the conclusion 'The apple was red' can be drawn. The rule states that if 'If A, then B' and 'B', then we can conclude that 'A' is true.\n\nApplying this rule to our scenario, we have:\n\nIf the apple was red, then the banana was yellow (A)\nThe banana was yellow (B)\n\nSince both premises are true, we can conclude that the conclusion 'The apple was red' is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
