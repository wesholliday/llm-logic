If the first statement is true, it means that Sue chose pizza, and the second statement is true. Therefore, we can conclude that Bob chose pasta.\n\nNow, we are asked to determine whether it follows that \"Sue chose pizza\" is true. To answer this, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. Since \"Bob chose pasta\" is true, and \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta,\" it means that Sue chose pizza. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
