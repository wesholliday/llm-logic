            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, we are given two premises: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Sue was at the wedding.\" We need to use logical reasoning to determine whether it follows that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true.\n\nTo do this, we can use the logical connector \"then\" to link the two premises together. This allows us to deduce that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding as well.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that can be drawn is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
