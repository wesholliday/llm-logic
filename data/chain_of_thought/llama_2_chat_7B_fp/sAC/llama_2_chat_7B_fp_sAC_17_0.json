This rule allows us to deduce a conclusion from two premises if the premises are true.\n\nIn this case, the conclusion we want to deduce is 'Ben ate pasta'. To do this, we can start with the premise 'Kate ate salad' and use it to infer the premise 'Ben ate pasta' according to the rule of modus ponens.\n\nSo, the premises are 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad' and 'Kate ate salad'. Using modus ponens, we can deduce the conclusion 'Ben ate pasta'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
