This rule states that if A implies B, and B is true, then A must also be true.\n\nApplying this rule to our situation, we can see that if the book was written by James (according to the first statement), and the book is a mystery novel (according to the second statement), then we can infer that the book was written by James.\n\nTherefore, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
