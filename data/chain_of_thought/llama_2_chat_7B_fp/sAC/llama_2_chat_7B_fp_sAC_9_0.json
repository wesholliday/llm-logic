            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, we have two statements: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" and \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" If both of these statements are true, we can use the logical connector \"therefore\" to conclude that the first statement implies the second statement. In other words, if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n\nNow, let's apply this reasoning to the original question: \"Does it follow that 'Lisa bought the red shirt' is true?\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
