            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nIn this scenario, we have two statements: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" and \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" Both statements are true, so we can conclude that they are both logically connected.\n\nNow, we need to determine the logical connection between the two statements. The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" implies that if Joe went to the park, Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This is a logical connection, as it establishes a cause-and-effect relationship between the two statements.\n\nTherefore, if \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is true, we can conclude that \"Joe went to the park\" is also true, because if Joe went to the park, Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
