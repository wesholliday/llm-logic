If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race, which means that Alex's finishing the race implies that Chris finished the race. On the other hand, if Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race, since the statement \"Chris finished the race\" implies that Alex finished the race as well.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
