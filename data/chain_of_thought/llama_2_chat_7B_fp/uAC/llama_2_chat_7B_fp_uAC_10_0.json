Specifically, if the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside.\n\nHowever, the statement \"The cat was outside\" does not provide any information about the dog's location. It only tells us that the cat was outside.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the dog was inside based solely on the information provided. The statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" does not logically imply that the dog was inside.\n\nAnswer: No",
