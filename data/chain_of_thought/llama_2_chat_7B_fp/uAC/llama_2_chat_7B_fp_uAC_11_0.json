However, this is not always the case.\n\nIn this scenario, we are given two statements: \"The cake was chocolate\" and \"The muffins were blueberry.\" We are then asked to infer that the cake was chocolate based on the fact that the muffins were blueberry. However, this inference is not justified, as there could be other factors that explain why the muffins were blueberry.\n\nFor example, perhaps the baker deliberately made the muffins blueberry to contrast with the cake, which was actually chocolate. Or maybe the muffins were made with a different type of flour that naturally produced a blueberry color. Without additional information, we cannot logically conclude that the cake was chocolate based solely on the fact that the muffins were blueberry.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is 'no.' We cannot infer that the cake was chocolate based solely on the fact that the muffins were blueberry.",
