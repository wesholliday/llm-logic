The unicorn was in the forest.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the griffin was in the forest if the unicorn was in the forest. This is because the first statement implies that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest. Since the unicorn is in the forest, we can conclude that the griffin is also in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
