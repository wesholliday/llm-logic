            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument provided is a classic example of a logical deduction. It is based on the principle of inference, where we can infer the presence of one thing (Mary) based on the presence of another thing (Sue). In this case, we know that Mary was at the wedding if Sue was at the wedding.\n\nTo apply this principle, we need to evaluate the premises of the argument:\n\n1. Mary was at the wedding.\n2. Sue was at the wedding.\n\nFrom these premises, we can logically deduce that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding as well. This is because Sue's presence at the wedding provides evidence that Mary was also present, given their relationship.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
