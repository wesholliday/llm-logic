If James wrote the book, then it must be a mystery novel.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"The book is a mystery novel\" does not provide any information about the author of the book. It only states that the book belongs to the mystery genre.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the book was written by James solely based on the given statements. The statements do not provide any direct evidence or logical connection between the author and the book.\n\nAnswer: No",
