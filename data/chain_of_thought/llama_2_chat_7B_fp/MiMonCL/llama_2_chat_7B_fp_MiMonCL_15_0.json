The phrase \"and involve important decisions\" provides additional information that the meeting may involve important decisions, but it doesn't necessarily imply that the meeting is confidential.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the meeting is confidential based solely on the given sentence.\n\nAnswer: No",
