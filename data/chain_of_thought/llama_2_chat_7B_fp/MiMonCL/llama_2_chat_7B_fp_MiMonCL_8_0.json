The use of \"and\" suggests that both possibilities are being considered.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the vacation will definitely be expensive. However, it is possible that the vacation might be expensive, depending on the specific details of the trip.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
