The argument is:\n\nIf the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished.\nIt's not the case that the twonk must have been varnished.\nTherefore, the twonk was not plinked.\n\nThe problem with this argument is that the second premise does not necessarily follow from the first premise. Just because the twonk was not varnished does not mean it was not plinked. Therefore, we cannot infer that the twonk was not plinked based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
