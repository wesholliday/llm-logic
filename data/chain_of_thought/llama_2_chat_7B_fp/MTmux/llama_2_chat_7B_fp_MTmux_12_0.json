It's not the case that the smip must have lumped the zoint.\n3. Therefore, the smip was not shipped.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The smip was not shipped\" from the given premises, we need to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe argument is valid if and only if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion \"The smip was not shipped\" does logically follow from the premises, so the argument is valid.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The smip was not shipped\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
