To determine the validity of the argument, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe premises of the argument are:\n\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n2. If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, we need to see if the conclusion can be deduced from the premises using logical reasoning.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
