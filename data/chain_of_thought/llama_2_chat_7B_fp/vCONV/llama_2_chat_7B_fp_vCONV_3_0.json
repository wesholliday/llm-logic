To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate the truth of the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is true if the book was indeed written by James. However, the conclusion \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James\" is not necessarily true. It is possible that the book is a mystery novel even if it was not written by James. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
