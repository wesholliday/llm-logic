If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n2. If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nLet's assume that the premises are true. If the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake, according to the first premise. Now, if the mummy is awake, then the vampire is also awake, according to the second premise. Therefore, if the vampire is awake, the mummy is awake, and vice versa.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
