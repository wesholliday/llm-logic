If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n2. If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument is valid if and only if the conclusion logically follows from the premises, regardless of whether the premises are true or false.\n\nIn this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, so the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
