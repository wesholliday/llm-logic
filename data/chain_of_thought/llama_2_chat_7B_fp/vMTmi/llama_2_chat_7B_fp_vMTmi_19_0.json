Jen might not have watched basketball.\n\nThe conclusion drawn from these premises is \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nTo determine the validity of this argument, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No.\n\nThe argument is not logically valid because the second premise undermines the conclusion. If Jen might not have watched basketball, then it is possible that Tom watched football, which contradicts the conclusion. Therefore, the argument is flawed, and the conclusion cannot be logically deduced from the premises.",
