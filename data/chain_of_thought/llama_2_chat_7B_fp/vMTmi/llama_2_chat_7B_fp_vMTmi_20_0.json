However, the second premise challenges this assumption by stating that the banana might not have been yellow. This creates a logical contradiction, as the conclusion \"The apple was not red\" cannot be drawn from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid and cannot be accepted as a sound argument.\n\nAnswer: No",
