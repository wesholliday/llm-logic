Conclusion: Sue did not choose pizza\n\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we need to evaluate the conclusion based on the premises.\n\nAnswer: No, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nThe first premise states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. This means that if Sue made a particular choice, Bob is necessarily chosen the opposite option. However, the second premise states that Bob might not have chosen pasta, which means that Bob's choice is not necessarily the opposite of Sue's choice. Therefore, the conclusion that Sue did not choose pizza cannot be logically deduced from the premises.",
