However, we are also told that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the sunglasses are in the woman's bag, we need to consider the probability of each possibility. If the sunglasses are in the woman's bag, they are definitely in a location where they will not fall off her head. On the other hand, if they are perched on her head, there is a chance that they might fall off.\n\nSince the possibility of the sunglasses being in the woman's bag is more likely than them being perched on her head, we can infer that the sunglasses are likely to be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
