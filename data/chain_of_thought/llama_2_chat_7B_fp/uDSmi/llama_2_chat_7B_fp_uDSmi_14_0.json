However, the statement \"the milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" introduces a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge, which means there is a third location for the milk, which is not accounted for in the initial statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the milk is on the counter based solely on the given statements. The information provided does not allow us to make a definitive conclusion about the location of the milk.\n\nAnswer: No",
