Additionally, we are told that the watch might not be on his wrist. To determine whether we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser, we need to evaluate the information provided and consider the probability of each possibility.\n\nIf the watch is on his wrist, it is not charging. Therefore, the only possibility left is that the watch is charging on the dresser. This is because the watch might not be on his wrist, and if it is not on his wrist, it must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
