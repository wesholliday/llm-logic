The statement \"the book is either on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" implies that the book is in one of two locations: either on the shelf or on the table. However, the statement \"the book might not be resting on the table\" introduces a possibility that the book is not on the table.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the book is on the shelf with absolute certainty. The statement \"the book might not be resting on the table\" introduces a possibility that the book is not on the shelf, so we cannot conclude that it is on the shelf without further information.\n\nAnswer: No",
