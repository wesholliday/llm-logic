However, it also mentions that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch. This means that we cannot infer that the remote control is on the coffee table with absolute certainty.\n\nWe can only make an educated guess based on the information given. If we assume that the remote control is not hiding under the couch, then it must be on the coffee table. But this is not a definitive answer, as there is a possibility that the remote control might be in another location.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
