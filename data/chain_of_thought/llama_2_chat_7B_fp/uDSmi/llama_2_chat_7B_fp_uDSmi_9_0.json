However, we are also told that the missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor, which means that we cannot rule out the possibility that it is in the box.\n\nTo determine whether the missing puzzle piece is in the box or not, we need to consider the information provided in the statement. If the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor, then it is not in the box. However, if it is not blending in on the floor, then it must be in the box.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
