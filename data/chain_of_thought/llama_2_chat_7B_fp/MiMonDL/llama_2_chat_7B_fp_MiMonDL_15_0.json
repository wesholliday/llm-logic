It does not necessarily imply that the student will definitely pass the exam, but rather that there is a chance that they will.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the student might pass the exam or fail. The statement only implies that there is a possibility of passing, but does not provide any information about the likelihood of passing or failing.\n\nAnswer: No",
