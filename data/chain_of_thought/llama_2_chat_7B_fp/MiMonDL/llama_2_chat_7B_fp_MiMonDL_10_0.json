It does not necessarily imply that the computer is definitely broken or that it is working perfectly.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The computer might be broken or working\" directly from the statement \"The computer might be broken.\" The statement only suggests that there is a possibility of the computer being broken, and does not provide any information about its current state.\n\nAnswer: No",
