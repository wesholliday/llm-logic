It does not necessarily mean that the train will definitely be late, but rather that there is a chance that it might be.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The train might be late or on time\" from the given statement. The statement only implies a possibility of lateness, and does not provide any information about the train's actual arrival time.\n\nAnswer: No",
