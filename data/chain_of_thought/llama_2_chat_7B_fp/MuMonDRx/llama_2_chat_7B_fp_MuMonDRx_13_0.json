To determine whether we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to analyze the meaning of each word and how they relate to each other.\n\n'Quimble' is not a word that is commonly used in everyday language, and its meaning is not clear from the context. However, based on the word 'glorp,' which is also not a commonly used word, we can make an educated guess about the meaning of 'quimble.'\n\nGlorp is a nonsense word that is often used in wordplay and puzzles. Therefore, it's possible that 'quimble' is also a nonsense word, and 'zibble or in glorp' is a play on words.\n\nWith this in mind, we can infer that 'The quimble must be zibble or in glorp' is a humorous or nonsensical statement, and not a literal inference that can be drawn from the first sentence.\n\nAnswer: No",
