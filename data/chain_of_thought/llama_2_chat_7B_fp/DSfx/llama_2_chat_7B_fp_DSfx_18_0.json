In this case, the argument is as follows:\n\n1. The shank is not nugged.\n2. Either the shank is nugged or it is plooked.\n\nFrom these two premises, we can deduce the negation of the proposition \"The shank is plooked.\" Here's how:\n\n1. If the shank is not nugged, then it is plooked (by definition of \"plooked\").\n2. The shank is not nugged (premise 1).\n3. Therefore, the shank is plooked (by modus tollens).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
