However, this is not always the case.\n\nIn this particular argument, we are given two statements: \"The fribble is not crinkled\" and \"Either the fribble is crinkled or it is snurgled.\" From these two statements, we cannot infer that the fribble is snurgled. The reason is that the second statement provides no information about the state of the fribble's crinkling, it only provides two possible alternatives: crinkled or snurgled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that the fribble is snurgled based on the given argument. The answer is 'no.'",
