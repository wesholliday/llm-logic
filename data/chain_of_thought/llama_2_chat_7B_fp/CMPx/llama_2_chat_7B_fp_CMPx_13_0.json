    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantug, a loperit, and a frallon are shortlisted for Blither of the Year. Industry watchers consider the fantug the front runner, followed by the loperit, while the frallon is a heavy underdog. Since these are the only products in contention, if the loperit doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the fantug doesn\u2019t win, the frallon will win. Moreover, the fantug likely will win the award and hence the loperit likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantug doesn't win Blither of the Year, the frallon will?",

The argument also assumes that if the loperit doesn't win the award, then the frallon will.\n\nTo analyze this argument, we need to consider the following possibilities:\n\n1. Fantug wins the award: In this case, the loperit doesn't win, and the frallon doesn't stand a chance. Therefore, the answer is 'no'.\n2. Fantug doesn't win the award: In this case, the loperit is the next best option, and it's likely that it will win the award. However, the argument states that the frallon will win if the fantug doesn't win. This means that the frallon has a better chance of winning than the loperit. Therefore, the answer is 'yes'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
