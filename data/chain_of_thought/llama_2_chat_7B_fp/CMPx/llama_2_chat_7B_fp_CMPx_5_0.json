    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fraglen, a darpil, and a votal are the top bispil teams this season. The fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, while the votal trails far behind. These lead the league, so if the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn\u2019t, the votal will. Moreover, the fraglen likely will lead the league and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fraglen doesn\u2019t lead the league, the votal will?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given argument is based on the assumption that the fraglen, darpil, and votal are the top bispil teams this season, and that the fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, while the votal trails far behind. The argument also assumes that if the darpil doesn't have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn't, the votal will.\n\nTo determine whether it's likely that if the fraglen doesn't lead the league, the votal will, we need to analyze the given argument step by step:\n\n1. If the darpil doesn't have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn't, the votal will.\n2. The fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, while the votal trails far behind.\n3. Therefore, if the fraglen doesn't lead the league, the darpil will.\n4. Since the darpil is expected to have the second-best record, if it leads the league, the votal will not.\n5. Therefore, it's likely that if the fraglen doesn't lead the league, the votal will.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
