    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trundle, a foopet, and a crangor are likely to be the top selling whippits. The trundle will likely be #1 in sales, followed closely by the foopet, with the crangor having significantly lower expected sales. These lead whippit sales, so if the foopet isn\u2019t the top seller, then if the trundle isn\u2019t, the crangor will be. Moreover, the trundle likely will lead sales and hence the foopet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trundle isn\u2019t the top selling whippit, the crangor will be?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given argument is based on the idea that if the trundle is not the top selling whippit, then the foopet will be. However, the argument also states that the trundle is likely to lead sales, which means that if the trundle is not the top selling whippit, then the foopet will not be either. This creates a contradiction, as the argument initially states that the foopet will be the top seller if the trundle is not, but then later states that the trundle will lead sales, which means the foopet will not be the top seller.\n\nTherefore, the argument does not follow, and it is not likely that if the trundle is not the top selling whippit, the crangor will be. The answer is 'no'.",
