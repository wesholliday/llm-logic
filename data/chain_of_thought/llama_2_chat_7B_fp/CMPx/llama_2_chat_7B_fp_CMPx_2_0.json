The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

Since there are only three applicants, if the cramen doesn't get the position, then the jantiz will, and if the jantiz doesn't get it, the sulect will. This creates a chain of probability where the jantiz not getting the position leads to the cramen not getting it, and the sulect getting it.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
