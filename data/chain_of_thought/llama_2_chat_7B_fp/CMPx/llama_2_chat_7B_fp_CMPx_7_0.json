    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crastin, a nivet, and a jomial are the top bispets this breeding season. Breeders expect the crastin likely will birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. These lead in birthing, so if the nivet doesn\u2019t birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn\u2019t, the jomial will. Moreover, the crastin likely will lead births and hence the nivet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, the jomial will?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given argument is based on the assumption that the crastin, nivet, and jomial are the top bispets this breeding season, and that the crastin is likely to birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. The argument also assumes that the lead in birthing, if the nivet doesn't birth the most offspring, then the crastin won't, and vice versa.\n\nTo determine whether it follows that if the crastin doesn't lead births, the jomial will, we need to analyze the logical implications of the given argument.\n\nIf the crastin doesn't lead births, it means that the nivet will lead births instead. Since the nivet is expected to birth fewer offspring than the crastin, it means that the jomial will birth the most offspring. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
