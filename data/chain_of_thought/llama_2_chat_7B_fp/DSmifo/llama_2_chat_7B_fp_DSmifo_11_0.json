This means that the newspaper could be somewhere else, such as in the driveway.\n\nFrom the second premise, \"Either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway,\" we can infer that the newspaper is either on the porch or in the driveway. Since we have already inferred that the newspaper might not be on the porch, the only possible location left is the driveway.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
