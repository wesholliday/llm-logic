            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument provided is a classic example of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a type of argument that involves two exclusive possibilities. In this case, the argument states that either the remote control is hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table, we need to evaluate the two possibilities presented in the argument. If the remote control is hiding under the couch, then it is not on the coffee table, so the only possibility left is that it is on the coffee table. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
