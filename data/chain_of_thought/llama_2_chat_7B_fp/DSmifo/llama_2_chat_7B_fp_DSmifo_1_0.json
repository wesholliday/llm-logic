In this case, the argument states that either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'Fido is inside' from the given argument, we need to evaluate the two possibilities presented in the argument. If Fido is in the garden, then it cannot be inside, and if Fido is inside, then it cannot be in the garden. Therefore, the only possible conclusion we can draw from the argument is 'Fido is inside'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
