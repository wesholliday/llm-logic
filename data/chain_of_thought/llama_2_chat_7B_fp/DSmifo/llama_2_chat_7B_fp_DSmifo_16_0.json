            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The pen is in my bag\" from the given premises, we need to apply the rule of inference known as modus tollens. This rule states that if we have two premises, P and \u00acQ, and we know that if P is true, then Q is false, then we can infer that Q is true.\n\nIn this case, the premises are:\n\n1. The pen might not be on my desk (P)\n2. Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag (\u00acQ)\n\nWe know that if the pen is not on my desk, then it must be in my bag. Therefore, if the pen might not be on my desk, we can infer that it is in my bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
