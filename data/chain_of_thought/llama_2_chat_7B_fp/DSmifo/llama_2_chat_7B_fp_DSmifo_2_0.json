This means that the book could be somewhere else, such as on the shelf.\n\nFrom the second premise, \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf,\" we can infer that the book is either on the table or on the shelf. Since the book is not resting on the table, it must be on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
