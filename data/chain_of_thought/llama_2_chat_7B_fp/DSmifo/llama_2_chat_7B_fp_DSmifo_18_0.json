            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The notebook is in the drawer\" from the given premises, we need to apply the rule of inference known as modus tollens. This rule states that if it is not the case that A is true, and it is not the case that B is true, then it is not the case that C is true.\n\nIn this case, the premises are:\n\n1. The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\n2. Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand. If the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand, then it must be in the drawer. Therefore, we can conclude that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
