The statement mentions that the notebook must be in the drawer, which implies that the notebook is in a specific location. However, it does not explicitly state that the notebook is in the drawer, which means that it could be in another location.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the notebook must be in the drawer. It is possible that the notebook is in another location, such as on a desk or in a different room.\n\nAnswer: No",
