The question states that Alex did not finish the race, which implies that Alex did not cross the finish line. However, it does not explicitly state that Alex did not start the race or that Alex did not participate in the race at all.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Alex must have finished the race. However, we can infer that Alex might not have finished the race based on the information provided. This is because the question only provides information about Alex not finishing the race, and does not provide any information about Alex starting or participating in the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
