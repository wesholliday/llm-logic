The statement says \"it's not the case that the milk must be on the counter.\" This means that the milk is not necessarily on the counter, but it also does not necessarily mean that it is not on the counter.\n\nTherefore, we cannot make an inference that the milk might not be on the counter based solely on the information provided in the statement. The statement only rules out the possibility that the milk must be on the counter, but it does not provide any information about whether the milk might be on the counter or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
