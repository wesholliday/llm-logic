The statement mentions that the sunglasses are not in her bag, which implies that the sunglasses are not present in the bag. However, the statement does not explicitly state that the sunglasses are not in the bag, only that they are not in her bag.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that the sunglasses are not in the bag. However, we can infer that the sunglasses might not be in the bag based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
