The statement tells us that the watch is not charging, but it does not mention the location of the watch. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nHowever, we can also consider other possible locations where the watch might be charging, such as a charging station or a different dresser. Therefore, we cannot infer that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
