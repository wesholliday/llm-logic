The question states that Lisa must have bought the red shirt, which implies that the statement \"Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" is a given. However, we are asked if we can infer that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt, which suggests that there may be additional information that contradicts the given statement.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the possibility that the statement \"Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" may not be true. If we can find any evidence that contradicts this statement, then we can infer that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
