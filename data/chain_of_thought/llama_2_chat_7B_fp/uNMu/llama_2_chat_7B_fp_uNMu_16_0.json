The statement is \"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag.\" This means that the pen is not necessarily in the bag, but it is not necessarily not in the bag either.\n\nIn other words, the statement only rules out the possibility that the pen must be in the bag, but it does not provide any information about the likelihood of the pen being in the bag. Therefore, we cannot infer that the pen might not be in the bag based solely on this statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
