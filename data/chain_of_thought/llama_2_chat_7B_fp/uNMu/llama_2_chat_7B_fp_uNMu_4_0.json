The question states that the alien must have visited Earth, which means that the alien did visit at least one planet in our solar system. However, it does not explicitly state that the alien visited Mars.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the alien might not have visited Mars, as there is no direct evidence to suggest that the alien did visit Mars. It is possible that the alien visited other planets in our solar system, such as Jupiter or Saturn, but we cannot assume that the alien visited Mars without additional information.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
