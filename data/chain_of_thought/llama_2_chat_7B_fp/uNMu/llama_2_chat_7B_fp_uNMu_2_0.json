The question states that the griffin must not have been in the forest, which implies that the griffin's location is not in the forest. However, it does not provide any information about the griffin's actual location.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the griffin must have been in the forest. Instead, we can only conclude that the griffin's location is not in the forest, without knowing its actual location.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
