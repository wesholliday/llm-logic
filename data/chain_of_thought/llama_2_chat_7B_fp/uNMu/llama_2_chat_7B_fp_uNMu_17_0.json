The statement mentions that the scarf must be stuffed in your backpack, which implies that the scarf is not already in the backpack. However, it does not explicitly state that the scarf is not in the backpack. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the scarf might not be stuffed in your backpack with absolute certainty.\n\nAnswer: No",
