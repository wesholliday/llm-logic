This rule states that if a conclusion can be drawn from a set of premises, and one of the premises is a universal statement, then the conclusion can be inferred.\n\nIn this case, the universal statement is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" If we combine this statement with the particular statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" we can infer that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
