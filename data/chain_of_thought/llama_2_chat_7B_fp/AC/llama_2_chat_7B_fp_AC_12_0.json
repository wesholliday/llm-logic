Specifically, we are using the principle of non-contradiction, which states that a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time.\n\nLet's analyze the given premises:\n\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n2. Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nFrom these premises, we can deduce that Joe went to the park. Why? Because if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo, and Lucy actually went to the zoo. Therefore, Joe must have gone to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
