            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nIn order to determine whether we can infer \"The car was red\" from the given premises, we need to carefully analyze the logical relationship between the statements.\n\nFrom the first statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue,\" we can infer that if the car was red, then the truck must be blue. This is a logical consequence of the statement, as the word \"if\" implies a causal relationship between the two clauses.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"The truck was blue.\" This statement provides us with new information that the truck is indeed blue.\n\nBased on the first statement and the new information provided by the second statement, we can ask ourselves: if the car was red, then what must be true about the truck? Since the truck is blue, we can conclude that if the car was red, then the truck must be blue.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The car was red\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
