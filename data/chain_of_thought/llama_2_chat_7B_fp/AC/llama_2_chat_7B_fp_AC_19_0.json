            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nIn order to infer that Tom watched football based on the given premises, we need to use the logical rule of inference known as modus ponens. Modus ponens is a basic rule of reasoning that allows us to draw a conclusion from two premises, if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nIn this case, the premises are \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" and \"Jen watched basketball\". Using modus ponens, we can conclude that if Jen watched basketball, then Tom must have watched football.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'Tom watched football'?\" is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
