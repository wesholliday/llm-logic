            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nFrom the given premises, we can infer that the sunglasses are not perched on the woman's head. This is because the statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" implies that the sunglasses are not in that position.\n\nNow, we are given another premise \"Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag\". This premise tells us that the sunglasses must be in one of the two locations mentioned - either on the woman's head or in her bag.\n\nSince we have already established that the sunglasses are not perched on the woman's head, the only possible location left is in her bag. Therefore, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
