This is because the statement \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack\" implies that the scarf is not in that location.\n\nNow, we have two options: either the scarf is draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in your backpack. Since we know that the scarf is not draped on the coat rack, the only remaining option is that it is stuffed in your backpack. Therefore, the conclusion that can be drawn is \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
