In this case, the argument states that either the cat is playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch, we need to evaluate the two possibilities presented in the argument. If the cat is playing in the bedroom, then it cannot be napping on the couch, as these are mutually exclusive activities. On the other hand, if the cat is not playing in the bedroom, then it could be napping on the couch.\n\nTherefore, based on the argument provided, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
