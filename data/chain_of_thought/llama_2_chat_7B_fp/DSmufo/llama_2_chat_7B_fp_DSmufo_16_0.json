From the first premise, \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk,\" we can conclude that the pen is not on the desk. From the second premise, \"Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag,\" we can deduce that if the pen is not on the desk, then it must be in the bag.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the situation: if the pen is not on the desk, then it must be in the bag. Since the pen is not on the desk, we can conclude that the pen is in the bag. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
