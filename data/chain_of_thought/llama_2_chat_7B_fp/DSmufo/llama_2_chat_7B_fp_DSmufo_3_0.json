This is because the statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" implies that the keys are not in that position.\n\nNow, we have two options: either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer. Since we know that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, the only remaining option is that they are in the drawer. Therefore, the conclusion we can draw is that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
