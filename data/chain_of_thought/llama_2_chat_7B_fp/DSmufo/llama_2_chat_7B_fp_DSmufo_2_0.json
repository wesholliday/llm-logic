This means that the book is either not on the table or is not resting on the table.\n\nFrom the second premise, \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf,\" we can conclude that the book is either on the table or on the shelf. Since we have already determined that the book is not resting on the table, the only possible conclusion is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
