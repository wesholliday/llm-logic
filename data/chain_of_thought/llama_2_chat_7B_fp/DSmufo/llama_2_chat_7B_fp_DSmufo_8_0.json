In this case, the argument states that either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table, we need to evaluate the two possibilities presented in the argument. If the remote control must be hiding under the couch, then it cannot be on the coffee table, as these two locations are mutually exclusive. On the other hand, if the remote control is on the coffee table, then it is not hiding under the couch.\n\nTherefore, based on the argument provided, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
