We are given two premises: \"It's not the case that the shank must have been nugged\" and \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged.\" From these premises, we can deduce a conclusion: \"The shank was not plooked.\"\n\nTo see why, let's break down the argument:\n\n1. If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged (premise)\n2. It's not the case that the shank must have been nugged (premise)\n3.
