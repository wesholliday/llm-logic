The premises are:\n\n1. It's not the case that the glip must have tragged.\n2. If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged.\n\nTo infer the conclusion, we need to consider the two premises and determine which conclusion follows from them.\n\nIf we assume that the glip was not slogged (i.e., the first premise is true), then we can conclude that the glip did not tragged (i.e., the second premise is false).
