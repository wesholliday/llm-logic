We are given two premises: \"It's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed\" and \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed.\" From these premises, we can deduce the conclusion \"The flug was not blummed.\"\n\nTo see why, let's break down the argument:\n\n1. If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed (premise)\n2. It's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed (premise)\n3. Therefore, the flug was not blummed (deduced conclusion)\n\nNow, let's answer the question:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
