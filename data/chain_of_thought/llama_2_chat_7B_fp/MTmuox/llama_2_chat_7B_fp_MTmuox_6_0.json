If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink (premise)\n2. It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink (premise)\n3. Therefore, the grommet was not sploffed (conclusion)\n\nNow, let's analyze each premise:\n\n1. If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink: This premise assumes that if the grommet is in a certain state (being sploffed), then it must perform a specific action (plopping the frink).\n2. It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink: This premise is the negation of the first premise, indicating that the grommet did not perform the action of plopping the frink, even if it was sploffed.\n\nNow, based on these premises, we can infer the conclusion:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
