In this case, the positive premise is \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint,\" and the negative premise is \"It's not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint.\"\n\nTo apply modus tollens, we can start with the positive premise and deduce the negation of the conclusion. In this case, the negation of the conclusion is \"The smip was not shripped.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'The smip was not shripped' from the given statements?\" is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
