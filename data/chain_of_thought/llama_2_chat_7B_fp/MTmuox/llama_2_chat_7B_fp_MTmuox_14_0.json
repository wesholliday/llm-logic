This is because if it were snugged, then it must have been snugged, which is not the case.\n\nFrom the second premise, \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged,\" we can infer that the clug was not fleeked. This is because if it were fleeked, then it must have been snugged, which is not the case.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can conclude that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
