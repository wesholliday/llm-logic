It's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled (premise)\n3. Therefore, the flugel was not blimmed (conclusion)\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'The flugel was not blimmed' from the given premises, we need to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe argument is valid, as the conclusion logically follows from the premises. If the flugel was blimmed, then it must have been zargled, and since it's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled, we can conclude that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
