            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The project must have been under budget\" from the statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday and under budget,\" we need to analyze the information provided in the statement.\n\nThe statement tells us that the project must have been completed by Friday, which means that the project duration must have been less than or equal to 5 days (Friday inclusive).\n\nAdditionally, the statement also tells us that the project must have been under budget, which means that the actual cost of the project is less than or equal to the budgeted cost.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible values of the project duration and budget:\n\n* If the project duration is 1 day, then the budget must have been less than or equal to $100,000 (since the project must have been completed by Friday).\n* If the project duration is 2 days, then the budget must have been less than or equal to $200,000 (since the project must have been completed by Friday).\n* If the project duration is 3 days, then the budget must have been less than or equal to $300,000 (since the project must have been completed by Friday).\n* If the project duration is 4 days, then the budget must have been less than or equal to $400,000 (since the project must have been completed by Friday).\n* If the project duration is 5 days, then the budget must have been less than or equal to $500,000 (since the project must have been completed by Friday).\n\nBased on the information provided in the statement, we can conclude that the project must have been under budget, since the project duration is less than or equal to 5 days and the budget is less than or equal to $500,000.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
