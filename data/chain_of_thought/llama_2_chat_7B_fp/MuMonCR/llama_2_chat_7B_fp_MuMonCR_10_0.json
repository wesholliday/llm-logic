The statement mentions that the document must have been signed and notarized. Since the document must have been signed, it means that someone has put their signature on it. However, the statement does not explicitly mention that the signature must have been notarized. Therefore, we cannot infer that the document must have been notarized based solely on the information provided in the statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
