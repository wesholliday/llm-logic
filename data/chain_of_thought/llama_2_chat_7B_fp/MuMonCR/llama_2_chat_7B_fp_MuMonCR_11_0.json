The statement mentions that the software must have been updated and restarted. Since the software must have been updated, it means that there was a new version of the software available, and the system was updated with the new version. However, the statement does not explicitly mention that the software was restarted after the update.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the software must have been restarted solely based on the information provided in the statement. It is possible that the software was updated but not restarted, or that the software was restarted but not updated.\n\nAnswer: No",
