This implies that the medicine was taken at least twice a day, but it does not necessarily mean that it was taken twice daily.\n\nFor example, if the medicine was taken with food in the morning and evening, it would have been taken twice daily, but the statement does not explicitly state that it was taken at those specific times.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
