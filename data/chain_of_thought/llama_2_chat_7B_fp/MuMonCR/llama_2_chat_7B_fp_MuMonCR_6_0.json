However, it does not explicitly state that the concert started at 8 PM. It only implies that the concert started at that time.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the concert started at 8 PM with absolute certainty. It is possible that the concert started at a different time, or that the statement is incorrect and the concert did not sell out.\n\nAnswer: No",
