The statement mentions that the restaurant was closed on Mondays, which implies that the restaurant was open on other days of the week. Since the statement does not provide any information about the type of cuisine served on other days, we cannot infer that the restaurant served Italian cuisine based solely on the fact that it was closed on Mondays.\n\nHowever, if we are given additional information that the restaurant served Italian cuisine on other days of the week, then we can infer that the restaurant served Italian cuisine. For example, if the statement mentioned that the restaurant served Italian cuisine on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, then we can infer that the restaurant served Italian cuisine.\n\nAnswer: No",
