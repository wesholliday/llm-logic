However, it does not explicitly state that the person who signed for it was the intended recipient. It's possible that the package was delivered to a neighbor or a delivery person, and they signed for it on behalf of the intended recipient.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the package must have been signed for by the intended recipient without additional information.\n\nAnswer: No",
