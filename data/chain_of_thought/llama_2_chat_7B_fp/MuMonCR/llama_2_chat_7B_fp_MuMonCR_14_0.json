However, it does not necessarily imply that the contract was actually renewed or extended.\n\nTo infer that the contract was renewable, we would need additional information or context that suggests the contract was indeed renewed or extended. For example, if the statement \"The contract was renewed for an additional year\" is provided, then we can infer that the contract was both valid for a year and renewable.\n\nAnswer: No",
