Either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged.\n2. It's not the case that the glip must be tragged.\n\nFrom these two premises, we can infer the conclusion that the glip is slogged. Here's how:\n\n* If the glip is slogged, then it is not tragged (premise 1).\n* If it is not tragged, then it must be slogged (premise 2).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
