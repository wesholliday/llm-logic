In this case, the argument states that either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled, and it's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled.\n\nTo infer the conclusion that the sprocket is cranked, we need to consider the two possibilities presented in the argument:\n\n1. The sprocket is cranked: This possibility is presented as the other option in the argument, and it is not negated. Therefore, if the argument is valid, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked.\n2. The sprocket must be daggled: This possibility is negated in the argument, which means that it cannot be the case. Therefore, if the argument is valid, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
