The premises are:\n\n1. Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged.\n2. It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer two possible conclusions:\n\n1. The smonk is vreebled.\n2. The smonk must be plagged.\n\nNow, to answer your question, I will write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' depending on whether the conclusion 'The smonk is vreebled' is true or false.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
