The argument states that it's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled, which means that if it's not smoogled, it must be fraggled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\n* If the zinger is not smoogled, it must be fraggled (premise)\n* It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled (premise)\n* Therefore, the zinger is fraggled (conclusion)\n\nAnswer: Yes",
