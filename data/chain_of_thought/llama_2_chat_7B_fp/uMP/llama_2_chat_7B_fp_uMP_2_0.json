The griffin was in the forest.\n\nTo infer whether the unicorn was in the forest or not, we need to use the logical connective \"if-then\" in the first statement. The if-then statement means that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest.\n\nSo, if the griffin was in the forest, we can conclude that the unicorn was also in the forest.
