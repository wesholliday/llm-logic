We know that Sue chose pizza, and we are told that Bob chose pasta. This means that Sue and Bob have different food choices. Since Sue chose pizza, it is possible that Bob chose a different food, such as pasta. Therefore, we cannot infer that Bob chose pasta based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
