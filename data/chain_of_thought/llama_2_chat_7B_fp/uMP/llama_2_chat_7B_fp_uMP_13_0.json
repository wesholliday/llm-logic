The statement \"the car was red\" tells us that the car has the property of being red, and the statement \"if the car was red, then the truck was blue\" implies a logical connection between the car's redness and the truck's color.\n\nIf the car is red, then the truck must also have a different color, which is blue. Therefore, based on the information given, we can infer that the truck was blue.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
