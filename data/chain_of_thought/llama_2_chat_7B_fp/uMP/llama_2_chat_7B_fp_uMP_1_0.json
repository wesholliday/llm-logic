            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument provided is a classic example of a logical deduction. It is based on the principle of inference, where we can infer the presence of one thing (Sue) based on the presence of another thing (Mary).\n\nThe argument states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This is because Mary and Sue are connected in some way, and the presence of Mary at the wedding implies that Sue was also present.\n\nTo apply this principle of inference, we need to evaluate the premises of the argument and determine if they are true. In this case, the premises are:\n\n1. Mary was at the wedding.\n2. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n\nIf both premises are true, then we can logically deduce that Sue was at the wedding. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
