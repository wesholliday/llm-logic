In this case, the alternatives are \"the flob must be moved\" and \"the flob is skizzled.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The flob is skizzled\" from the given premises, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nIf the first premise \"The flob might not be moved\" is true, then the second premise \"Either the flob must be moved or it is skizzled\" becomes \"The flob must be skizzled.\" Therefore, if the first premise is true, we can infer that the conclusion \"The flob is skizzled\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
