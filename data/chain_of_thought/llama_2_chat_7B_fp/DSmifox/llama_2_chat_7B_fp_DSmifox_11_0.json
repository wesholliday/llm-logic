The first statement suggests that the flug might not be zimmed, which means that it could be blummed. The second statement states that either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed, which implies that if the flug is not zimmed, it must be blummed. Therefore, we can conclude that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
