Either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the fribble is snurgled. Here's how:\n\n1. If the fribble might not be crinked, then it must be snurgled. This is because the statement \"The fribble might not be crinked\" implies that the fribble is not crinked, and the second statement \"Either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled\" implies that if the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled.\n2. Therefore, the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
