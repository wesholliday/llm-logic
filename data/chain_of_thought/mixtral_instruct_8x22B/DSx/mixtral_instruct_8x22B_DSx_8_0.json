            "content": " Explanation: This is a basic problem of logical deduction using the law of excluded middle and modus ponens. The law of excluded middle states that a statement is either true or its negation is true. In this case, the statement is 'The sprocket is cranked' or 'The sprocket is daggled'. The statement 'The sprocket is not daggled' is the negation of 'The sprocket is daggled'. Therefore, if 'The sprocket is not daggled' is true, then 'The sprocket is cranked' must be true, according to the law of excluded middle. This is also an example of modus ponens, a rule of inference that allows us to infer the truth of a statement from the truth of another statement. In this case, if 'Either the sprocket is cranked or it is daggled' is true, and 'The sprocket is not daggled' is true, then 'The sprocket is cranked' must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
