            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of a logical operation called disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid argument form. The statement \"Either the sneg is crampled or it is sproted\" is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions (crampled or sproted) must be true. When we are given the additional statement \"The sneg is not sproted\", we can infer that the remaining condition in the disjunction must be true. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The sneg is crampled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
