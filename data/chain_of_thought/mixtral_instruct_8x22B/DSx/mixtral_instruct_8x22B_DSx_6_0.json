            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of a logical operation known as disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid argument form. The statement \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it is plopped\" is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions (sploffed or plopped) must be true. The second statement \"The grommet is not plopped\" is a negation, which means that the condition of being plopped is false. Since the disjunction states that at least one condition must be true, and we know that the condition of being plopped is false, we can infer that the other condition (being sploffed) must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
