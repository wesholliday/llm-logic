            "content": " Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical operation known as disjunctive syllogism. The statement \"Either the shank is plooked or it is nugged\" is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions (plooked or nugged) must be true. The statement \"The shank is not nugged\" is a negation, which means that the condition of being nugged is false. According to the rules of disjunctive syllogism, if one of the conditions in a disjunction is false, then the other condition must be true. Therefore, if the shank is not nugged, then it must be plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
