            "content": " Explanation: This is a classic example of logical reasoning using disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid argument form. The statement 'Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked' is a disjunction, meaning that it presents two possibilities: the splat is morphed or the splat is quanked. The statement 'The splat is not quanked' is a negation, which denies one of the possibilities presented in the disjunction. According to the rules of disjunctive syllogism, if one possibility in a disjunction is denied, then the other possibility must be true. Therefore, if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
