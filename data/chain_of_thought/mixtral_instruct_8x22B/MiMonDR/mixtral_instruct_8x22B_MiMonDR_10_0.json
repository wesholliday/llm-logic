            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The computer might be broken' implies that there is a possibility that the computer is not functioning properly. However, it does not exclude the possibility that the computer might also be working. In logic, this is known as the principle of excluded middle, which states that every proposition is either true or false. Therefore, if we are unsure whether the computer is broken or not, we can infer that it might be either working or broken.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
