            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"The team might win the game\" implies that there is a possibility that the team could win the game, but it does not provide any information about the possibility of the team losing the game. However, in any game, there are typically only two outcomes: winning or losing. Therefore, if there is a possibility that the team could win, there must also be a possibility that the team could lose. This is because the two outcomes are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive, meaning that if one outcome does not occur, the other must occur.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
