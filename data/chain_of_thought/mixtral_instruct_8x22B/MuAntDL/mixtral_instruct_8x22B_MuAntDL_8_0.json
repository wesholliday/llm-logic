However, we cannot definitively infer that \"The restaurant must have been closed on Monday\" because the restaurant could also have been open for limited hours on Monday. Without additional information, we cannot eliminate the possibility of the restaurant being open for limited hours on Monday.\n\nAnswer: No.",
