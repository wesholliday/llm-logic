            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been signed or notarized\" implies that there are two possible ways for the document to meet the requirement: either it must have been signed, or it must have been notarized. This means that the document could have been signed, notarized, or both. Therefore, it is possible that the document was signed, but it is not necessarily true, as the document could have been notarized without being signed. However, the statement does not exclude the possibility that the document was signed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
