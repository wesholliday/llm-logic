            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday or extended\" implies that there are two possible outcomes for the project: either it is completed by Friday, or it is extended beyond Friday. This means that the project does not necessarily have to be completed by Friday, as there is an alternative option of extending the project. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The project must have been completed by Friday\" based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
