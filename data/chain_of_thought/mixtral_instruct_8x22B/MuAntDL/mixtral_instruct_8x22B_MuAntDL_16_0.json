            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"The room must have been cleaned daily or upon request\" implies that there are two conditions under which the room must be cleaned: either daily or upon request. This means that the room could be cleaned daily, but it could also be cleaned upon request, which might not necessarily be daily.
