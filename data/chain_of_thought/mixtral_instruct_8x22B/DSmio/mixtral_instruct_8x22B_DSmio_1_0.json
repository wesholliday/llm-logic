            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'Fido might not be in the garden' implies that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. The second statement 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. If Fido is not in the garden, then the only remaining possibility from the disjunction is that Fido is inside. Therefore, if we accept the premise that Fido might not be in the garden, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
