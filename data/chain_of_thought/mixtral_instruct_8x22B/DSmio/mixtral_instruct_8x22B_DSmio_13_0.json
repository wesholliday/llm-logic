            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf' suggests that the toy could be anywhere else, not necessarily in the toy box. However, the second statement 'Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf' is a disjunction that limits the possible locations of the toy to two places: the toy box or the bookshelf. Since we know from the first statement that the toy might not be on the bookshelf, the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box. This is a valid inference based on the logical principle of disjunctive syllogism, which states that if we know that one of two statements is true and we also know that one of them is false, then the other must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
