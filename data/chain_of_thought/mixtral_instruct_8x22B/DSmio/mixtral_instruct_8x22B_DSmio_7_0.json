Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that there is a possibility that the umbrella is not in the closet. However, this does not confirm the location of the umbrella.\n\nThe second statement provides us with two possibilities for the location of the umbrella: either it is in the car or it is tucked away in the closet. Since we know from the first statement that the umbrella might not be in the closet, we can infer that the other possibility is true, i.e., the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
