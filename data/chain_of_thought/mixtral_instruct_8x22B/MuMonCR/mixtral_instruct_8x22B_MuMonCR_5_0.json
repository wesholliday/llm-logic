            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for\" implies two conditions: 1) the package was delivered today, and 2) the package was signed for upon delivery. Since both conditions are linked by the conjunction \"and,\" it means that both must be true for the statement to be true. Therefore, if the package must have been delivered today and signed for, it logically follows that the package must have been signed for.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
