            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"The exam must have been difficult and covered all chapters\" implies two conditions: the exam was difficult and the exam covered all chapters. Since the statement is a conjunction of these two conditions, it means both must be true. Therefore, if the original statement is true, it must be true that \"The exam must have covered all chapters\". This is a valid inference because it is simply isolating one of the conditions from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
