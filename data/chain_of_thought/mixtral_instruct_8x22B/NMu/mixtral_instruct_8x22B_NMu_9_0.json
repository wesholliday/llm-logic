            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt' is a negation of a necessity statement. In modal logic, the negation of necessity (must) is possibility (might). Therefore, if it's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt, then it's possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This can also be interpreted as 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
