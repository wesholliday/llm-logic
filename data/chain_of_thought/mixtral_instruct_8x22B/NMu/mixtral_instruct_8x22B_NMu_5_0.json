            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball' is a negation of a necessity statement. In modal logic, the negation of necessity (must) is possibility (might). Therefore, if it's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball, then it's possible that Jeff did not play basketball.
