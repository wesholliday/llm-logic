            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box' is a negation of a necessity statement. The original statement, 'The toy must be in the toy box', asserts that the toy being in the toy box is a certainty or a requirement. By negating this statement, we are saying that it is not necessarily true that the toy is in the toy box. This leaves open the possibility that the toy might not be in the toy box. Therefore, from the given statement, we can infer that 'The toy might not be in the toy box'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
