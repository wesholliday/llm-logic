            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars' is a negation of a necessity statement. In modal logic, the negation of necessity (must) is possibility (might). Therefore, if it's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars, then it's possible that the alien might not have visited Mars. This is because the negation of a necessity statement does not imply impossibility, but rather the possibility of the opposite.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
