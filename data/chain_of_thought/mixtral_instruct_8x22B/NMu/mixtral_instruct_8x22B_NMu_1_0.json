            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding' is a negation of a necessity statement. The original statement, 'Mary must have been at the wedding', is a statement of necessity, meaning that it is necessary for Mary to have been at the wedding. When we negate this statement, we are saying that it is not necessary for Mary to have been at the wedding. This does not mean that Mary was not at the wedding, but rather that her presence was not required or guaranteed. Therefore, we can infer that 'Mary might not have been at the wedding', because her presence was not necessary.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
