            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The quorple must be at snork gribble and it must be in the wibble plonk' is a conjunction of two separate conditions that the quorple must meet. The word 'and' is used to connect these two conditions, indicating that both must be true simultaneously. Therefore, the inference 'The quorple must be at snork gribble and in the wibble plonk' is a correct restatement of the original statement, as it maintains the same meaning and logical structure.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
