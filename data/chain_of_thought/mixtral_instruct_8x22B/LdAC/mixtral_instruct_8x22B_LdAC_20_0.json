            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement, also known as a sufficient condition. This means that if the condition (the apple was red) is true, then the consequence (the banana was yellow) must also be true. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the consequence is true, then the condition is also true. In other words, just because the banana was yellow, we cannot logically deduce that the apple was red. The banana could have been yellow for a different reason.\n\nAnswer: No.",
