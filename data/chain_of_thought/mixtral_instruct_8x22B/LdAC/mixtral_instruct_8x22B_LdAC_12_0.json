The given information is that Lucy went to the zoo, which is the conclusion of the conditional statement. However, the fact that the conclusion is true does not necessarily mean that the hypothesis is also true. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce that Joe went to the park based solely on the information that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: No.",
