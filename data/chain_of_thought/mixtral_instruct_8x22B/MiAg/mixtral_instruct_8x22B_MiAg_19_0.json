            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The athlete might be wearing a red jersey and the athlete might be stretching' is a conjunction of two independent possibilities. The first possibility is that the athlete might be wearing a red jersey, and the second possibility is that the athlete might be stretching. However, the statement does not provide any information about whether these two possibilities occur simultaneously or independently.
