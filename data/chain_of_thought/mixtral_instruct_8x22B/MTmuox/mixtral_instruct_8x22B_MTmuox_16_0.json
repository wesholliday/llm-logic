            "content": " Explanation: The first statement \"It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink\" can be interpreted as \"The sneg is not necessarily the one who sproted the frink\". The second statement \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink\" is a conditional statement, which means that if the sneg was crampled, then it is a certainty that the sneg sproted the frink. However, since we know from the first statement that the sneg is not necessarily the one who sproted the frink, we can infer that the condition for the sneg being crampled was not met. Therefore, we can infer that \"The sneg was not crampled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
