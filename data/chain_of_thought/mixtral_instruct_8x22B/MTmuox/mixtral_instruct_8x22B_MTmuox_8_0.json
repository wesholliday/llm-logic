            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled' can be interpreted as 'The sprocket might not have been daggled'. The second statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled' is a conditional statement. If we combine these two statements, we can infer that if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled. However, we know that it's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled. Therefore, the only way for both statements to be true is if the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
