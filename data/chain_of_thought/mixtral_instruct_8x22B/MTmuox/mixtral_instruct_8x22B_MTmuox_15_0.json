            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that the dreb must have been spened' implies that the dreb might not have been spened. The second statement 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened' is a conditional statement that tells us that vroombing the dreb would necessarily result in the dreb being spened. However, since we know that the dreb might not have been spened, it follows that the dreb might not have been vroombed either. This is because if the dreb had been vroombed, it would have to have been spened, which we know is not necessarily the case. Therefore, we can infer that 'The dreb was not vroombed'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
