            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that the splat must have quanked' can be interpreted as 'The splat might not have quanked'. The second statement 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked' is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the splat was morphed) is true, then the consequent (the splat must have quanked) must also be true. However, if the consequent is false (the splat might not have quanked), then the antecedent must also be false (the splat was not morphed). Therefore, we can infer that 'The splat was not morphed'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
