The second statement 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned' is a conditional statement that tells us if the fleeg was bluttered, then it definitely was surned. However, since we know that it is possible that the fleeg was not surned, we can infer that the condition for the fleeg being bluttered was not met. Therefore, we can infer that 'The fleeg was not bluttered'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
