            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that the wug must have been garpled' can be interpreted as 'The wug might not have been garpled'. This means that the wug being garpled is not a certainty. The second statement 'If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled' is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the wug was sproinged) is true, then the consequence (the wug must have been garpled) is also true. However, if the consequence is false (the wug might not have been garpled), then the condition must also be false (the wug was not sproinged). This is based on the logical principle of contrapositive, which states that if a conditional statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
