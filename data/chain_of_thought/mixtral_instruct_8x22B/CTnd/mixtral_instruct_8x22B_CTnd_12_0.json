            "content": " Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"Jane studied\" and Q is \"she did not study long\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If she studied long, then she did not study\", which is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the contrapositive is not logically equivalent to the inverse of the original statement, which is \"If Jane did not study long, then she studied\". Therefore, we cannot directly infer the statement \"If Jane studied long, then she did not study\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
