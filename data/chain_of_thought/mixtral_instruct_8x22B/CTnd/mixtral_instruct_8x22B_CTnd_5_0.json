            "content": " Explanation: The original statement \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly\" can be broken down into two parts: the hypothesis (the room was cleaned) and the conclusion (it was not cleaned thoroughly). This statement implies that even if the room was cleaned, it was not done thoroughly. However, the inference \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\" contradicts the original statement because it suggests that if the room was cleaned thoroughly, it was not cleaned at all, which is not a logical conclusion from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
