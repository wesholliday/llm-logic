            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much' is a conditional statement that can be written as \"Exercise => Not Exercise Much\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"Exercise Much => Not Exercise\", which is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the question asks about the inverse of the original statement, which is \"Exercise Much => Not Exercise\". The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement, so we cannot infer it from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
