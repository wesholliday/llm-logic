            "content": " Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"I went to the store\" and Q is \"I did not buy vegetables\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not Q, then not P\", which translates to \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store\". In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer that \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
