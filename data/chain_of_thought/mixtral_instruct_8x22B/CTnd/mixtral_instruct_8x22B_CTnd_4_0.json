            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently\" is a conditional statement that can be written as \"Ben studied -> Ben did not study diligently\". This statement implies that if Ben did study, then it was not done diligently. However, it does not provide any information about what would happen if Ben studied diligently.\n\nThe inference \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study\" is a different conditional statement, which can be written as \"Ben studied diligently -> Ben did not study\". This statement implies that if Ben studied diligently, then he did not study at all, which is not a logical conclusion from the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
