            "content": " Explanation: The original statement \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice\" is a conditional statement that can be broken down into two parts: the hypothesis (advice was offered) and the conclusion (it was not helpful advice). This statement tells us that whenever advice was offered, it was not helpful. However, it does not provide information about situations where helpful advice was offered.\n\nThe inference \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered\" is also a conditional statement, but it contradicts the original statement. The original statement implies that all offered advice was not helpful, but it does not exclude the possibility of helpful advice being offered. The inference assumes that if helpful advice was offered, then no advice was offered at all, which is not supported by the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered\" from the original statement \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
