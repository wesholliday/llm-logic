            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal\" is a conditional statement that can be written as \"Meal implies not Large Meal\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"Large Meal implies not Meal\", which is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the statement \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal\" is not the contrapositive of the original statement, but rather the inverse. The inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement, so we cannot infer \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal\" from \"If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
