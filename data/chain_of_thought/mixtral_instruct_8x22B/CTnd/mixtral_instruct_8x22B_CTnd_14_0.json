            "content": " Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"the meal was prepared\" and Q is \"it was not prepared carefully\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not Q, then not P\", which translates to \"If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared\". According to the principle of logical equivalence, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning they are either both true or both false. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true. However, in this case, the original statement seems to be a contradiction, as it implies that the meal was both prepared and not prepared carefully, which is logically inconsistent. Therefore, it is not possible to infer the truth of the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
