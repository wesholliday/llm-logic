            "content": " Explanation: The original statement \"If the job was completed, then it was not completed well\" can be rephrased as \"All completed jobs were not completed well.\" This implies that there is no job that was both completed and completed well. However, this does not mean that a job cannot be completed well. It just means that if a job was completed well, it would not fall under the category of jobs that were completed (according to the original statement). Therefore, the inference \"If the job was completed well, then it was not completed\" is not logically valid. This is because the original statement does not provide information about the possibility of a job being completed well, it only talks about jobs that were completed and not done well.\n\nAnswer: No.",
