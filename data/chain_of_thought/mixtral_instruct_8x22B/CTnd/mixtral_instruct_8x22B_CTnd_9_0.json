            "content": " Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"instructions were given\" and Q is \"they were not explained clearly.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not Q, then not P,\" which is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the contrapositive of the original statement is \"If instructions were explained clearly (not Q), then instructions were not given (not P).\"\n\nHowever, the original statement does not imply that the only reason instructions were not explained clearly is because they were not given. There could be other reasons why the instructions were not explained clearly, even if they were given. Therefore, we cannot infer that if instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given.\n\nAnswer: No.",
