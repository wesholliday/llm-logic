            "content": " Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement that can be written as \"If P, then not Q\", where P is \"Ann exercised\" and Q is \"Ann exercised strenuously\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If Q, then not P\", which can be written as \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise\". However, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer that \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
