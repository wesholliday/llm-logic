            "content": " Explanation: The original statement \"If a recommendation was made, then it was not a strong recommendation\" is a conditional statement that can be broken down into two parts: the hypothesis (a recommendation was made) and the conclusion (it was not a strong recommendation). This statement tells us that whenever a recommendation is made, it cannot be a strong recommendation.\n\nTo infer \"If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made\", we need to understand that this is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, if it is true that whenever a recommendation is made, it cannot be a strong recommendation, then it must also be true that whenever a strong recommendation is made, it cannot be considered a recommendation under the rules set by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
