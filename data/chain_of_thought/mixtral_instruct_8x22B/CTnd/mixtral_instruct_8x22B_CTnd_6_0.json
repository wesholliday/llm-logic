            "content": " Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"the clothes were washed\" and Q is \"they were not washed properly\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed\", which is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the contrapositive does not necessarily follow from the original statement in terms of real-world implications. The original statement suggests that if the clothes were washed, they were not washed properly, but it does not imply that the clothes could not have been washed properly. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed.\n\nAnswer: No.",
