            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid form of argument. The first premise presents two options as the only possibilities: either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden. The second premise eliminates one of the options by stating that Fido might not be in the garden. Since the first premise establishes that these are the only two possibilities, and the second premise eliminates one of them, it logically follows that the remaining option must be true. Therefore, the conclusion that Fido is inside is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
