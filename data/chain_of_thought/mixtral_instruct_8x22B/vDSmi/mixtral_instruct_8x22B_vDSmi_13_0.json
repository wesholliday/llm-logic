            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid form of argument. The first premise presents two options as the only possibilities: either the toy is in the toy box or it is on the shelf. The second premise eliminates one of those options by stating that the toy might not be on the shelf. Since the first premise establishes that there are only two possibilities and the second premise eliminates one of them, it logically follows that the remaining option must be true. Therefore, the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
