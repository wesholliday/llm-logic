The original premise states that going to the concert will result in having a good time, but it does not account for any other conditions or variables that may affect the outcome. The conclusion introduces a new condition (a bomb going off) that was not present in the original premise. This new condition significantly changes the context and the potential outcome, making the argument invalid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
