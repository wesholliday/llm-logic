However, the conclusion introduces a new condition, that the essay is turned in late, which is not accounted for in the premise. The logical validity of an argument depends on the structure of the argument, not the truth of its premises. In this case, the structure of the argument is flawed because the conclusion introduces a new condition that is not present in the premise.\n\nAnswer: No.",
