However, the conclusion introduces a new condition (wearing earplugs) that was not present in the original premise. The presence of earplugs could potentially change the outcome, as they are designed to protect the ears from loud noises. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: No.",
