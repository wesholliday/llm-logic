The original premise states that finishing homework is a sufficient condition for playing video games, but it does not account for other potential obstacles, such as a computer catching on fire. The conclusion adds an additional condition (my computer catches on fire) that is not present in the original premise, making the argument invalid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
