            "content": " Explanation: The argument is not logically valid. The original premise states that getting enough sleep is a sufficient condition for not being tired. However, the conclusion introduces a new condition (doing hard labor) and still claims that the person won't be tired. This is a logical fallacy because the original premise does not account for the effects of hard labor on tiredness. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
