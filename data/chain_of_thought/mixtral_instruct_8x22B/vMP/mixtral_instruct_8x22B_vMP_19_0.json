            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical structure known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument. In modus ponens, if the first premise is of the form 'If P, then Q' and the second premise is 'P', then the conclusion 'Q' follows necessarily. In this case, 'P' is 'Tom watched football' and 'Q' is 'Jen watched basketball'. Since both premises are true (according to the argument), the conclusion 'Jen watched basketball' must also be true. Therefore, this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
