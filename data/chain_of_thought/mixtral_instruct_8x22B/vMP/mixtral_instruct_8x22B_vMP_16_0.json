            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical construct known as modus ponens, which is a valid argument form. Modus ponens has two premises and a conclusion. The first premise is a conditional statement (if-then statement), and the second premise is the affirmation of the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional statement. The conclusion is the affirmation of the consequent (the \"then\" part) of the conditional statement. In this case, the first premise is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,\" the second premise is \"The shirt was cotton,\" and the conclusion is \"The pants were denim.\" Since the argument follows the form of modus ponens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
