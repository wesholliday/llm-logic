            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a hypothetical syllogism, specifically modus ponens, which is a logically valid argument form. The argument has two premises and a conclusion. The first premise is a conditional statement (if-then statement), and the second premise is the condition of the first premise. The conclusion is the result of the condition being met. In this case, the first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. The second premise states that the vampire was awake. Therefore, according to the rules of logic, the conclusion that the mummy was awake is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
