            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a basic logical structure known as modus ponens. Modus ponens is a rule of inference that states if P is true and \"P implies Q\" is true, then Q is true. In this case, P is the first premise \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and Q is the second premise \"The car was red\". Since both premises are true, according to the rule of modus ponens, the conclusion \"The truck was blue\" must also be true. Therefore, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
