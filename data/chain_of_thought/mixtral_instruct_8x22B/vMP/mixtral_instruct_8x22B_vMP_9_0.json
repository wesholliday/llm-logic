            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical construct known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument. In modus ponens, if the first statement (premise) is true, and the second statement (also a premise) is also true, then the conclusion must be true. In this case, the first premise is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt', which is a conditional statement (if p, then q). The second premise is 'Lisa bought the red shirt', which is the antecedent (p) of the conditional statement. Therefore, according to the rules of modus ponens, the conclusion 'Mark bought the blue shirt' must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
