            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a basic logical structure known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument. In modus ponens, if the first premise is 'If P, then Q' and the second premise is 'P', then the conclusion 'Q' logically follows. In this case, 'P' is 'The apple was red' and 'Q' is 'The banana was yellow'. Since both premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
