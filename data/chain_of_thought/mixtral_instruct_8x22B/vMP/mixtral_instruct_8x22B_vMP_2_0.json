            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical construct known as modus ponens, which is a valid argument form. Modus ponens has two premises and a conclusion. The first premise is a conditional statement of the form 'If P, then Q'. The second premise is an assertion that P is true. The conclusion is that Q is true. In this case, 'P' is 'The griffin was in the forest' and 'Q' is 'The unicorn was in the forest'. Since the argument follows the form of modus ponens, it is logically valid. Whether the argument is sound or not depends on whether the premises are actually true, but that is not relevant to the question of logical validity.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
