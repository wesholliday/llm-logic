            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. This statement tells us that if the first condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the second condition (Mark buying the blue shirt) is also true. However, this statement does not tell us anything about what happens when Lisa does not buy the red shirt. It is possible that Mark could still buy the blue shirt, or he might not. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
