            "content": " Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"The book was written by James\" and Q is \"The book is a mystery novel.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not Q, then not P,\" which is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the statement \"If not P, then not Q\" is the inverse of the original statement, which is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
