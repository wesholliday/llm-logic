            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. This statement tells us that if the condition (the doll being plastic) is true, then the conclusion (the truck being metal) is also true. However, it does not tell us anything about what happens when the condition is not true (i.e., when the doll is not plastic). Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal\" based solely on the given statement. This would be the inverse of the original statement, and the truth of the inverse cannot be determined from the truth of the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
