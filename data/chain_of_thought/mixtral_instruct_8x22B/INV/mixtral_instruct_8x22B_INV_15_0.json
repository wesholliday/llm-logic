            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. The contrapositive of this statement is \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\" The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the statement \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train\" is the inverse of the original statement, not the contrapositive. The inverse is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
