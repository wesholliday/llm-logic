            "content": " Explanation: The original statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. This statement tells us that if the condition (the car being red) is true, then the consequence (the truck being blue) is also true. However, it does not tell us anything about what happens when the condition is not true (i.e., the car is not red). Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\" based solely on the original statement. This would be an example of the logical fallacy known as \"denying the antecedent.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
