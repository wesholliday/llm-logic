            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. This statement tells us that if the condition (the cake being chocolate) is true, then the consequence (the muffins being blueberry) is also true. However, it does not tell us anything about what happens when the condition is not true (i.e., the cake is not chocolate). Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\" based solely on the given statement. This would be an example of the inverse of the original statement, which is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
