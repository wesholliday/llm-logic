            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. This statement tells us that if the first condition (Joe went to the park) is true, then the second condition (Lucy went to the zoo) is also true. However, it does not tell us anything about what happens when Joe does not go to the park. In logic, this is known as the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true, even if the original statement is true. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\" based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
