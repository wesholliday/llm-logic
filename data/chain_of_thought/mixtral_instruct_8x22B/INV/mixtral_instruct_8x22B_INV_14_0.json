            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" is a conditional statement, also known as a material implication. This statement tells us that if the antecedent (the bear was in the cave) is true, then the consequent (the wolf was in the den) must also be true. However, it does not tell us anything about what happens when the antecedent is false (the bear was not in the cave). Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den\" based solely on the given statement. This would be an example of the inverse of the original statement, which is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
