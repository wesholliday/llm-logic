This statement tells us that if the first condition (Sue choosing pizza) is true, then the second condition (Bob choosing pasta) is also true. However, it does not tell us anything about what happens when Sue does not choose pizza. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
