            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\". The original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. However, the statement \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim\" is not the contrapositive of the original statement, but rather the inverse of the original statement. The original statement and its inverse are not logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, we cannot infer that its inverse is also true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
