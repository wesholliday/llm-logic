            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. This statement tells us that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the conclusion (the banana being yellow) is also true. However, it does not tell us anything about what happens when the condition is not true (i.e., the apple is not red). Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\" based solely on the given statement. This would be an example of the logical fallacy known as \"denying the antecedent\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
