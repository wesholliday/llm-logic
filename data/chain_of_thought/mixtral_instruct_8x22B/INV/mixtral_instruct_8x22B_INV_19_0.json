            "content": " Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\". In this case, P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball\". The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". Therefore, the contrapositive of the original statement is \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\". However, the question asks about the inverse of the original statement, which is \"If not P, then not Q\". The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
