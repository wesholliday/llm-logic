            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" is a conditional statement that tells us about a specific situation where the presence of the griffin in the forest implies the presence of the unicorn in the forest. However, it does not provide any information about the situation where the griffin is not in the forest. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest\" because the unicorn could still be in the forest even if the griffin is not.\n\nAnswer: No.",
