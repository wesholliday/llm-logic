            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement that tells us about the relationship between Mary being at the wedding and Sue being at the wedding. Specifically, it tells us that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the conclusion (Sue being at the wedding) is also true. However, it does not tell us anything about what happens when the condition is not true (i.e., when Mary is not at the wedding). Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\" based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
