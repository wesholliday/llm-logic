            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is a conditional statement, also known as a sufficient condition. It means that if the condition (the vampire being awake) is true, then the consequence (the mummy being awake) is also true. However, it does not provide information about what happens when the condition is not true (the vampire is not awake). Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake\" because the mummy could still be awake even if the vampire is not. This is known as the inverse of the original statement, and it is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
