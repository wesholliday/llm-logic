            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is a conditional statement, also known as a sufficient condition. It means that if the condition (Alex finishing the race) is true, then the consequence (Chris finishing the race) is also true. However, it does not provide information about what happens when the condition is not met (Alex didn't finish the race). Therefore, we cannot infer that if Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race. Chris might have finished the race even if Alex didn't.\n\nAnswer: No.",
