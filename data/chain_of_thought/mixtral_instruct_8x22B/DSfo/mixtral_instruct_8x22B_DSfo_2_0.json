            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'Either the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf' is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. Given that 'The book isn't resting on the table' is true, we can infer that the other condition, 'The book is on the shelf', must be true in order for the disjunction to hold. This is based on the logical principle of disjunctive syllogism, which allows us to conclude that one of the disjuncts is true if we know that the other is false.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
