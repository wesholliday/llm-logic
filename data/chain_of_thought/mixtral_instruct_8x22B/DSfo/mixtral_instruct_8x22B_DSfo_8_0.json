            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"Either the remote control is hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table\" presents two possibilities for the location of the remote control. The first possibility is that the remote control is hiding under the couch, and the second possibility is that it is on the coffee table. However, we are given that \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch,\" which eliminates the first possibility. Since there are only two possibilities and we have eliminated one, we can infer that the remaining possibility is true. Therefore, the remote control must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
