            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside' is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two propositions must be true. Given that 'Fido is not in the garden' is true, the only remaining possibility is that 'Fido is inside'. This is because if both propositions were false (i.e., Fido is not in the garden and Fido is not inside), then the disjunction would be false, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, we can infer that 'Fido is inside'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
