            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'Either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer' is a logical disjunction, which means that one or both of the statements it connects must be true. If we know that 'The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet', then the only remaining possibility for the keys to be is 'in the drawer'. This is because the disjunction only allows for two possibilities, and we have already eliminated one of them. Therefore, we can infer that 'The keys are in the drawer'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
