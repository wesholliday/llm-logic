However, this statement does not take into account other factors that can cause tiredness, such as physical exertion. Therefore, even if you get enough sleep, doing hard labor can still make you tired. The original statement does not provide enough information to infer that getting enough sleep will prevent tiredness in all circumstances, including after doing hard labor.\n\nAnswer: No.",
