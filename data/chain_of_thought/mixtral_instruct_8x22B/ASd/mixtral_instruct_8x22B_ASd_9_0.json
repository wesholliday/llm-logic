            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A\" only considers the quality of the essay, not the timeliness of submission. The inference \"If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A\" introduces a new condition (turned in late) that is not accounted for in the original statement. In many grading systems, turning in work late can result in a deduction of points or even a failing grade, regardless of the quality of the work. Therefore, we cannot infer that a well-written essay turned in late will still result in an A.\n\nAnswer: No.",
