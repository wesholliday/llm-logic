            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. The first premise presents a disjunction (either A or B), and the second premise denies one of the disjuncts (not B). From this, we can validly conclude that the remaining disjunct is true (A). In this case, the first premise presents two possibilities for the location of the remote control: either it's on the coffee table or it's under the couch. The second premise denies the possibility that the remote control is under the couch. Therefore, we can validly conclude that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
