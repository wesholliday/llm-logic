However, we cannot infer from this statement that 'The glorp must be wozzle frazzle' because the statement does not exclude the possibility that the glorp could be 'blurble'. In logic, this is known as the Law of Detachment, which states that from a statement of the form 'P or Q', we cannot infer 'P' or 'Q' individually.\n\nAnswer: No.",
