            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry\" is a conditional statement. However, the statement \"the muffins might not have been blueberry\" introduces the possibility that the condition for the muffins being blueberry was not met. This does not necessarily mean that the cake was not chocolate, as the cake's flavor is not directly dependent on the muffins' flavor. It only means that the condition for the muffins being blueberry, given that the cake is chocolate, was not satisfied. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the cake was not chocolate based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
