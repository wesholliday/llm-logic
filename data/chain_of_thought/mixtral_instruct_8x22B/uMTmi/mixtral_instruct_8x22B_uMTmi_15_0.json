However, the statement \"Erin might not have taken a train\" introduces the possibility that Erin did not take a train. If Erin did not take a train, then according to the conditional statement, Sam could not have taken a plane. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
