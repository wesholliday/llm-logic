            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (the book was written by James) is true, then the conclusion (the book is a mystery novel) must also be true. However, the statement \"the book might not be a mystery novel\" introduces the possibility that the book is not a mystery novel, which contradicts the first statement. This contradiction does not necessarily mean that the book was not written by James, as it is possible that the book is a mystery novel and was written by James. It is also possible that the book is not a mystery novel and was not written by James. Therefore, we cannot infer that the book was not written by James based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
