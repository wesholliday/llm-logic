This means that if the first part (Ben eating pasta) is true, then the second part (Kate eating salad) must also be true. However, the statement \"Kate might not have eaten salad\" introduces the possibility that Kate did not eat salad. If Kate did not eat salad, then according to the conditional statement, Ben could not have eaten pasta. Therefore, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
