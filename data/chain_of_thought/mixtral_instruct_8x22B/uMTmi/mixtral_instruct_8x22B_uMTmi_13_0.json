            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\" is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the car was red) is true, then the conclusion (the truck must have been blue) must also be true. However, the statement \"the truck might not have been blue\" contradicts the conclusion of the conditional statement. This means that the condition (the car was red) cannot be true, because if it were, then the truck would have to be blue, which contradicts the statement that the truck might not have been blue. Therefore, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
