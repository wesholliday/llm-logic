            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the first part (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true. However, the statement \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\" introduces the possibility that Sue was not at the wedding. This does not directly contradict the first statement, because the first statement only applies if Mary was at the wedding. If Mary was not at the wedding, then the condition for Sue being at the wedding is not met, and Sue's presence or absence does not affect the truth of the first statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
