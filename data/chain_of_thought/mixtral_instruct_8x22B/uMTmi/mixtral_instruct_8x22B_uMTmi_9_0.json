            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the first part (the antecedent) is true, then the second part (the consequent) must also be true. However, if the consequent is not true, then the antecedent cannot be true either. This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nThe statement \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\" implies that the consequent of the original statement is not necessarily true. Therefore, according to the contrapositive, the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt) cannot be true either.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.",
