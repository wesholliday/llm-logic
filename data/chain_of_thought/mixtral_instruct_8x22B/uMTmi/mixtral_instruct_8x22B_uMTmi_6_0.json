It means that if the first part (Sue choosing pizza) is true, then the second part (Bob choosing pasta) must also be true. However, the statement \"Bob might not have chosen pasta\" introduces uncertainty. If Bob did not choose pasta, then according to the first statement, Sue could not have chosen pizza. Therefore, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
