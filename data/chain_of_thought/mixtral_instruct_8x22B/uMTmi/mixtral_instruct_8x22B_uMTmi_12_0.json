            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" is a conditional statement. It means that if the first part (Joe went to the park) is true, then the second part (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true. However, the statement \"Lucy might not have gone to the zoo\" introduces the possibility that Lucy did not go to the zoo. If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then according to the conditional statement, Joe could not have gone to the park. Therefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
