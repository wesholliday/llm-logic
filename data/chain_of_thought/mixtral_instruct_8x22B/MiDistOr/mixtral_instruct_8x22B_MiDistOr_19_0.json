            "content": " Explanation: The given statement \"The application might be completed online or in person\" is a compound sentence that presents two possible ways to complete the application. The word \"or\" in this context is used to separate the two options, indicating that the application can be completed either online or in person. This is equivalent to saying \"The application might be completed online or it might be completed in person,\" which explicitly separates the two options with the use of \"or\" and the repetition of \"it might be completed.\" Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
