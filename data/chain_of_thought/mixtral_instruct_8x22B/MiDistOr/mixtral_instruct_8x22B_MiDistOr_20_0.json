            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The event might be formal or semi-formal' is a compound statement that uses the conjunction 'or' to connect two possibilities: 'formal' and 'semi-formal'. This conjunction implies that the event could be either one of these options, but not necessarily both at the same time. Therefore, the statement can be inferred as 'The event might be formal or it might be semi-formal', which separates the two possibilities into distinct options.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
