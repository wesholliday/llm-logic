            "content": " Explanation: The original statement \"The document might be signed or notarized\" implies that the document could be in one of three states: unsigned and not notarized, signed but not notarized, or not signed but notarized. The statement does not explicitly state that the document could be signed without being notarized or vice versa, but it does imply that these are possibilities. Therefore, the inference \"The document might be signed or it might be notarized\" is a valid interpretation of the original statement, as it accurately reflects the possible states of the document.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
