            "content": " Explanation: The given statement \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or be cancelled\" is a compound sentence that presents two possible outcomes for the meeting. The word \"or\" in this context is used to separate these two possibilities. The sentence can be rephrased as \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or the meeting might be cancelled\" without changing its meaning. This is because the word \"or\" indicates that the two clauses are alternatives to each other. Therefore, it is possible to infer that \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or it might be cancelled\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
