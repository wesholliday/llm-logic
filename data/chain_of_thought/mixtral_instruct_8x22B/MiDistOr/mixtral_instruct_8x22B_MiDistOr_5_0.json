            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The package might be delivered today or tomorrow' is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the possibilities (delivery today or delivery tomorrow) is true. This is equivalent to saying 'The package might be delivered today or it might be delivered tomorrow', as both statements convey the same information about the possible delivery times. The original statement does not specify that both possibilities must occur, only that at least one of them will. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
