It does not provide any information about whether the movie had subtitles or not. Subtitles are not a necessary component of a movie, they are optional and can be added or removed depending on the audience's needs. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The movie must have been in English and had subtitles' based solely on the information that 'The movie must have been in English'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
