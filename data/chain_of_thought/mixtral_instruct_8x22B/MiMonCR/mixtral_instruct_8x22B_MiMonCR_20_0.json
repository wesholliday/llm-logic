            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The book might be a bestseller and adapted into a movie' implies that both events are possible outcomes, but they are not guaranteed. The use of 'and' suggests that these two events are connected, but it does not necessarily mean that one event is dependent on the other. Therefore, we can infer that 'The book might be adapted into a movie' because the statement suggests this as a possibility. However, it's important to note that this inference does not guarantee that the book will be adapted into a movie, only that it is a possibility.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
