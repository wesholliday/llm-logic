It does not provide any information about whether the package will be signed for upon delivery. The act of signing for a package is a separate process that may or may not occur, depending on the delivery service's requirements and the recipient's availability or preference. Therefore, we cannot infer that the package will be signed for just from the information that it might be delivered today.\n\nAnswer: No.",
