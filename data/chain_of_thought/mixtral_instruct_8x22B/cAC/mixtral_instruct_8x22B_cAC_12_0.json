In this case, 'Joe went to the park' is the hypothesis, and 'Lucy went to the zoo' is the conclusion. The statement 'Lucy went to the zoo' is the conclusion of the conditional statement, but it does not provide any information about the hypothesis, 'Joe went to the park'. Therefore, we cannot conclude that 'Joe went to the park' based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: No.",
