            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement, also known as a material implication. This means that if the first part (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true. However, this does not mean that the reverse is true. In other words, just because Sue was at the wedding, we cannot conclude that Mary was also at the wedding. The statement 'Sue was at the wedding' does not provide any information about Mary's presence at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No.",
