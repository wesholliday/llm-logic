            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The car must have been in the garage or at the repair shop' is a disjunction, which means that the car was in one of those two places. The phrase 'must have been' indicates that this is a necessary condition, so the car could not have been anywhere else. The inferred statement 'The car must have been in the garage or it must have been at the repair shop' is a restatement of the original disjunction, but with the two possibilities separated into individual statements. This separation does not change the meaning of the original statement, as it still maintains that the car was in one of those two places and could not have been anywhere else.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
