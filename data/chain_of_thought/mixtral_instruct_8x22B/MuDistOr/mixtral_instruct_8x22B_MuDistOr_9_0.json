            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"The package must have been delivered by truck or by plane\" is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the propositions (delivery by truck or delivery by plane) is true. This statement does not exclude the possibility that both propositions are true, i.e., the package could have been delivered by both truck and plane in different stages of its journey. However, the statement \"The package must have been delivered by truck or it must have been delivered by plane\" implies that only one of the propositions is true, excluding the possibility of both being true. Therefore, the latter statement is a more specific interpretation of the original statement, and it can be inferred from the original statement, but with the understanding that it introduces an additional constraint.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
