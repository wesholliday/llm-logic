            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. The first premise presents a disjunction (either/or statement), and the second premise negates one of the disjuncts. In this case, the first premise states that either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden, and the second premise states that Fido is not in the garden. Since the disjunction in the first premise is exclusive (meaning that only one of the disjuncts can be true), if one disjunct is false, then the other must be true. Therefore, if Fido is not in the garden, then Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
