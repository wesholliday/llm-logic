            "content": " Explanation: The given statements are \"The dreb was not vroombed\" and \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\". The first statement is a direct statement about the dreb not being vroombed. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the dreb being vroombed) is true, then the consequence (the dreb being spened) is also true. However, since the condition is not true (the dreb was not vroombed), we cannot infer anything about the consequence. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The dreb was not spened\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
