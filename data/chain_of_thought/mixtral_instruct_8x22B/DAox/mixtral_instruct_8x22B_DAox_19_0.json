            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The smonk was not vreebled' is the negation of the condition in the second statement 'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged'. In logic, this is known as the contrapositive. If the condition (the smonk was vreebled) is false, then the conclusion (the smonk plagged) cannot be true. Therefore, if the smonk was not vreebled, then it cannot have plagged.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
