            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The shank was not plooked' is the negation of the condition in the second statement 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged'. In logic, this is known as the contrapositive. If the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if the shank was not plooked, then according to the second statement, it cannot be true that the shank was nugged. This is because the condition for the shank to be nugged (i.e., it being plooked) is not met.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
