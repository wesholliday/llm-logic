            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"The splat was not morphed\" is given as true. The second statement is a conditional statement: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\". This statement can be interpreted as \"Being morphed is a necessary condition for the splat to quank\". Since we know that the splat was not morphed, it means that the necessary condition for the splat to quank was not met. Therefore, we can infer that the splat did not quank.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
