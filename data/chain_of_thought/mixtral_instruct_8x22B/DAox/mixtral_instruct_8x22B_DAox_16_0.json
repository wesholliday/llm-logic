            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The sneg was not crampled' is the negation of the condition in the second statement 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink'. In logic, this is known as the contrapositive. If the condition (the sneg was crampled) is false, then the conclusion (the sneg sproted the frink) cannot be true. Therefore, if the sneg was not crampled, then it did not sprot the frink.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
