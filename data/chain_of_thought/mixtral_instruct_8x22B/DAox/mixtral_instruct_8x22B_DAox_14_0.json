            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The clug was not fleeked' is the negation of the condition in the second statement 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged'. In logic, this is known as the contrapositive rule. If a statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. The contrapositive of 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged' is 'If the clug was not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked'. Since we know that 'The clug was not fleeked', we can infer that 'The clug was not snugged'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
