            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was not awake\" is a logical implication known as a conditional statement. This statement tells us that if the condition (the vampire being awake) is true, then the conclusion (the mummy not being awake) must also be true. However, this statement does not tell us anything about what happens when the condition is false (the vampire is not awake).\n\nThe inference \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake\" is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the original statement, we can indeed infer that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
