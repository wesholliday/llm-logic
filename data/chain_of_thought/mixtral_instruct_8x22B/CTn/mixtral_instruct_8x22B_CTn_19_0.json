            "content": " Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen did not watch basketball.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" Therefore, the contrapositive of the original statement is \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\" However, the question asks about the inverse of the original statement, which is \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\" The inverse and the original statement are not logically equivalent, so we cannot directly infer the inverse from the original statement. However, the inverse is actually the negation of the converse of the original statement, which is \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football.\" Since the original statement does not provide information about the converse, we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
