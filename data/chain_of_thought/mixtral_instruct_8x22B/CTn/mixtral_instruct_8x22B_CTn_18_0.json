            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was not metal\" is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. This statement can also be written as \"The doll is plastic implies the truck is not metal\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic\", which is logically equivalent to the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are either both true or both false. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
