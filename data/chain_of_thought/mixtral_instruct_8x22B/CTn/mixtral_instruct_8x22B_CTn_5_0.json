            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis' is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. The inverse of a conditional statement is created by switching the hypothesis (if part) and the conclusion (then part). In this case, the inverse would be 'If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball'. However, it's important to note that the inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that just because the original statement is true, it does not necessarily mean that the inverse is also true.\n\nHowever, in this specific case, the original statement and its inverse are actually logically equivalent. This is because both statements are expressing the same relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis, just in different ways. If Jeff playing basketball implies that Amy did not play tennis, then it must also be true that Amy playing tennis implies that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
