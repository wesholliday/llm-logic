The contrapositive of this statement is 'Bob chose pasta -> Sue did not choose pizza'. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if it is true that 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta', then it is also true that 'If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
