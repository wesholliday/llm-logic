            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest\" is a conditional statement that can be written as \"Griffin in forest -> Unicorn not in forest\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"Unicorn in forest -> Griffin not in forest\", which is logically equivalent to the original statement.
