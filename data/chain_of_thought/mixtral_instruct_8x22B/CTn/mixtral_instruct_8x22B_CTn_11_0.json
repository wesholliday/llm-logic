            "content": " Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were not blueberry\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not Q, then not P\", which translates to \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\". In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer that if the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
