            "content": " Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of the original statement is \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" Therefore, we can infer that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
