            "content": " Explanation: The original statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow\" is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red\", which is in the form of \"If not Q, then not P\". In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer that \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
