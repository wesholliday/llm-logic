            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den' is a conditional statement that describes a relationship between two events. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave'. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer that 'If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave' is true if the original statement is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
