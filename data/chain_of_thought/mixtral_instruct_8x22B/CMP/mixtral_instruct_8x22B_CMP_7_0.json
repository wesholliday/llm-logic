    "user_prompt": "Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it\u2019s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn\u2019t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn\u2019t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?",

            "content": " Explanation: Let's break down the information given and the logical steps to arrive at the conclusion.\n\n1. Tidal power is forecasted to generate the most electricity this year.\n2. Solar power is forecasted to generate the second most electricity this year.\n3. Wind power is forecasted to generate significantly less electricity than both tidal and solar power.\n4. If tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, then either solar power or wind power will.\n5. However, it's given that tidal power is likely to generate the most electricity, which implies that solar power is not likely to generate the most electricity.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where tidal power does not generate the most electricity. In this case, we have two possibilities: solar power or wind power generating the most electricity.\n\nGiven that solar power is not likely to generate the most electricity, it's reasonable to infer that if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, then it's likely that wind power will. This is because wind power is the only remaining major source of renewable energy, and it's been established that solar power is not likely to generate the most electricity.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
