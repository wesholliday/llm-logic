    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it\u2019s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be. Moreover, it\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

            "content": " Explanation: The statement suggests that apples are the most likely to be the top-selling fruit, followed by bananas, and then oranges. It also states that if apples aren't the top-selling fruit, then oranges will be. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that it's likely for oranges to be the top-selling fruit if apples aren't. The statement only suggests that oranges will be the top-selling fruit if both apples and bananas aren't. It doesn't provide any information about the likelihood of oranges being the top-selling fruit if apples aren't. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that it's likely for oranges to be the top-selling fruit if apples aren't.\n\nAnswer: No.",
