    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Spain, Brazil, and England have the best chances to win the World Cup. Based on betting odds, it is most likely Spain will win, followed closely by Brazil, with England having much lower odds. These teams have the only realistic chances, so if Brazil doesn\u2019t win, then if Spain doesn\u2019t win, England will win. Moreover, it is likely Spain will win and hence that Brazil won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Spain doesn\u2019t win, England will?",

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": " Explanation: The statement suggests that Spain has the highest likelihood of winning, followed by Brazil, and then England. It also states that if Spain doesn't win, then Brazil is the next most likely to win, and if Brazil doesn't win, then England will win. However, the statement that it is likely Spain will win and hence that Brazil won't win does not necessarily imply that it is likely that if Spain doesn't win, England will. This is because the likelihood of Brazil winning is not explicitly stated to be low enough to make England's victory likely in the event that Spain does not win.\n\nAnswer: No.",
