    "user_prompt": "Suppose that spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons. Forecasts show it's likely most vacations this year will happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with many fewer happening in the winter. These are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. Moreover, spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": " Explanation: The statement suggests that spring is the most likely season for vacations, followed by summer, and then winter. It also states that if spring doesn't have the most vacations, then summer is the next most likely season to have the most vacations. However, it is also stated that if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then winter will. Given that spring is the most likely season for vacations and that summer is the second most likely, it is unlikely that winter will have the most vacations unless both spring and summer do not. Therefore, it is not necessarily likely that if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will.\n\nAnswer: No.",
