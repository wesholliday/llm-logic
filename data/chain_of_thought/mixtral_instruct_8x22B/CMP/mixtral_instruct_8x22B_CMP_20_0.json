    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": " Explanation: The statement is based on the premise that coffee, tea, and soda are the only major morning drinks, and that market research indicates coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda being consumed much less in the mornings. The statement also assumes that if neither coffee nor tea retains the most morning drinkers, then soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Given that coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers, it follows that tea is unlikely to retain the most morning drinkers. Therefore, if coffee does not retain the most morning drinkers, it is likely that soda will retain the most morning drinkers, as it is the only remaining option.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
