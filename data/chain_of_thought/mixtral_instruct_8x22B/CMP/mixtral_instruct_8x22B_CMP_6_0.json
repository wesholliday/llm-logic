    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, and Beyonce have the top-selling albums this year. Industry experts project it's likely Taylor Swift's album will sell the most copies, followed closely by Bad Bunny's, with Beyonce's album far behind. These are the only top-sellers, so if Bad Bunny\u2019s album doesn\u2019t sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift\u2019s doesn\u2019t, Beyonce\u2019s will. Moreover, Taylor Swift\u2019s likely will sell the most and hence Bad Bunny's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will?",

            "content": " Explanation: The statement is about the likelihood of events based on the projections of industry experts. According to these projections, Taylor Swift's album is likely to sell the most copies, followed by Bad Bunny's, with Beyonce's album far behind. The statement also mentions that if Taylor Swift's album doesn't sell the most, then it's likely that Bad Bunny's will, unless Beyonce's album does. However, the statement does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood of Beyonce's album selling the most copies if Taylor Swift's doesn't. The fact that Taylor Swift's album is likely to sell the most does not necessarily mean that Beyonce's album is likely to sell the most if Taylor Swift's doesn't. It's possible that Bad Bunny's album could still sell more than Beyonce's, even if it doesn't sell the most overall.\n\nAnswer: No.",
