    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don\u2019t increase the most, then if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won\u2019t increase the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

            "content": " Explanation: The statement is based on the premise that rents are expected to increase the most, followed by home prices, and then mortgage rates. It is also stated that if rents don't increase the most, then mortgage rates will increase the most. However, this is a conditional statement that only applies if home prices don't increase the most. Given that economists project rents to increase the most and home prices to increase less than rents but more than mortgage rates, it is unlikely that home prices will increase the most. Therefore, if rents don't increase the most, it is likely that mortgage rates will increase the most, as they are the only other major housing cost expected to rise substantially.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
