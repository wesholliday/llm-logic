    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": " Explanation: The statement suggests that Tennessee is expected to add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. It also states that if Tennessee and Georgia don't add the most jobs, then Missouri will. However, the statement also suggests that it's likely that Tennessee will add the most jobs, which implies that it's unlikely that Georgia or Missouri will add more jobs than Tennessee. Therefore, it's not necessarily likely that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will. It's possible that Georgia could add more jobs than Tennessee, as it's expected to have the second-highest job growth.\n\nAnswer: No.",
