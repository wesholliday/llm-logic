The statement \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" eliminates one of those possibilities. However, this does not definitively confirm that the notebook is in the drawer. It is possible that the notebook is in a third location that was not mentioned in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The notebook is in the drawer\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
