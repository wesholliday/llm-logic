            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" presents two possibilities for the location of the book. The statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" eliminates one of those possibilities. Since the book cannot be in both places at once, and we know it is not on the table, we can infer that the book must be on the shelf.
