            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two propositions must be true. The statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" is a negation of one of the propositions in the disjunction. Since the disjunction states that at least one of the propositions must be true, and we know that \"Fido might not be in the garden\" is a possibility, it follows that the other proposition, \"Fido is inside,\" must be true. This is because if \"Fido is inside\" were not true, then the only remaining possibility would be that \"Fido must be in the garden,\" which contradicts the statement that \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" Therefore, we can infer that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
