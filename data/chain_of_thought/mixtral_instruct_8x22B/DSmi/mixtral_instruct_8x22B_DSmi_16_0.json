The statement \"The pen might not be on my desk\" eliminates one of those possibilities. However, this does not definitively confirm that the pen is in the bag. It could be in a third location that was not mentioned in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The pen is in my bag\" based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
