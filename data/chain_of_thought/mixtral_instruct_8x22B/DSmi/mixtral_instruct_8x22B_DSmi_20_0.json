The statement \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" introduces uncertainty about one of those possibilities. However, this does not definitively confirm that the sunglasses are in her bag. It only suggests that the possibility of the sunglasses being on her head is less likely. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The sunglasses are in her bag\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
