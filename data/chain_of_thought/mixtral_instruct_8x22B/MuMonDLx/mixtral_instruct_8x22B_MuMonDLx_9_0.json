            "content": " Explanation: In logic, the principle of addition or \"addition rule\" allows us to infer a disjunction (or) from a single statement. This means that if we know a statement P is true, we can infer that either P or Q is true, where Q is any other statement. In this case, the statement \"The zibble must be glorp\" is our P, and \"The zibble must be plonk\" is our Q. Since we know that the zibble must be glorp, we can infer that the zibble must be either glorp or plonk. This is because the original statement is already included in the disjunction, so the disjunction must be true if the original statement is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
