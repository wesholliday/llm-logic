            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The wozzle must be floob' is a specific claim that the wozzle has the attribute of being floob. The statement 'The wozzle must be floob or glorp' is a broader claim that the wozzle has the attribute of being either floob or glorp. In logic, if a statement is true, then any statement that is broader in scope is also true. This is known as the principle of addition or the principle of or-introduction. Therefore, if 'The wozzle must be floob' is true, then 'The wozzle must be floob or glorp' is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
