            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The frazzle must be crunk zump' is a specific claim about the state of the frazzle. When we say 'The frazzle must be crunk zump or flibbit floob', we are introducing an additional possibility for the state of the frazzle. This new statement is a broader claim that includes the original statement as one of its possibilities.
