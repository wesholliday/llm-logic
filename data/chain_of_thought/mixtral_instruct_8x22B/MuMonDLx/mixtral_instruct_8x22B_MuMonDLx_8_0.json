            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The grazzle must be snork on zibble' is a specific condition where the 'grazzle' must be 'snork' on 'zibble'. The second statement 'The grazzle must be snork on zibble or wump wump wozzle' introduces an additional condition 'wump wump wozzle'. This new statement is broader in scope because it includes the original condition and adds an additional possibility. Therefore, the original statement can be inferred from the second statement, but not the other way around.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
