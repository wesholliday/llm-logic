            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of a logical operation known as disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid argument form. The original statement is a disjunction (either...or), and the second statement is the negation of one of the disjuncts. In this case, the disjunctive syllogism allows us to infer that the remaining disjunct is true. Since the missing sock is either in the laundry basket or under the bed, and we know it's not under the bed, we can infer that it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
