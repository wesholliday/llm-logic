            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of a logical operation called disjunctive syllogism, where we have a statement in the form of \"either A or B\" and then we learn that \"not B\" is true. From this, we can infer that \"A\" must be true. In this case, \"A\" is \"the keys are in the drawer\" and \"B\" is \"the keys are dangling in the cabinet\". Since we know that \"the keys aren't dangling in the cabinet\", we can infer that \"the keys are in the drawer\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
