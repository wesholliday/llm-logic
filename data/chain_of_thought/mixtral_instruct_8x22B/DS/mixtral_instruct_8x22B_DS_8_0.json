            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch\" is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two propositions must be true. The second statement \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch\" negates one of the propositions in the disjunction. Therefore, by the process of elimination, we can infer that the remaining proposition must be true. In this case, the only remaining possibility is that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
