            "content": " Explanation: This logical argument is an example of a form of reasoning called \"disjunctive syllogism\". Disjunctive syllogism is a valid argument form, where if we have two statements connected by \"or\" (a disjunction), and we know that one of them is false, then we can infer that the other statement is true.\n\nIn this case, the first statement is \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf\", which is a disjunction. The second statement is \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf\", which negates one of the disjuncts. Therefore, according to the rules of disjunctive syllogism, we can infer that the other disjunct is true, i.e., \"The toy is in the toy box\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
