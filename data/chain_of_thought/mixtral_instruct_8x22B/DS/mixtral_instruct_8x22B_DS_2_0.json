            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table' is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two propositions must be true. The second statement 'The book isn't resting on the table' negates one of the propositions in the disjunction. Therefore, by the process of elimination, we can infer that the remaining proposition 'The book is on the shelf' must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
