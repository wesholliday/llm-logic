            "content": " Explanation: This is a classic example of logical reasoning using disjunction (OR) and negation. The statement 'Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden' is a disjunction, which means at least one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement 'Fido is not in the garden' is a negation, which means the condition that Fido is in the garden is false. Since the disjunction must be true and one of the conditions is false, the other condition must be true. Therefore, we can infer that 'Fido is inside'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
