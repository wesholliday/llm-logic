            "content": " Explanation: We have two statements here that can be treated as premises for our logical deduction. The first statement is a conditional one: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened.\" This can be written as \"vroombed => spened\" in logical notation. The second statement is \"The dreb might not have been spened,\" which can be interpreted as the negation of the consequent in our conditional statement. In logical notation, this would be \"~spened.\"\n\nNow, we are trying to infer whether \"The dreb was not vroombed\" (or \"~vroombed\") is true based on these premises. In logic, if we have a conditional statement \"P => Q\" and we know that \"~Q\" is true, then we can infer that \"~P\" must be true. This is known as the principle of contrapositive.\n\nApplying this principle to our premises, if \"vroombed => spened\" and \"~spened\" are true, then \"~vroombed\" must be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The dreb was not vroombed\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
