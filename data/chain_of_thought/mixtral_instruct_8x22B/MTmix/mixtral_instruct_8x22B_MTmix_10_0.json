            "content": " Explanation: We have two statements to consider:\n1. If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled.\n2. It might not have been garpled.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that sproinging leads to garpling. This is a conditional statement, where sproinging is the sufficient condition for garpling. In other words, if the wug was sproinged, it definitely was garpled.\n\nThe second statement introduces uncertainty about whether the wug was garpled or not. It suggests that there is a possibility that the wug was not garpled.\n\nNow, if we combine these two statements, we can infer that if there is a possibility that the wug was not garpled, then it must not have been sproinged. This is because, according to the first statement, sproinging always leads to garpling. If the wug was not garpled, then it could not have been sproinged.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
