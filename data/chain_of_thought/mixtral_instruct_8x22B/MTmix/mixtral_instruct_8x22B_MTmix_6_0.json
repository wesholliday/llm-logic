            "content": " Explanation: The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be written as \"If P then Q\", where P is \"the grommet was sploffed\" and Q is \"the grommet must have plopped the frink\". The second statement is a negation of Q, which can be written as \"Not Q\". In logic, if a conditional statement is true and its consequent (Q) is false, then its antecedent (P) must also be false. Therefore, if the grommet might not have plopped the frink (Not Q), then it must be true that the grommet was not sploffed (Not P).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
