            "content": " Explanation: We have two statements to consider:\n1. If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled. This is a conditional statement, where cranking the sprocket is the sufficient condition for it to be daggled.\n2. The sprocket might not have been daggled. This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the sprocket was not daggled.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that if there is a possibility that the sprocket was not daggled, then it must not have been cranked. This is because, according to the first statement, cranking the sprocket would definitely lead to it being daggled. If the sprocket was not daggled, then it could not have been cranked.\n\nThis is an application of the logical rule of inference known as modus tollens, which states that if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P is false. In this case, P is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and Q is \"the sprocket was daggled\". Since Q might be false (the sprocket might not have been daggled), we can infer that P is false (the sprocket was not cranked).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
