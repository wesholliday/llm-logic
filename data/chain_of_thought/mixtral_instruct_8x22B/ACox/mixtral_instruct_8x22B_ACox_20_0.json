However, just because we know that the conclusion is true (the wug was garpled), we cannot infer that the hypothesis is also true (the wug was sproinged). This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The wug could have been garpled due to some other reason, not necessarily because it was sproinged.\n\nAnswer: No.",
