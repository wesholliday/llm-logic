            "content": " Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not Q, then not P\", which is equivalent to \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\". In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer that if the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
