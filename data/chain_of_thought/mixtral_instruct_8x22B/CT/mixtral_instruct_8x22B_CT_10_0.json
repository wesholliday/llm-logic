            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. This statement can be written as \"Dog inside -> Cat outside\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"Cat not outside -> Dog not inside\". In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if it is true that \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\", then it is also true that \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
