            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. The inverse of this statement is 'If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane'. However, the inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that just because the original statement is true, it does not necessarily mean that the inverse is also true. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane' from 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
