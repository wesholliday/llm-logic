            "content": " Explanation: The original statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. This statement can also be written as \"The car being red implies that the truck is blue.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\" In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, from the original statement, we can infer that if the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
