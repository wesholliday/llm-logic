            "content": " Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not Q, then not P,\" which is equivalent to \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer that if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
