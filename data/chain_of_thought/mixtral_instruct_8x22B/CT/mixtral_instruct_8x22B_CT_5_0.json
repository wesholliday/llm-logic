            "content": " Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" Therefore, the contrapositive of the original statement is \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\" Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer that if Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
