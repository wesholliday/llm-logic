            "content": " Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not Q, then not P,\" which is equivalent to \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\" In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
