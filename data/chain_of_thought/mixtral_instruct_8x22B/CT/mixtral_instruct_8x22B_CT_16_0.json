            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. The inverse of this statement is \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\". However, the inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot directly infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nIn this case, if the pants were not denim, it does not necessarily mean that the shirt was not cotton. The shirt could still be cotton, and the pants could be made of a different material. The original statement only tells us about what happens when the shirt is cotton, not what happens when the pants are not denim.\n\nAnswer: No.",
