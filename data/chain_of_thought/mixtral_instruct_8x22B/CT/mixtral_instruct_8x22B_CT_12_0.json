            "content": " Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" Therefore, the contrapositive of the original statement is \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\" Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer that if Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
