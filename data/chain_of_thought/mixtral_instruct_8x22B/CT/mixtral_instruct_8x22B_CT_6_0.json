            "content": " Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q is \"Bob chose pasta\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not Q, then not P\", which is equivalent to \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\". In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer that if Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
