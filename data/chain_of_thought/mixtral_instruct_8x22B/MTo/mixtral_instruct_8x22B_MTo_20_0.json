            "content": " Explanation: We have two statements here. The first statement is \"The banana was not yellow,\" which is a direct statement about the color of the banana. The second statement is a conditional statement, \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This statement tells us that if a certain condition (the apple being red) is met, then a certain result (the banana being yellow) will follow.\n\nHowever, we know from the first statement that the banana was not yellow. This means that the condition in the second statement (the apple being red) could not have been met, because if it had been, the banana would have been yellow. Therefore, we can infer that the condition did not occur, and the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
