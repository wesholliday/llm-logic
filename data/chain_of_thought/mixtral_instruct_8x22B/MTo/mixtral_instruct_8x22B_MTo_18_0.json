            "content": " Explanation: We have two statements to consider:\n1. The truck was not metal.\n2. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. It states that if a certain condition is met (the doll is plastic), then a certain result will follow (the truck is metal). However, we know from the first statement that the truck is not metal. Therefore, the condition in the second statement (the doll is plastic) cannot be true, because if it were, the truck would have to be metal, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nSo, if the truck is not metal, and the doll being plastic would imply that the truck is metal, then the doll cannot be plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
