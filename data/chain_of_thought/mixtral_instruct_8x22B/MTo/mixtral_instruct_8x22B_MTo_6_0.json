            "content": " Explanation: We have two statements that can be considered as premises for our logical deduction. The first premise is \"Bob did not choose pasta,\" and the second premise is \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" In logic, the second premise is a conditional statement, where \"Sue chose pizza\" is the hypothesis, and \"Bob chose pasta\" is the conclusion.\n\nNow, we are given that the conclusion of the conditional statement is false, i.e., \"Bob did not choose pasta.\" According to the logical principle called modus tollens, if a conditional statement is true and its conclusion is false, then the hypothesis must also be false. Therefore, if \"Bob did not choose pasta\" is true, and the conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is true, then it must be true that \"Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
