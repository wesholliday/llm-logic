            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements:\n1. Jen did not watch basketball.\n2. If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. In a conditional statement, the \"if\" clause is called the hypothesis, and the \"then\" clause is called the conclusion. In this case, the hypothesis is \"Tom watched football,\" and the conclusion is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement is false only when the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false. In all other cases, the conditional statement is true.\n\nGiven that Jen did not watch basketball (which is the conclusion of the conditional statement), and knowing that a conditional statement is false only when the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false, we can infer that the hypothesis \"Tom watched football\" must be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
