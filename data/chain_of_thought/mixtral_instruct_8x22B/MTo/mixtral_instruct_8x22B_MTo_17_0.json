The second statement is a conditional statement, which can be broken down into two parts: the hypothesis (Ben ate pasta) and the conclusion (Kate ate the salad).\n\nSince we know that Kate did not eat the salad, we can infer that the conclusion of the conditional statement is false. In a conditional statement, if the conclusion is false, then the hypothesis must also be false. Therefore, if Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
