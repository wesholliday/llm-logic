If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be broken down into two parts: the hypothesis (Joe went to the park) and the conclusion (Lucy went to the zoo). The statement says that if the hypothesis is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nHowever, we know from the first statement that Lucy did not go to the zoo. This means that the conclusion of the conditional statement is false. In a conditional statement, if the conclusion is false, then the hypothesis must also be false. Therefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
