            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements:\n1. Erin did not take a train.\n2. If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. In this case, the condition is \"Sam took a plane,\" and the consequence is \"Erin took a train.\"\n\nWe can analyze the statements using logical reasoning:\n- From the first statement, we know that Erin did not take a train.\n- The second statement tells us that if Sam took a plane, then Erin would have taken a train. However, we know that Erin did not take a train.\n- Therefore, the condition for the second statement (Sam took a plane) cannot be true, because if it were true, the consequence (Erin took a train) would also have to be true, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nSince the condition for the second statement cannot be true, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
