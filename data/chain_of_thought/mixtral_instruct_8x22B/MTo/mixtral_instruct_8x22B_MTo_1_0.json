            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement, where 'Mary was at the wedding' is the hypothesis and 'Sue was at the wedding' is the conclusion. The negation of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the negation of the hypothesis. In this case, the negation of the hypothesis 'Mary was at the wedding' is 'Mary was not at the wedding'. Since we know that 'Sue was not at the wedding', which is the negation of the conclusion, we can infer that the hypothesis must also be false, according to the logical principle of modus tollens. Therefore, we can infer that 'Mary was not at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
