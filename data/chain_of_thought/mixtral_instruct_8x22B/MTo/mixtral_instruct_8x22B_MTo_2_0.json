            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements:\n1. The unicorn was not in the forest.\n2. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. It can be broken down into two parts: the hypothesis (if the griffin was in the forest) and the conclusion (then the unicorn was in the forest).\n\nWe know from the first statement that the unicorn was not in the forest. This contradicts the conclusion of the second statement, which says that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn would be in the forest. Since the unicorn is not in the forest, the hypothesis of the second statement (the griffin being in the forest) must be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
