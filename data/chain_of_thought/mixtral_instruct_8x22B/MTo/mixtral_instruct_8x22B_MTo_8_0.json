If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be rewritten as \"The vampire being awake implies that the mummy is awake.\" Since we know that the mummy was not awake (from the first statement), we can use the contrapositive of the second statement to infer the state of the vampire. The contrapositive of the second statement is \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\" Since the mummy was not awake, according to the contrapositive, the vampire was not awake either.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
