            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements:\n1. Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n2. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. In this case, the condition is \"Lisa bought the red shirt,\" and the consequence is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nSince we know that Mark did not buy the blue shirt (from the first statement), we can infer that the condition for the second statement (Lisa buying the red shirt) did not occur. This is because if the condition had occurred (Lisa buying the red shirt), then the consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt) would have also occurred, according to the second statement. However, we know that the consequence did not occur (Mark did not buy the blue shirt), so the condition must not have occurred either.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
