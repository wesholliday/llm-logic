            "content": " Explanation: We have two statements here. The first statement is a direct statement that the book is not a mystery novel. The second statement is a conditional statement, which can be broken down as follows: If P, then Q. Here, P is 'The book was written by James' and Q is 'The book is a mystery novel'. The contrapositive of this conditional statement is also true, which is: If not Q, then not P. This means that if the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James. Since the first statement tells us that the book is not a mystery novel, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
