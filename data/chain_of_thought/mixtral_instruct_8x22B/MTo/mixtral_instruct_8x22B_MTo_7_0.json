            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements:\n1. Chris did not finish the race.\n2. If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. In this case, the condition is \"Alex finished the race\" and the consequence is \"Chris finished the race\". However, we know from the first statement that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nIn logic, if a conditional statement is true and its consequence is false, then the condition must also be false. This is known as the principle of contrapositive. Therefore, if Chris did not finish the race (the consequence is false), then it must be true that Alex did not finish the race (the condition is false).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
