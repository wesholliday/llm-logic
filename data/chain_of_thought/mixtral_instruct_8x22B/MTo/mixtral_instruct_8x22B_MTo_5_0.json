            "content": " Explanation: We have two statements:\n1. Amy did not play tennis.\n2. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. It can be broken down into two parts: the hypothesis (Jeff played basketball) and the conclusion (Amy played tennis). The statement says that if the hypothesis is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nHowever, we know from the first statement that Amy did not play tennis. This means that the conclusion of the conditional statement is false. In a conditional statement, if the conclusion is false, then the hypothesis must also be false. Therefore, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
