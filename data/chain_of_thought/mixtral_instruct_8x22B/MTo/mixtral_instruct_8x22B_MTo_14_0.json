            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements:\n1. The wolf was not in the den.\n2. If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. In this case, the condition is \"the bear was in the cave\" (the \"if\" part), and the consequence is \"the wolf was in the den\" (the \"then\" part).\n\nSince we know that the wolf was not in the den (from the first statement), we can infer that the condition for the wolf being in the den (i.e., the bear being in the cave) did not occur. This is because if the bear had been in the cave, the wolf would have been in the den, according to the second statement. However, since the wolf was not in the den, the bear must not have been in the cave.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
