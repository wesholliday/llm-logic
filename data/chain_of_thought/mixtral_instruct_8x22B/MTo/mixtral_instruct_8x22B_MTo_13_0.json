            "content": " Explanation: We have two statements to consider:\n1. The truck was not blue.\n2. If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. In this case, the condition is \"the car was red,\" and the consequence is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\nWe can analyze this using the concept of contrapositive in logic. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of the second statement is: \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\"\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the truck was not blue, we can apply the contrapositive to infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
