            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta' is a conditional statement, where 'Sue chose pizza' is the hypothesis and 'Bob chose pasta' is the conclusion. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza'. According to the principle of logical equivalence, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning they are either both true or both false. Since we know that 'Bob did not choose pasta', we can infer that the contrapositive is true, and therefore, 'Sue did not choose pizza'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
