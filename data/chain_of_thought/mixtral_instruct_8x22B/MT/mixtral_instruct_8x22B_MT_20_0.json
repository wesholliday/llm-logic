            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements:\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. (This is a conditional statement, where \"the apple was red\" is the hypothesis and \"the banana was yellow\" is the conclusion.)\n2. The banana was not yellow. (This is the negation of the conclusion from the first statement.)\n\nFrom these two statements, we can use the concept of contrapositive to infer the truth of the statement \"The apple was not red.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of the first statement is: If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\n\nSince we know that the banana was not yellow (from the second statement), we can apply the contrapositive to infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
