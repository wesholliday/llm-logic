            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument that uses a conditional statement and its contrapositive. The original statement is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad,\" which can be written as \"Ben ate pasta -> Kate ate the salad.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta,\" which can be written as \"~Kate ate the salad -> ~Ben ate pasta.\" Since we know that \"Kate did not eat the salad\" (~Kate ate the salad), we can use the contrapositive to infer that \"Ben did not eat pasta\" (~Ben ate pasta).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
