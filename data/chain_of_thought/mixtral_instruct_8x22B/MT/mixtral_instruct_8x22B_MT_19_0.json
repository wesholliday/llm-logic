            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' is a conditional statement, where 'Tom watched football' is the hypothesis and 'Jen watched basketball' is the conclusion. The negation of the conclusion implies the negation of the hypothesis in a conditional statement. In this case, since 'Jen did not watch basketball' is the negation of the conclusion, we can infer that 'Tom did not watch football', which is the negation of the hypothesis.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
