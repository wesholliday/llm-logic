            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement, also known as a material implication. This means that if the first part (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true. However, if the second part is false (as given by \"Sue was not at the wedding\"), then the first part cannot be true. This is because if Mary was indeed at the wedding, then Sue would also have to be at the wedding, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
