            "content": " Explanation: We have two statements that can be treated as logical propositions. The first statement is a conditional proposition of the form 'If P, then Q', where P is 'The cake was chocolate' and Q is 'The muffins were blueberry'. The second statement is a negation of Q, which is 'The muffins were not blueberry'.\n\nIn logic, if a statement 'If P, then Q' is true and the negation of Q is also true, then the negation of P must be true as well. This is known as the principle of transposition or contrapositive. In this case, if the cake was indeed chocolate, then the muffins would have to be blueberry. However, we know that the muffins were not blueberry. Therefore, it must be the case that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
