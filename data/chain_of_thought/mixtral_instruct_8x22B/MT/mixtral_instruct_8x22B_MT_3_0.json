            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements:\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. (This can be written as \"James -> Mystery Novel\")\n2. The book is not a mystery novel. (This can be written as \"Not Mystery Novel\")\n\nWe want to know if we can infer that the book was not written by James (Not James).\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be thought of as \"If P, then Q.\" In this case, P is \"The book was written by James\" and Q is \"The book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nThe second statement is the negation of Q, which is \"The book is not a mystery novel.\"\n\nIn logic, the negation of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nSo, if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we know that \"Not Q\" is true, then we can infer that \"Not P\" is true.\n\nTherefore, if the book is not a mystery novel, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
