            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements:\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. (This is a conditional statement, where the doll being plastic is the hypothesis and the truck being metal is the conclusion.)\n2. The truck was not metal. (This is a negation of the conclusion from the first statement.)\n\nFrom these two statements, we can use the concept of contrapositive to infer the statement about the doll. The contrapositive of the first statement is: If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic. Since the second statement tells us that the truck was not metal, we can apply the contrapositive to infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
