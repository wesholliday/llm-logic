            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. In this case, 'Lisa bought the red shirt' is the hypothesis (or antecedent), and 'Mark bought the blue shirt' is the conclusion (or consequent). The statement 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt' is the negation of the conclusion.\n\nIn logic, if the hypothesis of a conditional statement is true, then the conclusion must also be true. However, if the conclusion is false (as in this case, 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt'), then the hypothesis must also be false. This is known as the contrapositive rule.\n\nTherefore, if 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt', we can infer that 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'. This is because if Lisa had bought the red shirt, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt, according to the original statement. But since Mark did not buy the blue shirt, Lisa must not have bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
