            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of logical reasoning using a type of argument called \"modus tollens\". In the statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\", we have a conditional statement where \"Sam took a plane\" is the hypothesis and \"Erin took a train\" is the conclusion. The modus tollens rule states that if the conclusion of a conditional statement is false, then the hypothesis must also be false. In this case, we are given that \"Erin did not take a train\", which means the conclusion is false. Therefore, according to the modus tollens rule, the hypothesis \"Sam took a plane\" must also be false.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
