            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements:\n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. This can be written as a conditional statement: Shirt is cotton -> Pants are denim.\n2. The pants were not denim. This can be written as: Pants are not denim.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the condition for the first statement (Pants are denim) is false. In a conditional statement, if the consequent (the \"then\" part) is false, we cannot determine the truth value of the antecedent (the \"if\" part) directly. However, in this case, since the consequent is false, and the only way for the conditional statement to be true is if both the antecedent and consequent are true, we can infer that the antecedent must be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
