This statement can also be written as 'The vampire being awake implies the mummy is awake'.\n\nThe second statement is 'The mummy was not awake', which is the negation of the conclusion in the conditional statement.\n\nIn logic, if a statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. The contrapositive of 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake'.\n\nSince the second statement tells us that 'The mummy was not awake', we can apply the contrapositive to infer that 'The vampire was not awake'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
