            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. In this case, \"the car was red\" is the hypothesis, and \"the truck was blue\" is the conclusion. The statement \"The truck was not blue\" is the negation of the conclusion. In logic, if the hypothesis of a conditional statement is true, then the conclusion must also be true. However, if the conclusion is false (as in this case), then the hypothesis must also be false. Therefore, if the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
