            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements:\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. (This can also be written as \"Joe going to the park implies Lucy went to the zoo.\")\n2. Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that Lucy did not go to the zoo. Since the first statement tells us that Joe going to the park would imply Lucy going to the zoo, and we know that Lucy did not go to the zoo, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park. This is because if Joe had gone to the park, the first statement would require Lucy to have gone to the zoo, which contradicts the second statement. Therefore, the only possibility left is that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
