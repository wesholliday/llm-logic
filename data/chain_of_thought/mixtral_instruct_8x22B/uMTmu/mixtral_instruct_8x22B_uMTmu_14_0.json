It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den.\n\nFrom the second statement, we can infer that the wolf was not in the den. Since the first statement is a conditional statement (if A then B), and we know that B did not happen (the wolf was not in the den), we can infer that A did not happen either (the bear was not in the cave). This is based on the logical principle of modus tollens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and its consequent (B) is false, then its antecedent (A) must be false as well.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
