            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the first part (the antecedent) is true, then the second part (the consequent) must also be true. However, the statement \"it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" contradicts the consequent of the conditional statement. This means that the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt) cannot be true, because if it were, then the consequent (Mark must have bought the blue shirt) would also have to be true, which we know is not the case. Therefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
