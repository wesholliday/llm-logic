It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the muffins were not necessarily blueberry. Since the first statement tells us that the muffins being blueberry is a direct consequence of the cake being chocolate, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate. This is because if the cake were chocolate, then the muffins would have to be blueberry, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
