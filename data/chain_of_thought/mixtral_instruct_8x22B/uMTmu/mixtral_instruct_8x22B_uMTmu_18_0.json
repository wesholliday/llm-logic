It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the truck was not necessarily metal. This contradicts the first statement, which says that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. Since the truck was not necessarily metal, it means that the condition for the doll being plastic was not met. Therefore, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
