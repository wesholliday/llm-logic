It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the pants were not necessarily denim. This means that the condition for the first statement (the shirt being cotton) was not met. If the condition for the first statement is not met, then we cannot make any inference about the material of the shirt. However, since the first statement suggests a direct relationship between the shirt being cotton and the pants being denim, and we know that the pants were not necessarily denim, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
