It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that all books written by James are mystery novels. However, this does not mean that all mystery novels are written by James.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the book in question is not necessarily a mystery novel. This means that the book could be any genre, including but not limited to mystery.\n\nSince the book is not necessarily a mystery novel, we cannot infer that it was written by James. This is because the first statement only tells us about the books written by James, not about all mystery novels or books in general.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the book was not written by James.",
