            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements: (1) If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo; and (2) It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. From statement (2), we can infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo. Since statement (1) tells us that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo, and we know that Lucy did not go to the zoo, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park. This is because the contrapositive of statement (1) is also true: If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
