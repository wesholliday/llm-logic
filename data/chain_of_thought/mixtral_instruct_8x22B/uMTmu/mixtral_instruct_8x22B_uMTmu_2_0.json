            "content": " Explanation: We have two statements here that seem to contradict each other. The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be written as \"If P then Q,\" where P is \"the griffin was in the forest\" and Q is \"the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" The second statement is the negation of Q, which can be written as \"Not Q.\"\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P then Q\" and we know that Q is false (Not Q), then we can infer that P must also be false. This is known as the rule of transposition or contrapositive.\n\nTherefore, if it's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest (Not Q), then we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest (Not P).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
