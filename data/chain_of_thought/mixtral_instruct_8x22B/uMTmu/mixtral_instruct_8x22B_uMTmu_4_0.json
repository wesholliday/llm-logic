It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the robot did not visit Jupiter. Since the first statement is a conditional statement (if-then), we can infer that if the condition (the alien visited Mars) is true, then the consequence (the robot visited Jupiter) must also be true. However, we know from the second statement that the consequence is false (the robot did not visit Jupiter). Therefore, the condition must also be false.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars.",
