            "content": " Explanation: The statement presents a conditional claim: \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This means that the color of the apple being red is a sufficient condition for the banana being yellow. However, the statement also includes the negation of the consequent: \"it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\" This means that the condition for the banana being yellow did not hold. Since the color of the apple being red is the only condition given for the banana being yellow, and we know that the banana was not necessarily yellow, we can infer that the sufficient condition (the apple being red) did not occur.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
