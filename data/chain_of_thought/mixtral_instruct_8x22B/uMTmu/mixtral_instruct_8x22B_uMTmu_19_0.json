            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements: 1) If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball, and 2) It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. The second statement contradicts the consequence of the first statement. If the consequence of the first statement is false (Jen did not watch basketball), then the condition of the first statement must also be false (Tom did not watch football). This is based on the logical principle of modus tollens, which states that if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P is also false.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
