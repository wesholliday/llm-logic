It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if the car was not red, then the truck does not have to be blue. However, the second statement tells us that regardless of the car's color, the truck is not necessarily blue. This means that the condition for the truck being blue (i.e., the car being red) is not met. Therefore, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
