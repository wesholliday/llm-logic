            "content": " Explanation: The statement presents a conditional logic where if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. However, it also states that it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This creates a contradiction. If the condition that Sue must be at the wedding if Mary is there is true, then it cannot also be true that Sue does not have to be at the wedding. Since the information is contradictory, we cannot make a definitive inference about whether Mary was at the wedding or not.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding.",
