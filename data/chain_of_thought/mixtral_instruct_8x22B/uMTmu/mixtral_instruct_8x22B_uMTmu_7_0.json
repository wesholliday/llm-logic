            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements: (1) If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race; and (2) It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race. From statement (2), we can infer that Chris did not finish the race. Since statement (1) tells us that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race, and we know that Chris did not finish the race, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race either. This is because the only way for statement (1) to be true is if both Alex and Chris finished the race, but since Chris did not finish the race, it must be the case that Alex did not finish the race either.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
