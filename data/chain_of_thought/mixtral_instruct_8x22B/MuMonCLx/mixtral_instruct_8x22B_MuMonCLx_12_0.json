If we remove 'gribble frazzle' from the statement, we are left with 'The wibble must be quork by fizzle', which implies that only 'fizzle' is necessary for the 'wibble' to be 'quork'. This is not a valid inference from the original statement, as it omits the necessary condition of 'gribble frazzle'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
