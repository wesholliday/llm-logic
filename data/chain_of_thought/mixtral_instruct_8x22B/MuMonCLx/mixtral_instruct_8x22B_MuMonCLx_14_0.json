            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The zooble must be zibber for a blimple and wump' implies that the condition of the zooble being zibber is necessary for both a blimple and a wump. This means that if the zooble is not zibber, neither a blimple nor a wump can occur. Conversely, if the zooble is zibber, it allows for the possibility of both a blimple and a wump. Therefore, if we remove the condition for the wump, the statement 'The zooble must be zibber for a blimple' still holds true because the zooble being zibber is a necessary condition for a blimple, regardless of the presence or absence of a wump.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
