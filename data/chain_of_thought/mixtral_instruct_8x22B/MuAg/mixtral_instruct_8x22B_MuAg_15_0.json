            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"The password must have been eight characters long and it must have included a number\" is a conjunction of two conditions that the password must meet. The first condition is that the password must be eight characters long, and the second condition is that it must include a number. When we say \"The password must have been eight characters long and included a number,\" we are also stating a conjunction of the same two conditions.
