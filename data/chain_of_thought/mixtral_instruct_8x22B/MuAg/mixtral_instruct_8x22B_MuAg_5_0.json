            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"The package must have been delivered today and it must have been signed for\" is a conjunction of two separate conditions: 1) the package must have been delivered today, and 2) it must have been signed for. The use of \"and\" indicates that both conditions must be true for the statement to be true. When we infer \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for,\" we are simply restating the original statement in a more concise way, without changing its meaning or the conditions that must be met. Therefore, the inference is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
