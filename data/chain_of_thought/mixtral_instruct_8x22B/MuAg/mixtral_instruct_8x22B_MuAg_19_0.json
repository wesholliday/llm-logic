            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The application must have been completed online and it must have included references' is a conjunction of two conditions that must be met for the application to be valid. The first condition is that the application must have been completed online, and the second condition is that it must have included references. The use of the conjunction 'and' indicates that both conditions must be true simultaneously. Therefore, we can infer that 'The application must have been completed online and included references' because this statement also indicates that both conditions must be met.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
