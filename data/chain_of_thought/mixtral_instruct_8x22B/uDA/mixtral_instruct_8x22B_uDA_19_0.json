            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (Tom watched football) is true, then the conclusion (Jen watched basketball) is also true. However, if the condition is not true (Tom did not watch football), then the conditional statement does not tell us anything about the conclusion. In other words, we cannot infer that Jen did not watch basketball based solely on the fact that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: No.",
