However, the condition (the car being red) is not met because \"the car was not red.\" Therefore, we cannot make any inference about the color of the truck based on the given information. The statement only tells us about the color of the truck if the car is red, but since the car is not red, the statement does not apply.\n\nAnswer: No.",
