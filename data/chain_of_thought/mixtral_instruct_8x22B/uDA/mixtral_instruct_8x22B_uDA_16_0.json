The shirt was not cotton.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the condition for the first statement (the shirt being cotton) is not met. Therefore, we cannot make any inference about the material of the pants based on the first statement alone. The first statement only tells us about the relationship between the materials of the shirt and pants when the shirt is cotton, which is not the case here.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the pants were not denim based on the given information.",
