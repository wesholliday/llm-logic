The book was not written by James.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if a certain condition (the book being written by James) is met, then the book is a mystery novel. However, the second statement tells us that this condition is not met (the book was not written by James).\n\nSince the condition for the book being a mystery novel is not met, we cannot infer that the book is a mystery novel. In fact, based on the information given, we can only say that the book is not a mystery novel written by James. We do not have enough information to determine the genre of the book if it was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the book is not a mystery novel.",
