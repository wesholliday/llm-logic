The dog was not inside.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if the dog is not inside, then we cannot determine the location of the cat. This is because the first statement only tells us about the cat's location when the dog is inside, not when the dog is not inside.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that the cat was not outside. The cat could be inside, outside, or anywhere else. The second statement only tells us about the dog's location, not the cat's.\n\nAnswer: No.",
