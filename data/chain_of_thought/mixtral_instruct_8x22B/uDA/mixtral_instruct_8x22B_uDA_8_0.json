This is a conditional statement, where the awakeness of the vampire is the condition for the awakeness of the mummy.\n2. The vampire was not awake. This is a direct statement about the state of the vampire.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the condition for the mummy to be awake (the vampire being awake) is not met. However, this does not necessarily mean that the mummy was not awake. The mummy could have been awake for reasons unrelated to the vampire's state.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively say that the mummy was not awake.\n\nAnswer: No.",
