The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Alex finished the race) is true, then the conclusion (Chris finished the race) is also true. However, since we know that Alex did not finish the race, the condition of the first statement is not met. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about whether Chris finished the race or not based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
