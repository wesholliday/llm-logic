The condition is \"Sam took a plane,\" and the conclusion is \"Erin took a train.\" In this case, we are given that the condition is false, as \"Sam did not take a plane.\" In logic, when the condition of a conditional statement is false, the statement as a whole is considered true, regardless of whether the conclusion is true or false. This is known as a vacuous truth. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about whether Erin took a train based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: No",
