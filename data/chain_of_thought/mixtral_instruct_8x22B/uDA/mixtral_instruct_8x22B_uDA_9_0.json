However, the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is not met because Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about Mark buying the blue shirt based on this information alone. The statement does not provide any information about what Mark would do if Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: No",
