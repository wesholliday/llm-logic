            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" is a conditional statement. It means that if the condition (the griffin being in the forest) is true, then the conclusion (the unicorn being in the forest) is also true. However, if the condition is not true (the griffin is not in the forest), the statement does not tell us anything about the location of the unicorn. Therefore, we cannot infer that the unicorn was not in the forest based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: No.",
