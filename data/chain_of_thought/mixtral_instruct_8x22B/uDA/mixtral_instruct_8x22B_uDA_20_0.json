However, the condition (the apple being red) is not met, as stated by \"the apple was not red.\" Therefore, we cannot make any inference about the color of the banana based on this information. The color of the banana is not dependent on the color of the apple in this case, as the condition for the banana being yellow (the apple being red) is not satisfied.\n\nAnswer: No.",
