However, we are also given that Joe did not go to the park, which means the hypothesis of the conditional statement is false. In a conditional statement, if the hypothesis is false, then the statement as a whole is considered true, regardless of whether the conclusion is true or false. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about Lucy's actions based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
