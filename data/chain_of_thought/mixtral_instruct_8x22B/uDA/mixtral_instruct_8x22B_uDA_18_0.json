            "content": " Explanation: We have two statements here. The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be written as \"If P then Q,\" where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal.\" The second statement is \"the doll was not plastic,\" which is the negation of P.\n\nIn logic, the negation of a conditional statement \"If P then Q\" is not the same as \"If not P then not Q.\" Instead, the negation of \"If P then Q\" is \"P and not Q.\"\n\nSince we know that P is not true (the doll was not plastic), the original conditional statement \"If P then Q\" becomes irrelevant to our inquiry. The statement \"P and not Q\" is also not applicable here because we don't know if Q (the truck was metal) is true or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the truck was not metal.\n\nAnswer: No",
