It means that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the conclusion (Sue being at the wedding) is also true. However, if the condition is not true (Mary was not at the wedding), the statement does not tell us anything about the conclusion. Therefore, we cannot infer that Sue was not at the wedding based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: No",
