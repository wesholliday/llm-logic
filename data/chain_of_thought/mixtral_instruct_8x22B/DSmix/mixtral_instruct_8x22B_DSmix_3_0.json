            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked\" is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement \"The splat might not be quanked\" introduces the possibility that the splat is not quanked, but it does not confirm it. However, if the splat is not quanked, then the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that the splat is morphed. Therefore, if we accept that the splat might not be quanked, then we can infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
