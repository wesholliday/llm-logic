However, it does not provide any information about the state of the snarp itself. The additional condition \"and the snarp is flooping\" introduces a new variable that was not present in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that the fribble is flugged under this new condition without additional information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
