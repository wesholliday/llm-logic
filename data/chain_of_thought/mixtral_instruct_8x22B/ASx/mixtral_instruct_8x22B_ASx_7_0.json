            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the tizzer is on, then the goom is snurpled\" is a simple conditional statement. It tells us that whenever the tizzer is on, the goom is snurpled. However, it does not provide any information about the plink light. The new statement \"If the tizzer is on and the plink light is out, then the goom is snurpled\" adds an additional condition (the plink light is out) to the original statement. Since the original statement does not provide any information about the plink light, we cannot infer the new statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
