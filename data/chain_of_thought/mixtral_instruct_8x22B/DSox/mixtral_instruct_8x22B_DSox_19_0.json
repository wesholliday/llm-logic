Either the smonk is vreebled or it is plagged.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the smonk cannot be plagged. The second statement is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions (vreebled or plagged) must be true. Since we know from the first statement that the smonk is not plagged, the only remaining possibility is that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
