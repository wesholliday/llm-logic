            "content": " Explanation: This is a classic example of logical reasoning using the concept of disjunction (OR) and negation (NOT).\n\nFrom the first statement, 'The splat is not quanked', we know that the splat does not have the property of being quanked.\n\nThe second statement, 'Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked', is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. Since we know from the first statement that the splat is not quanked, the only remaining possibility is that the splat is morphed.\n\nThis is a form of logical reasoning known as disjunctive syllogism, where if we have a disjunction (A or B) and we know that one of the disjuncts (A) is false, then we can infer that the other disjunct (B) must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
