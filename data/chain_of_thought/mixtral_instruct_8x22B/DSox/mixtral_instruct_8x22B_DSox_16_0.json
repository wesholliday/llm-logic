The first statement tells us that the sneg is not sproted. The second statement is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. Since we know that the sneg is not sproted, the only remaining possibility is that the sneg is crampled. Therefore, we can infer that 'The sneg is crampled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
