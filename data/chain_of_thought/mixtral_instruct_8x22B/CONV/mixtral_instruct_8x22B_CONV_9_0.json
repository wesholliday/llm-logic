            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement that describes a one-way relationship between two events. It states that if the first event (Lisa buying the red shirt) occurs, then the second event (Mark buying the blue shirt) will definitely occur. However, this statement does not tell us anything about what happens if the second event occurs first or independently of the first event. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: No.",
