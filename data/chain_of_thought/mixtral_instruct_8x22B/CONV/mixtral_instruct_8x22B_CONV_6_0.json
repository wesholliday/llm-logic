However, this statement does not necessarily imply that the reverse is true. In other words, just because Sue choosing pizza implies that Bob chose pasta, it does not mean that Bob choosing pasta implies that Sue chose pizza. It's possible that Bob could have chosen pasta regardless of what Sue chose.\n\nAnswer: No.",
