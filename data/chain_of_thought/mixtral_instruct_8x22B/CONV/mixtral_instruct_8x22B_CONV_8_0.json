However, this statement does not provide enough information to infer the converse statement \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake\". The original statement only tells us that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake, but it does not tell us anything about what happens when the mummy is awake. The mummy could be awake without the vampire being awake.\n\nAnswer: No.",
