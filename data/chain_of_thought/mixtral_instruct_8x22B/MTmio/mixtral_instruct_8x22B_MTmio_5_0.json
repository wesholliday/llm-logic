            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'Amy might not have played tennis' implies that there is a possibility that Amy did not play tennis. The second statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis' is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Jeff played basketball) is true, then the second part (Amy played tennis) must also be true. However, since we know that Amy might not have played tennis, it suggests that the condition for Jeff playing basketball was not met. Therefore, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
