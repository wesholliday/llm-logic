            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The banana might not have been yellow' suggests that there is a possibility that the banana was not yellow. On the other hand, the statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow' is a conditional statement that says if the antecedent (the apple was red) is true, then the consequent (the banana must have been yellow) must also be true. However, since we know that the banana might not have been yellow, it implies that the antecedent (the apple was red) cannot be true, because if it were, then the banana would have to be yellow, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that 'The apple was not red'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
