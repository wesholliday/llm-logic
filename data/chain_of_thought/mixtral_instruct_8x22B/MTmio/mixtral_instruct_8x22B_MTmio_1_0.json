            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'Sue might not have been at the wedding' suggests that Sue's presence at the wedding is uncertain. The second statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding' is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true. However, this does not necessarily mean that Mary was not at the wedding. It only means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there too. But since we know that Sue might not have been at the wedding, it suggests that Mary might not have been at the wedding either, because if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there too, which contradicts the uncertainty of Sue's presence. Therefore, the most we can infer is that it is uncertain whether Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'Mary was not at the wedding'.",
