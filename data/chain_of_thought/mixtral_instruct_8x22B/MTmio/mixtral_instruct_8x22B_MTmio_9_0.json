            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'Mark might not have bought the blue shirt' implies that there is a possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. However, the second statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement that establishes a necessary condition: if the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the consequent (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\nNow, if we were to infer that 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt', we would be assuming that the consequent (Mark bought the blue shirt) is false, which would imply that the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt) is also false, according to the conditional statement. However, the first statement only suggests a possibility, not a certainty, that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt based solely on these statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
