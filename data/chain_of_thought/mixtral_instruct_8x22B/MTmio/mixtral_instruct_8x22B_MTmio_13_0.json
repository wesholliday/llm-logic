            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The truck might not have been blue' implies that there is a possibility that the truck was not blue. On the other hand, the statement 'If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue' is a conditional statement that says if the antecedent (the car was red) is true, then the consequent (the truck must have been blue) must also be true. However, since we know that the truck might not have been blue, it means that the antecedent (the car was red) cannot be true because if it were, then the consequent (the truck must have been blue) would also have to be true, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that 'The car was not red'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
