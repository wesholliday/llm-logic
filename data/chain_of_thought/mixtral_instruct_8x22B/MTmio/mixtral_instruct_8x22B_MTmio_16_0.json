            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements:\n1. \"The pants might not have been denim\" - This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the pants were not made of denim.\n2. \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\" - This is a conditional statement, where the condition is that the shirt is cotton, and the consequence is that the pants must be denim.\n\nNow, if we were to infer that \"The shirt was not cotton,\" we would be contradicting the second statement. If the shirt were not cotton, then the condition for the pants to be denim would not be met. However, this does not necessarily mean that the pants are not denim, as the first statement only suggests a possibility, not a certainty.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that \"The shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
