            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The book might not be a mystery novel' implies that there is a possibility that the book is not a mystery novel. The second statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel' is a conditional statement that tells us that all books written by James are mystery novels. However, this does not necessarily mean that all mystery novels are written by James. Combining these two statements, we can infer that if the book is not a mystery novel, then it cannot have been written by James, as all of James' books are mystery novels. Therefore, if the book might not be a mystery novel, then it is possible that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
