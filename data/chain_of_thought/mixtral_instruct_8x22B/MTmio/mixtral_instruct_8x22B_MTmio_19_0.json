            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'Jen might not have watched basketball' indicates that it is uncertain whether Jen watched basketball or not. The second statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball' is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequence (Jen watched basketball) must also be true. However, since we know that Jen might not have watched basketball, it implies that the condition (Tom watched football) cannot be true. Therefore, we can infer that 'Tom did not watch football'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
