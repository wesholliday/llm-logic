(This is a conditional statement where the vampire being awake is the sufficient condition for the mummy to be awake.)\n2. The mummy was awake. (This is a fact.)\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must be awake. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the mummy is awake, then the vampire must be awake. The mummy could be awake for reasons other than the vampire being awake.\n\nSince the second statement tells us that the mummy was indeed awake, we cannot definitively say that the vampire was awake based solely on the information given. The mummy could have been awake due to other factors, not necessarily because the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: No.",
