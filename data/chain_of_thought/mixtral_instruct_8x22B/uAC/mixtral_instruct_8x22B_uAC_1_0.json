            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true. However, this does not necessarily mean that the reverse is true. In other words, just because Sue was at the wedding, we cannot automatically infer that Mary was also at the wedding. The statement only tells us that if Mary was there, then Sue was too, but it does not tell us anything about what happens if Sue is there.\n\nAnswer: No.",
