The statement \"Kate ate salad\" is given as true. However, the conditional statement only tells us that if the hypothesis is true, then the conclusion must be true. It does not tell us that if the conclusion is true, then the hypothesis must be true. Therefore, we cannot infer that Ben ate pasta just because Kate ate salad.\n\nAnswer: No.",
