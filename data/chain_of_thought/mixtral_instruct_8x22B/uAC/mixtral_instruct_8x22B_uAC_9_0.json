From statement (2), we know that Mark bought the blue shirt. However, the first statement is a conditional (\"if-then\") statement, which only tells us about the consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt) if the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true. It does not tell us that the condition is true if the consequence is true. Therefore, we cannot infer that Lisa bought the red shirt based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: No",
