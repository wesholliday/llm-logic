From statement (1), we know that Sue choosing pizza is a sufficient condition for Bob to choose pasta. However, this does not mean that Sue choosing pizza is a necessary condition for Bob to choose pasta. In other words, Bob could have chosen pasta even if Sue did not choose pizza. Therefore, we cannot infer that Sue chose pizza just because Bob chose pasta.\n\nAnswer: No.",
