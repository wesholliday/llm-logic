The statement \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is given as true. However, the truth of the conclusion does not necessarily imply the truth of the hypothesis in a conditional statement. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that Joe went to the park based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: No.",
