            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand' presents two possibilities for the location of the notebook. The statement 'The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand' eliminates one of those possibilities. Therefore, by process of elimination, we can infer that the notebook must be in the drawer. This is a logical deduction based on the principle of excluded middle, which states that a statement is either true or false with no other options.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
