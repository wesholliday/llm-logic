Either the umbrella is in the car or it is tucked away in the closet.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the umbrella is not in the closet. The second statement gives us two possibilities for the location of the umbrella: either it is in the car or it is in the closet. However, since we already know that the umbrella is not in the closet (from the first statement), the only remaining possibility is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
