            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities for the location of the remote control. The first possibility is that the remote control is on the coffee table, and the second possibility is that it is hiding under the couch. However, we are also given the information that \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\" This means that the second possibility is not true. Since there are only two possibilities and one of them has been ruled out, we can infer that the remaining possibility must be true. Therefore, the remote control must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
