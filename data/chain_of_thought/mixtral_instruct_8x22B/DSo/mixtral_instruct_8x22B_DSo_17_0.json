            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack' negates one of the two possibilities presented in the second statement 'Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it is draped on the coat rack'. Since the scarf cannot be draped on the coat rack, the only remaining possibility is that 'The scarf is stuffed in my backpack'.
