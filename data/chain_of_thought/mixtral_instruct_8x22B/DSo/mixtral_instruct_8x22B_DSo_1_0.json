            "content": " Explanation: We have two statements that can be considered as premises for our logical deduction. The first premise is 'Fido is not in the garden', which can be represented as ~G (where G stands for 'Fido is in the garden'). The second premise is 'Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden', which can be represented as I \u2228 G (where I stands for 'Fido is inside').\n\nUsing these premises, we can construct a logical argument. Since we know that Fido is not in the garden (~G), we can eliminate the possibility that Fido is in the garden from the second premise. This leaves us with the statement 'Fido is inside' (I).\n\nThis is a valid logical deduction, as we have used the process of elimination to arrive at our conclusion. By knowing that one of the two possibilities in the second premise is false (Fido is not in the garden), we can infer that the other possibility must be true (Fido is inside).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
