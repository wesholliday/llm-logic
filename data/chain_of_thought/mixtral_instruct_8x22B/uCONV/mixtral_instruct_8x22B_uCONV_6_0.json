However, this statement does not provide information about what Bob chose if Sue did not choose pizza. It is possible that Bob could have chosen pasta even if Sue did not choose pizza. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza\" based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
