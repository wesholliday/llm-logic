            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement that tells us about the relationship between Mary being at the wedding and Sue being at the wedding. Specifically, it tells us that if the hypothesis (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the conclusion (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true. However, this statement does not tell us anything about what happens when Sue is at the wedding. It is possible that Sue could be at the wedding without Mary being there. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No.",
