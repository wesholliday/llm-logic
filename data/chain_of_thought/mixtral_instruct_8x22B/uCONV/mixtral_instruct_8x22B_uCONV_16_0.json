            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. In this case, the shirt being cotton is the hypothesis, and the pants being denim is the conclusion. However, this statement does not tell us anything about what the pants are made of if the shirt is not cotton. It also does not tell us that the shirt must be cotton if the pants are denim. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"if the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton\" based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
