            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. In this case, \"the apple was red\" is the hypothesis, and \"the banana was yellow\" is the conclusion. However, this statement does not tell us anything about what happens when the banana is yellow. It only tells us that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red. This is because the banana could be yellow for reasons other than the apple being red.\n\nAnswer: No.",
