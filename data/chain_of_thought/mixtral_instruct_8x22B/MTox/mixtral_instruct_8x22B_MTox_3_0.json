If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\n\nFrom the second statement, we can infer that if a splat is morphed, it will definitely quank. However, we know from the first statement that the splat did not quank. Therefore, it must be the case that the splat was not morphed, because if it had been morphed, it would have quanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
