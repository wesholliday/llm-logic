            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"The fleeg did not surn\" tells us about the outcome, while \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" is a conditional statement that tells us about a specific condition and its outcome. In logic, this type of conditional statement is known as modus tollens, which means \"the method of denying by taking\". If the consequent (the outcome) of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent (the condition) must also be false. In this case, the consequent is \"it surned\", which is false according to the first statement. Therefore, the antecedent \"the fleeg was bluttered\" must also be false.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
