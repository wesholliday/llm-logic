            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements:\n1. The sprocket was not daggled.\n2. If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be broken down into two parts: the hypothesis (the sprocket was cranked) and the conclusion (the sprocket was daggled). The statement says that if the hypothesis is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nHowever, we are given that the conclusion is not true (the sprocket was not daggled). According to the rules of logic, if a conditional statement is true and its conclusion is false, then the hypothesis must also be false. Therefore, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
