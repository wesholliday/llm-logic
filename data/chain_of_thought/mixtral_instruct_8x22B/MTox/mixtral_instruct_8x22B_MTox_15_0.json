            "content": " Explanation: This is a logical reasoning problem that can be solved using the rules of inference. We have two statements:\n\n1. The dreb was not spened.\n2. If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be rewritten as \"The dreb was vroombed implies the dreb was spened.\"\n\nGiven that the dreb was not spened (from the first statement), and using the contrapositive of the second statement (which is logically equivalent to the original statement), we can infer that \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the rules of logical inference, we can conclude that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
