            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The fribble did not crink' is given as a fact. The second statement is a conditional 'if-then' statement, which means that if the condition (the fribble was snurgled) is true, then the consequence (the fribble crinked) must also be true. However, we know that the consequence did not happen (the fribble did not crink). Therefore, according to the rules of logic, the condition (the fribble was snurgled) must also be false. This is an example of the logical rule called modus tollens, which states that if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P is also false.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
