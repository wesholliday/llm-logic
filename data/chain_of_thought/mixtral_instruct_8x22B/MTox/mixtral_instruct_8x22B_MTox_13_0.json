If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\n\nFrom the second statement, we can infer that if the glip was not tragged, then it could not have been slogged either. This is because the second statement establishes a relationship between being slogged and being tragged, specifically that if a glip is slogged, it must also be tragged. Since we know from the first statement that the glip was not tragged, it follows that the glip could not have been slogged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
