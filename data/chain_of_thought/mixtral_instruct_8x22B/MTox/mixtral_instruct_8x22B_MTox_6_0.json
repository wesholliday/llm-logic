If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be rewritten as \"The grommet plopped the frink implies the grommet was sploffed.\" However, we are interested in the contrapositive of this statement, which is logically equivalent: \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\"\n\nGiven that the grommet did not plop the frink (from the first statement), we can apply the contrapositive of the second statement to conclude that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
