            "content": " Explanation: This is a logical reasoning problem that can be solved using the rules of formal logic. We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The wug was not garpled\" (let's call this statement A)\n2. \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" (let's call this statement B)\n\nStatement B is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. In formal logic, this is written as \"sproinged -> garpled\". The negation of a conditional statement is equivalent to the negation of the consequent (the \"then\" part) implying the negation of the antecedent (the \"if\" part). In other words, \"not (sproinged -> garpled)\" is equivalent to \"not garpled -> not sproinged\".\n\nGiven statement A, we know that \"not garpled\" is true. Therefore, according to the negation of statement B, \"not sproinged\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
