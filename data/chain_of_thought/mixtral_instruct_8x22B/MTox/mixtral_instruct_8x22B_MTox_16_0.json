            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements:\n1. The sneg did not sproted the frink.\n2. If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the sneg did not sprot the frink. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the sneg was crampled) is true, then the consequence (the sneg sproted the frink) must also be true. However, we know from the first statement that the consequence did not occur. Therefore, the condition must not have been true. In other words, the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
