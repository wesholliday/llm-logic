However, the difficulty of the exam cannot be directly inferred from this statement alone. The difficulty of an exam depends on various factors such as the complexity of the questions, the time allotted, and the student's understanding of the material. Therefore, while it is true that an exam covering all chapters might be difficult, it is not necessarily the case.\n\nAnswer: No.",
