            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been notarized\" implies that a notary public has witnessed the signing of the document and verified the identities of the parties involved. The notarization process typically involves the signer(s) appearing before the notary, presenting valid identification, and signing the document in the presence of the notary. After the signing, the notary will affix their seal and signature to the document, indicating that the notarization process has been completed. Therefore, if a document has been notarized, it is reasonable to infer that it has also been signed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
