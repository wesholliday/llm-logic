            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement, also known as a material implication. In this case, 'Mary was at the wedding' is the hypothesis, and 'Sue was at the wedding' is the conclusion. However, just because the conclusion is true (Sue was at the wedding), we cannot infer that the hypothesis is true (Mary was at the wedding). This is because the conditional statement does not imply that Sue's presence at the wedding is exclusively dependent on Mary's presence. There could be other reasons why Sue was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No.",
