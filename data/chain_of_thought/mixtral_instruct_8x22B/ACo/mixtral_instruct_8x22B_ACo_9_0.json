            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement, also known as a material implication. This means that if the first part (the antecedent, 'Lisa bought the red shirt') is true, then the second part (the consequent, 'Mark bought the blue shirt') must also be true. However, this does not mean that if the consequent is true, the antecedent must also be true. In other words, just because Mark bought the blue shirt, we cannot infer that Lisa bought the red shirt. The statement 'Mark bought the blue shirt' could be true for many reasons, not just because Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: No.",
