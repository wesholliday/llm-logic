            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den' is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (the bear being in the cave) is true, then the conclusion (the wolf being in the den) is also true. However, this does not mean that the reverse is true. In other words, just because the wolf is in the den, we cannot infer that the bear is in the cave. The wolf could be in the den for a different reason, and the bear could be somewhere else entirely.\n\nAnswer: No.",
