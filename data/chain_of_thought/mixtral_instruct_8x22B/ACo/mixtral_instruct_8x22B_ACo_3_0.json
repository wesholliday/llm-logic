            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"The book is a mystery novel\" is true, and the statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is also true. However, these statements do not provide enough information to infer that \"The book was written by James\". The fact that the book is a mystery novel does not imply that it was written by James, as there are many mystery novels written by different authors. The second statement only tells us that if James wrote the book, then it would be a mystery novel, but it does not tell us that James is the only author who could have written a mystery novel. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The book was written by James\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
