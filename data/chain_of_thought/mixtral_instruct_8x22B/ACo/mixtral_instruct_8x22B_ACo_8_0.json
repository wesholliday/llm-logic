            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is a conditional statement, also known as a material implication. This means that if the condition (the vampire being awake) is true, then the consequence (the mummy being awake) must also be true. However, this does not necessarily mean that the converse is true. In other words, just because the mummy is awake, we cannot automatically infer that the vampire is also awake. The mummy could be awake for a different reason, not necessarily because the vampire is awake.\n\nAnswer: No.",
