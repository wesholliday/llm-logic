            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' is a conditional statement, also known as a material implication. In this case, 'the apple was red' is the hypothesis or antecedent, and 'the banana was yellow' is the conclusion or consequent. The statement tells us that if the hypothesis is true, then the conclusion must also be true. However, it does not tell us anything about the truth of the hypothesis when the conclusion is true. In other words, just because the banana was yellow, we cannot infer that the apple was red. The banana could have been yellow regardless of the color of the apple.\n\nAnswer: No.",
