            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim' is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. In this case, 'the shirt was cotton' is the hypothesis, and 'the pants were denim' is the conclusion. The statement 'The pants were denim' is given as true, but this only tells us about the conclusion of the conditional statement, not the hypothesis. The fact that the pants are denim does not necessarily mean that the shirt is cotton. The shirt could be made of any material, and the pants would still be denim. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The shirt was cotton' based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
