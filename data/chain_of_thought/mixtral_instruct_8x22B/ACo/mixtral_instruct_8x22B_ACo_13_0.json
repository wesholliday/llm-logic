            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The truck was blue' is a fact given to us. The statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' is a conditional statement, also known as a sufficient condition. This means that if the car is red, then the truck being blue is guaranteed. However, this does not mean that the car being red is the only way for the truck to be blue. The truck could be blue for other reasons as well. Therefore, from the fact that the truck is blue, we cannot infer that the car is red.\n\nAnswer: No.",
