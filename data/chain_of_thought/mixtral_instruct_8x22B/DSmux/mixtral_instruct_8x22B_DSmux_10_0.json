            "content": " Explanation: This problem can be solved using logical reasoning and the rules of inference. The statement 'Either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled' is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement 'It's not the case that the wug must be garpled' is the negation of one of the conditions in the disjunction. By applying the rule of disjunctive syllogism, which states that if P or Q is true and P is false, then Q is true, we can infer that the remaining condition in the disjunction must be true. Therefore, if it's not the case that the wug must be garpled, then the wug must be sproinged.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
