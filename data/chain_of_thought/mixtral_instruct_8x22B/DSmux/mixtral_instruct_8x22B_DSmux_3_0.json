            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked' is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement 'It's not the case that the splat must be quanked' is a negation of one of the conditions in the disjunction. Since the disjunction requires at least one condition to be true, and we know that the splat not being quanked is true, we can infer that the other condition, 'the splat is morphed', must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
