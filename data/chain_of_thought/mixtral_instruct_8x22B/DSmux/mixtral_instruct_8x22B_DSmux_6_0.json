            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped\" is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped\" is a negation of one of the conditions in the disjunction. Since the disjunction requires at least one condition to be true, and we know that the condition \"it must be plopped\" is false, we can infer that the other condition \"the grommet is sploffed\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
