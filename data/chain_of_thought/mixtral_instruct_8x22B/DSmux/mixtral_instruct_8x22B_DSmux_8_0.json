            "content": " Explanation: This problem can be solved using logical reasoning and the rules of inference. We have two statements:\n\n1. Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled (P or Q).\n2. It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled (not Q).\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that either P is true or Q is true. From the second statement, we know that Q is not true. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that P is true.\n\nThis is an application of the logical rule of inference called \"disjunctive syllogism,\" which states that if we have a disjunction (P or Q) and we know that one of the disjuncts (Q) is false, then the other disjunct (P) must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
