The truth of a conditional statement does not imply the truth of its converse. In other words, just because Lucy went to the zoo does not necessarily mean that Joe went to the park. It's possible that Lucy went to the zoo for reasons unrelated to Joe's actions. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Joe went to the park based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: No.",
