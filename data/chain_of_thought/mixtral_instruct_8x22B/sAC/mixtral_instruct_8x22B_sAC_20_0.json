            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. In this case, \"If the apple was red\" is the hypothesis, and \"then the banana was yellow\" is the conclusion. The statement is true if whenever the hypothesis is true, the conclusion is also true. However, this does not mean that the hypothesis is true whenever the conclusion is true. In other words, just because the banana was yellow, we cannot conclude that the apple was red. The banana could have been yellow for a different reason.\n\nAnswer: No.",
