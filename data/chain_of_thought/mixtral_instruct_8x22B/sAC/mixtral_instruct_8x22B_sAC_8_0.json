            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is a conditional statement, also known as a material implication. In this case, the vampire being awake is the hypothesis (or antecedent), and the mummy being awake is the conclusion (or consequent). However, the truth of the conditional statement does not imply the truth of its hypothesis. In other words, just because the mummy was awake does not necessarily mean that the vampire was awake. The conditional statement only tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake, but it does not tell us anything about what happens when the mummy is awake.\n\nAnswer: No.",
