            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement, also known as a material implication. The truth of a conditional statement does not imply the truth of its converse. In other words, just because Sue was at the wedding does not necessarily mean that Mary was at the wedding. The statement only tells us that if Mary was there, then Sue was also there. It does not tell us anything about whether Mary was there if Sue was there. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Mary was at the wedding based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: No.",
