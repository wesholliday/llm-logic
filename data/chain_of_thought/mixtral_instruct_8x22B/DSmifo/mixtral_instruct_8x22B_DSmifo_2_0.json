            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The book might not be resting on the table' implies that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. The second statement 'Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf' is a disjunction, which means that one or both of the statements it connects must be true. Since we know from the first statement that the book might not be on the table, the only other possibility given by the second statement is that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, we can infer that 'The book is on the shelf'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
