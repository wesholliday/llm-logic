            "content": " Explanation: The growth of plants is dependent on multiple factors, including water, sunlight, nutrients, and suitable temperature. While watering the plants is essential for their growth, it is not the only requirement. Sunlight is crucial for photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy to fuel their growth. Without sunlight, plants would not be able to produce the energy they need to grow, even if they are watered regularly. Therefore, we cannot infer that plants will grow if they are watered but not exposed to sunlight.\n\nAnswer: No.",
