            "content": " Explanation: While it's true that fertilizing the lawn can promote growth and a healthy green color, this is under the assumption that other necessary conditions for plant growth are met. One of these conditions is adequate water. During a drought, there is a significant lack of water, which is a crucial element for plant growth and health. Therefore, even if the lawn is fertilized, the lack of water during a drought can prevent the lawn from becoming lush and green.\n\nAnswer: No.",
