However, this statement does not provide information about other conditions that may affect the shipping of the item, such as the availability of the item. If the item is out of stock, it means that the item is not available and cannot be shipped. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the order is placed and the item is out of stock, then it will ship.\n\nAnswer: No.",
