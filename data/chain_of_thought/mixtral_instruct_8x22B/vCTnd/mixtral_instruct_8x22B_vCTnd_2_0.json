The original statement is \"If Ann exercised, then she did not exercise strenuously.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise.\" Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
