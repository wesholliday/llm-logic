            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a contrapositive, which is a logically valid form of argument. The original statement is \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice,\" which can be rewritten as \"If advice was offered, then it was not helpful advice.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered.\" The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
