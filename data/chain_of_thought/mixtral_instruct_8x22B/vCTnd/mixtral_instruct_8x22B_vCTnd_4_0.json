            "content": " Explanation: The argument can be analyzed using logical principles. The premise is a conditional statement that can be written as \"If P, then not Q\", where P is \"Ben studied\" and Q is \"Ben studied diligently\". The conclusion is another conditional statement that can be written as \"If Q, then not P\". This form of argument is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
