            "content": " Explanation: This argument is a form of logical reasoning known as contrapositive. The original statement is \"If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given.\" In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa. Therefore, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
