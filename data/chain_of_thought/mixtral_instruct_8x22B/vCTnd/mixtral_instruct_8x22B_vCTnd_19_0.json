            "content": " Explanation: This argument is a form of logical reasoning known as contrapositive reasoning. The original statement is \"If directions were provided, then they were not explained clearly.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided.\" In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa. Therefore, if the premise of the argument is true, then the conclusion must also be true. This means that the form of the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
