            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical operation called transposition or contrapositive. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. That is, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nThe original statement is \"If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables,\" which can be symbolized as \"P -> ~Q,\" where P is \"I went to the store\" and Q is \"I bought vegetables.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store,\" which can be symbolized as \"Q -> ~P.\"\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, if it is true that \"If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables,\" then it must also be true that \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
