            "content": " Explanation: This argument is presented in a form of logical reasoning known as contrapositive. The original statement is \"If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly,\" which can be symbolized as \"If P, then not Q.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If Q, then not P,\" which is \"If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed.\"\n\nIn logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if the premise \"If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly\" is true, then the conclusion \"If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed\" is also true.\n\nHowever, the logical validity of an argument depends on whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, not on the truth of the premises themselves. In this case, the conclusion does follow necessarily from the premise, because the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid.",
