            "content": " Explanation: This argument is a form of logical reasoning known as a contrapositive argument. The original statement is \"If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal,\" which can be rewritten as \"If P, then not Q,\" where P is \"I ate a meal\" and Q is \"I ate a large meal.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If Q, then not P,\" which is equivalent to \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal.\"\n\nIn logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if the premise \"If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal\" is true, then the conclusion \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal\" is also true.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the truth of the premise is not guaranteed, and the argument only establishes the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion. If the premise is false, then the argument does not hold.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid.",
