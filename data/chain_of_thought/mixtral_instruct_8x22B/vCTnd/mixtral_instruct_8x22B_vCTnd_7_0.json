            "content": " Explanation: The argument is in the form of a contrapositive, which is a logically equivalent form of the original statement. The original statement is \"If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served.\"\n\nIn logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa. Therefore, if the premise of the argument is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the truth of the premise is not established in this argument. The argument only states that if the customer was served, then he was not served promptly. It does not provide any evidence to support this claim. Therefore, while the form of the argument is logically valid, the truth of the argument depends on the truth of its premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes, the form of the argument is logically valid.",
