            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument that follows the form of modus ponens, which is a valid argument form. Modus ponens states that if P is true, and \"if P then Q\" is true, then we can infer that Q is true. In this case, P is \"The sprocket was cranked\" and Q is \"The sprocket was daggled\". Since we know that P is true (from the first statement) and \"if P then Q\" is true (from the second statement), we can infer that Q is true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The sprocket was daggled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
