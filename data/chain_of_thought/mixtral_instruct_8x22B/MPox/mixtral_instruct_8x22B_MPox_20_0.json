Modus ponens is a rule of inference that says if P is true and \"if P, then Q\" is true, then we can infer that Q is true. In this case, \"The fleeg was bluttered\" is P, and \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" is \"if P, then Q\". Therefore, we can infer that \"The fleeg surned\" (Q) is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
