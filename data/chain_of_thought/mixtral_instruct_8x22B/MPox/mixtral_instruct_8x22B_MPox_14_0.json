            "content": " Explanation: This question is based on a logical reasoning concept called the Law of Detachment. According to this law, if a statement of the form 'If P, then Q' is true, and the statement P is also true, then we can infer that the statement Q is true. In this case, 'The clug was fleeked' is the statement P, and 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged' is the statement 'If P, then Q'. Since both of these statements are true, we can infer that 'The clug snugged' (statement Q) is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
