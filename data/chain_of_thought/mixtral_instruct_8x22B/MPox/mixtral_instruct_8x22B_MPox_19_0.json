            "content": " Explanation: This question is based on the logical rule of inference known as modus ponens. Modus ponens states that if P is true and \"if P then Q\" is true, then we can infer that Q is true. In this case, \"The smonk was vreebled\" is P, and \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\" is \"if P then Q\". Therefore, if both of these statements are true, we can infer that \"The smonk plagged\" (Q) is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
