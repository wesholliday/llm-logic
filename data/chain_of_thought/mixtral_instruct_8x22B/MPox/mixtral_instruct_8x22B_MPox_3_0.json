            "content": " Explanation: This is a classic example of logical reasoning using a type of argument called Modus Ponens. Modus Ponens is a rule of inference that states if P is true and \"if P, then Q\" is true, then Q must also be true. In this case, \"The splat was morphed\" is P, and \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" is \"if P, then Q\". Therefore, if both of these statements are true, then we can infer that \"The splat quanked\" (Q) is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
