            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The dreb might not have been spened' implies that there is a possibility that the dreb was not spened. The second statement 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened' is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the dreb was vroombed) is true, then the consequence (the dreb must have been spened) must also be true. However, if the consequence is not true (the dreb was not spened), then the condition (the dreb was vroombed) must also be false. Therefore, if we know that the dreb might not have been spened, then we can infer that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
