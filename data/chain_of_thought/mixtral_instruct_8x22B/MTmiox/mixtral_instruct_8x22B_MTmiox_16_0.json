            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The sneg might not have sproted the frink' implies that there is a possibility that the sneg did not sprote the frink. On the other hand, the statement 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink' is a conditional statement that says if the condition (the sneg was crampled) is true, then the consequence (the sneg sproted the frink) must also be true. However, since we know that the sneg might not have sproted the frink, it implies that the condition (the sneg was crampled) might not be true. Therefore, we can infer that 'The sneg was not crampled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
