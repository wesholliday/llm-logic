            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The sprocket might not have been daggled' implies that there is a possibility that the sprocket was not daggled. The second statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled' is a conditional statement, which means that cranking the sprocket is a sufficient condition for dangling the sprocket. In other words, if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled. However, since we know that the sprocket might not have been daggled, it follows that the sprocket could not have been cranked. This is because if the sprocket had been cranked, then it must have been daggled, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
