            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"The exam might be difficult or easy\" is a disjunction, which means that it presents two possibilities: either the exam might be difficult, or the exam might be easy. In logic, a disjunction is true if at least one of the disjuncts (the parts connected by 'or') is true. Therefore, from the statement \"The exam might be difficult or easy\", we can infer that \"The exam might be difficult\" is a possibility, because it is one of the disjuncts in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
