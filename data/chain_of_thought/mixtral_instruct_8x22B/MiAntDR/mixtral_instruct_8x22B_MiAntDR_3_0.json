            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The keys might be in the drawer or on the table' is a disjunction, which means that the keys could be in either location, but not necessarily both. Therefore, it is possible that the keys might be on the table, but it is also possible that they might be in the drawer instead. The original statement does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the keys are on the table.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that 'The keys might be on the table', but it is not certain.",
