            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The flight might be delayed or on time' is a disjunction, which means that either one of the two possibilities (delayed or on time) could be true. In logic, a disjunction is true if at least one of its disjuncts (in this case, 'delayed' or 'on time') is true. Therefore, from the statement 'The flight might be delayed or on time', we can infer that 'The flight might be on time' because this is one of the possibilities included in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
