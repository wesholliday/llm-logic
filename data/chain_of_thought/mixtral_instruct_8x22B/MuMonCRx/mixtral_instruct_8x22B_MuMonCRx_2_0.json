            "content": " Explanation: The sentence 'The quorple must be on the plonk and gribble a grazzle froodle' suggests that there are two actions that the quorple must do: being on the plonk and gribbling a grazzle froodle. However, the original sentence does not imply that these two actions are dependent on each other. Therefore, we cannot infer that the quorple must be gribbling a grazzle froodle without the condition of being on the plonk.\n\nAnswer: No.",
