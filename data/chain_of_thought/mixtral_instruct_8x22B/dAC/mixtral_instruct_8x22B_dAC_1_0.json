            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement, also known as a material implication. This statement tells us that if the hypothesis (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the conclusion (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true. However, this statement does not tell us anything about what happens when the conclusion is true. In other words, just because Sue was at the wedding, we cannot deduce that Mary was also at the wedding. This is a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent.\n\nAnswer: No.",
