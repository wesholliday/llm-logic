            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. In this case, \"the apple was red\" is the hypothesis, and \"the banana was yellow\" is the conclusion. However, just because the conclusion is true (the banana was yellow), we cannot automatically deduce that the hypothesis is true (the apple was red). This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The color of the banana does not affect the color of the apple. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that the apple was red based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: No.",
