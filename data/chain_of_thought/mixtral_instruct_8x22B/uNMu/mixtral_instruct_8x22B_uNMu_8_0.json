In other words, it is not a necessary condition for the situation being discussed. This leaves open the possibility that the vampire might not have been awake. However, it does not confirm that the vampire was indeed not awake, as the vampire could still have been awake; it just wasn't a certainty or a necessity.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
