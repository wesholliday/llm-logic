            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars\" implies that the alien's visit to Mars is not a certainty. In other words, it is not a necessary condition that the alien has visited Mars. This leaves open the possibility that the alien might not have visited Mars. However, it does not confirm that the alien did not visit Mars, as the alien could have visited Mars without it being a necessary condition.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that the alien might not have visited Mars.",
