            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag\" implies that the presence of the sunglasses in the bag is not a certainty. This means that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not in the bag. In logic, if it is not necessarily true that something is the case, then it is possible that the opposite is true.
