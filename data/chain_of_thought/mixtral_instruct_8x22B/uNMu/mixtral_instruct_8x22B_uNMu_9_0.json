            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" implies that Lisa's purchase of the red shirt is not a certainty. In other words, there is no necessity for Lisa to have bought the red shirt. This leaves open the possibility that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt. However, it does not confirm that she did not buy it, as she still could have bought it. The statement only indicates that the purchase was not mandatory or guaranteed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
