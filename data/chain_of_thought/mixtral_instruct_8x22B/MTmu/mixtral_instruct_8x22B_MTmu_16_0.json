            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\" is a conditional statement, where the condition is \"the shirt was cotton\" and the conclusion is \"the pants must have been denim\". The second statement \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim\" is the negation of the conclusion of the conditional statement. In logic, if a conditional statement is true and its conclusion is false, then the condition must also be false. Therefore, if it's not the case that the pants must have been denim, then it must be false that the shirt was cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
