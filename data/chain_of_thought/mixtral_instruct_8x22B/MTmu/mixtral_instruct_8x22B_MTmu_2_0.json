            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements:\n1. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest. This can be written as a conditional statement: Griffin in forest -> Unicorn in forest.\n2. It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest. This negates the consequent of the conditional statement, which can be written as: ~(Unicorn in forest).\n\nFrom these two statements, we can use the rule of inference called modus tollens, which states that if P -> Q and ~Q, then ~P. In this case, P is \"Griffin in forest\" and Q is \"Unicorn in forest\". Therefore, we can infer that ~P, which is \"The griffin was not in the forest\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
