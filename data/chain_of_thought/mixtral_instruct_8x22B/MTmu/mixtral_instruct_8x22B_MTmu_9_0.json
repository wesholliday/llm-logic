            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement, where 'Lisa bought the red shirt' is the hypothesis and 'Mark must have bought the blue shirt' is the conclusion. The second statement 'It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt' negates the conclusion of the conditional statement. In logic, if the conclusion of a conditional statement is false, then the hypothesis must also be false. Therefore, if it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt, then it must not be the case that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
