            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements:\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. (This is a conditional statement, where Joe going to the park is the hypothesis and Lucy going to the zoo is the conclusion.)\n2. It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. (This negates the conclusion of the conditional statement.)\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the hypothesis of the conditional statement (Joe going to the park) must be false because the conclusion (Lucy going to the zoo) is not necessarily true. If the hypothesis were true, then the conclusion would also have to be true, according to the conditional statement. However, since the conclusion is not necessarily true, the hypothesis must be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
