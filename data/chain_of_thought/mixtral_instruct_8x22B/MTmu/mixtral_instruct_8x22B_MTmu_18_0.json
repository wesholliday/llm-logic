            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" is a conditional statement, where the first clause (the doll was plastic) is the hypothesis, and the second clause (the truck must have been metal) is the conclusion. The statement \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\" is the negation of the conclusion of the conditional statement.\n\nIn logic, when the conclusion of a conditional statement is false, the hypothesis can either be true or false. Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot definitively infer that \"The doll was not plastic\". It is possible that the doll was plastic, but the truck was not metal, which would still be consistent with the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
