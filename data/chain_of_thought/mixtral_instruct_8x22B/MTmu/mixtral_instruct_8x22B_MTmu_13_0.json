            "content": " Explanation: We have two statements here. The first statement is a conditional statement, \"If P then Q,\" where P is \"The car was red\" and Q is \"The truck must have been blue.\" The second statement is the negation of the consequent of the conditional statement, which is \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\" This can be written as \"Not Q.\"\n\nIn logic, if a conditional statement \"If P then Q\" is true, and the consequent \"Q\" is false, then the antecedent \"P\" must also be false. This is known as the principle of contrapositive. In this case, if \"The truck must have been blue\" (Q) is false, and the conditional statement \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\" is true, then \"The car was red\" (P) must be false.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that \"The car was not red.\"",
