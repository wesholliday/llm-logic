            "content": " Explanation: We have two statements here. The first statement is a conditional statement, \"If P then Q\", where P is \"The cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"The muffins must have been blueberry\". The second statement is the negation of the consequent of the conditional statement, which is \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry\", or in logical terms, \"not Q\".\n\nIn logic, if a statement \"If P then Q\" is true, and the consequent \"Q\" is false, then the antecedent \"P\" must also be false. This is known as the principle of contrapositive, which states that \"If P then Q\" is logically equivalent to \"If not Q then not P\".\n\nTherefore, if it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry (not Q), and we know that if the cake was chocolate then the muffins must have been blueberry (If P then Q), then we can infer that the cake was not chocolate (not P).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
