            "content": " Explanation: We have two statements here that can be treated as logical propositions. The first statement is a conditional proposition, which can be written as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"The apple was red\" and Q is \"The banana was yellow\". The second statement is the negation of the consequent of the conditional proposition, which can be written as \"Not Q\".\n\nIn logic, the negation of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is not \"If not P, then not Q\", but rather \"P and not Q\". However, the statement \"Not Q\" does not directly negate the entire conditional statement, but only its consequent. Therefore, we cannot directly infer the negation of the antecedent (P) from the negation of the consequent (Q).\n\nHowever, if we know that \"Not Q\" is true, then we can infer that the original conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is false, because a conditional statement is false when its hypothesis (P) is true and its conclusion (Q) is false. But this still does not allow us to infer the truth or falsity of the antecedent (P) directly.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot infer that \"The apple was not red\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
