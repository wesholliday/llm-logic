            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements:\n1. If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n2. It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if Tom did not watch football, then it is not necessarily true that Jen watched basketball. However, this does not tell us anything about what happens if Tom did watch football.\n\nThe second statement tells us that it is not necessarily true that Jen watched basketball. This means that the condition for Jen watching basketball (Tom watching football) did not occur.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Tom did not watch football, because if he had, then Jen must have watched basketball, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
