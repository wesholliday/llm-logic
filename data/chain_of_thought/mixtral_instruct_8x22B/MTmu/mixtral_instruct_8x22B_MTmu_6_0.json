The statement \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta\" is the negation of the conclusion of the conditional statement. In logic, if the conclusion of a conditional statement is false, then the hypothesis can be either true or false. Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot definitively infer that \"Sue did not choose pizza\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
