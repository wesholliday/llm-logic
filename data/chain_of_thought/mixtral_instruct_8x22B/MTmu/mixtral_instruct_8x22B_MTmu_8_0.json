            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake\" is a conditional statement, where the vampire being awake is the hypothesis and the mummy being awake is the conclusion. The statement \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake\" is the negation of the conclusion of the conditional statement. In logic, if the conclusion of a conditional statement is false, then the hypothesis must also be false. Therefore, if it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake, then the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
