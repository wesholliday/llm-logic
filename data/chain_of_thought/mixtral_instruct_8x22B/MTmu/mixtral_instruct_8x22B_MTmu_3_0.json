            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\" is a conditional statement, where \"the book was written by James\" is the hypothesis and \"the book must be a mystery novel\" is the conclusion. The negation of a conditional statement is a contrapositive statement, which in this case would be \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James\". However, the statement \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel\" is not the same as \"the book is not a mystery novel\". The former statement only implies that the book being a mystery novel is not a certainty, not that it is definitely not a mystery novel. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The book was not written by James\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
