            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den' is a conditional statement, where the first clause (bear in the cave) is the hypothesis, and the second clause (wolf in the den) is the conclusion. The second statement 'It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den' negates the conclusion of the conditional statement.\n\nIn logic, if a conditional statement is true and its conclusion is false, then the hypothesis must also be false. This is known as the principle of contrapositive. Therefore, if it's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den, then the hypothesis 'the bear was in the cave' must be false.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer 'The bear was not in the cave'.",
