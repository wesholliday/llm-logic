            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" is a conditional statement, where Mary being at the wedding is the sufficient condition for Sue to be at the wedding. The statement \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding\" is a negation of the consequent of the conditional statement. In logic, if the consequent of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent (Mary being at the wedding) must also be false, according to the principle of contrapositive. Therefore, if it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding, then we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
