Premise 2: If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n\nIn modus ponens, if Premise 1 is true and Premise 2 (which is a conditional statement) is also true, then the conclusion must be true. In this case, the conclusion would be 'The muffins were blueberry'. Since both premises are given as true, we can infer that the conclusion is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
