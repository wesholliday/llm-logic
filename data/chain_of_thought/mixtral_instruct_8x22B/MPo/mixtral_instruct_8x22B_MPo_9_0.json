            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument using a rule of inference called modus ponens. Modus ponens states that if P is true and \"if P then Q\" is true, then Q is true. In this case, P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\". Since we know that P is true (Lisa bought the red shirt) and the rule \"if P then Q\" is also true (If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt), we can infer that Q is true (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
