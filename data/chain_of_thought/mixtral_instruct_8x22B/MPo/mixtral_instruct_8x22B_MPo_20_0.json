            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument that follows the form of modus ponens, which is a valid argument form. Modus ponens states that if P is true and \"if P then Q\" is true, then we can infer that Q is true. In this case, \"The apple was red\" is the P statement, and \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is the \"if P then Q\" statement. Since both of these statements are true, we can infer that the conclusion \"The banana was yellow\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
