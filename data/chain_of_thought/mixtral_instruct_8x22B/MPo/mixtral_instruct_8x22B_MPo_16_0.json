            "content": " Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument known as modus ponens. Modus ponens is a rule of inference that states if P is true and \"if P, then Q\" is true, then Q must also be true. In this case, \"The shirt was cotton\" is the P statement, and \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is the \"if P, then Q\" statement. Therefore, we can infer that \"The pants were denim\" (Q).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
