            "content": " Explanation: This logical argument is in the form of a basic if-then statement, also known as a conditional statement. The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is the conditional statement, where \"Tom watched football\" is the hypothesis (or antecedent), and \"Jen watched basketball\" is the conclusion (or consequent).\n\nGiven that the hypothesis is true (Tom watched football), we can apply the rule of inference called modus ponens, which states that if the hypothesis of a conditional statement is true, then the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, we can infer that Jen watched basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
