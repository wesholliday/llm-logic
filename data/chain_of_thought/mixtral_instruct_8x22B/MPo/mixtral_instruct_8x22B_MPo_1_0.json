            "content": " Explanation: This logical argument is an example of a type of reasoning called Modus Ponens. Modus Ponens is a valid argument form, which means that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In this case, the first premise is \"Mary was at the wedding,\" and the second premise is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" These premises are in the form of a conditional statement (if-then statement), where \"Mary was at the wedding\" is the antecedent (the \"if\" part), and \"Sue was at the wedding\" is the consequent (the \"then\" part). Since the antecedent is true (Mary was indeed at the wedding), we can infer that the consequent is also true, which means that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
