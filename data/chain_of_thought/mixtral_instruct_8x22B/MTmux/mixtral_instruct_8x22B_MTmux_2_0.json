            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements:\n1. If the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint.\n2. It's not the case that the wug must have bimmed the zoint.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can see that flooping the wug is a sufficient condition for the wug to have bimmed the zoint. This means that if the wug was flooped, then it must have bimmed the zoint.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that it's not the case that the wug must have bimmed the zoint. This is the negation of the consequent (the \"then\" part) of statement 1. In logic, if the consequent of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent (the \"if\" part) must also be false. This is known as the principle of contrapositive.\n\nTherefore, if it's not the case that the wug must have bimmed the zoint, then it must not be the case that the wug was flooped.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
