            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked' is a conditional statement, where 'the splat was morphed' is the hypothesis and 'the splat must have quanked' is the conclusion. The second statement 'It's not the case that the splat must have quanked' is the negation of the conclusion of the conditional statement. In logic, if the conclusion of a conditional statement is false, then the hypothesis must also be false. Therefore, if it's not the case that the splat must have quanked, then it must be true that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
