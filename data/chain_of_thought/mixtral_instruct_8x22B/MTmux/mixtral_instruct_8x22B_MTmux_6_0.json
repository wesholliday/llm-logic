            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink' is a conditional statement. The second statement 'It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink' is the negation of the consequent of the conditional statement. In logic, if a statement is in the form 'If P, then Q' and it is given that 'Q' is false, then 'P' must also be false. This is known as the principle of contrapositive. Therefore, if the grommet did not plop the frink, then it cannot be the case that the grommet was sploffed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
