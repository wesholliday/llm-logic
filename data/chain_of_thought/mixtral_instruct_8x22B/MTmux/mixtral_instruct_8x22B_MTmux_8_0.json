            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements:\n1. If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled.\n2. It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that cranking the sprocket is a sufficient condition for it to be daggled. This means that if the sprocket was cranked, it must have been daggled.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that it's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled. This means that the sprocket was not daggled.\n\nSince cranking the sprocket is a sufficient condition for it to be daggled, and we know that the sprocket was not daggled, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked. This is because if the sprocket had been cranked, it would have been daggled, but we know that it was not daggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
