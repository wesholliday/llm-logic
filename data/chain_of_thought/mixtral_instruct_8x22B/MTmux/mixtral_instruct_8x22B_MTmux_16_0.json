            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements and asked to infer a third statement from them. The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be written in the form \"If P, then Q.\" In this case, P is \"the sneg was crampled\" and Q is \"the sneg must have sproted the frink.\" The second statement is the negation of the consequent of the conditional statement, which can be written as \"Not Q.\" From these two statements, we can use the rule of inference called modus tollens to infer the negation of the antecedent, which can be written as \"Not P.\" In this case, \"Not P\" is \"The sneg was not crampled.\" Therefore, we can infer that \"The sneg was not crampled\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
