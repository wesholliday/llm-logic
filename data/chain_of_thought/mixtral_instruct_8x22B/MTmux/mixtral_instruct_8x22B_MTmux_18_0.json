            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged' is a conditional statement, where 'the shank was plooked' is the hypothesis and 'the shank must have been nugged' is the conclusion. The second statement 'It's not the case that the shank must have been nugged' is the negation of the conclusion of the conditional statement. In logic, if the conclusion of a conditional statement is false, then the hypothesis must also be false. Therefore, if it's not the case that the shank must have been nugged, then it must not be the case that the shank was plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
