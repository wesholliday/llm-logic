            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements:\n1. If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked. (This can be written as \"snurgled => crinked\")\n2. It's not the case that the fribble must have crinked. (This can be written as \"not crinked\")\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the fribble did not crink. Since the first statement tells us that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked, we can infer that the fribble was not snurgled. This is because if the fribble had been snurgled, it would have crinked, but we know that it did not crink.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
