            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements:\n1. If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged. This is a conditional statement, where the condition is \"the clug was fleeked\" and the conclusion is \"the clug must have been snugged\".\n2. It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged. This is the negation of the conclusion from the first statement.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can use the concept of contrapositive and modus tollens to infer the conclusion. The contrapositive of the first statement is: If the clug was not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked. This is logically equivalent to the first statement.\n\nSince we know that it's not the case that the clug must have been snugged (from the second statement), we can apply modus tollens to the contrapositive. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that says if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P is false. In this case, P is \"the clug was fleeked\" and Q is \"the clug must have been snugged\". Since Q is false (from the second statement), we can infer that P is false, i.e., the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
