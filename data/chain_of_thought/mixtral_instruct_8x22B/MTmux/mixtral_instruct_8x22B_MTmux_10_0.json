            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled' is a conditional statement, where 'the wug was sproinged' is the hypothesis and 'it must have been garpled' is the conclusion. The second statement 'It's not the case that the wug must have been garpled' is the negation of the conclusion of the conditional statement. In logic, if the conclusion of a conditional statement is false, then the hypothesis must also be false. Therefore, if it's not the case that the wug must have been garpled, then it must not be the case that the wug was sproinged.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
