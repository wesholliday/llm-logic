            "content": " Explanation: We have two statements here that can be treated as logical propositions. The first statement is a conditional proposition: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened.\" This can be written as p \u2192 q, where p is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and q is \"the dreb must have been spened.\" The second statement is the negation of q: \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been spened,\" which can be written as \u00acq.\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement p \u2192 q and we know that the consequent (q) is false (\u00acq), then we can infer that the antecedent (p) is also false. This is known as the principle of contrapositive, which states that p \u2192 q is logically equivalent to \u00acq \u2192 \u00acp. Therefore, if \"the dreb must have been spened\" is false (\u00acq), then \"the dreb was vroombed\" (p) must also be false (\u00acp).\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that \"The dreb was not vroombed.\"",
