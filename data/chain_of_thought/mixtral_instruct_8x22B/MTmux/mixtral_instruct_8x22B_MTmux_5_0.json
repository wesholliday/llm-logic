It's not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger could not have been fraggled. This is a logical implication of the first statement, known as the contrapositive.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the zinger was not necessarily smoogled. This means that the condition for the zinger to be fraggled (as stated in the first statement) is not met.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
