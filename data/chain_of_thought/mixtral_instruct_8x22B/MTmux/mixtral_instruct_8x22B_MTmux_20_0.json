            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned' is a conditional statement, where 'the fleeg was bluttered' is the hypothesis and 'it must have been surned' is the conclusion. The second statement 'It's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned' is the negation of the conclusion of the conditional statement. In logic, if a conditional statement is true and its conclusion is false, then the hypothesis must also be false. Therefore, if it's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned, and the conditional statement is true, then the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
