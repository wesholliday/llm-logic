            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled' is a conditional statement, also known as a sufficient condition. It means that if the condition of the wug being sproinged is met, then the consequence of it being garpled is guaranteed. However, this does not imply that the wug can only be garpled if it was sproinged. There could be other ways for the wug to be garpled. Therefore, the contrapositive 'If the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged' is a true statement, but the inverse 'If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled' is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No.",
