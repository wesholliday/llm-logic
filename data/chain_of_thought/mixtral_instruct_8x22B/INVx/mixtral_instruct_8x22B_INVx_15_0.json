            "content": " Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement of the form 'If P then Q', where P is 'the dreb was vroombed' and Q is 'the dreb was spened'. The inverse of this statement is 'If not P then not Q', which is 'If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened'. However, the inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot directly infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
