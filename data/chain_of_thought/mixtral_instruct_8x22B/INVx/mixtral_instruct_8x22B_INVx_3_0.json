            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked' is a conditional statement, also known as a material implication in logic. This statement tells us that if the antecedent (the splat was morphed) is true, then the consequent (the splat quanked) is also true. However, it does not tell us anything about what happens when the antecedent is false (the splat was not morphed).\n\nTo infer 'If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank', we would need to know that the converse of the original statement is true. The converse of a conditional statement swaps the hypothesis and the conclusion. In this case, the converse would be 'If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed'. However, we do not have this information, so we cannot make this inference.\n\nMoreover, the inference 'If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank' is actually the contrapositive of the original statement, not the converse. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. However, we still need to be careful because the truth of the original statement does not guarantee the truth of the converse.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank' from the given information.",
