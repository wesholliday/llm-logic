            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" is a conditional statement that tells us about the relationship between cranking and daggled sprockets. However, it does not provide information about what happens when the sprocket is not cranked. The inference \"If the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled\" is the contrapositive of the original statement, and in classical logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
