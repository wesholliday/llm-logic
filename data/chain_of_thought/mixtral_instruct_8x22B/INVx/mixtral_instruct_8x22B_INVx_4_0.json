            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\" is a conditional statement, also known as a sufficient condition. It means that if the fribble was snurgled, then it is guaranteed that the fribble crinked. However, this statement does not provide information about what happens when the fribble is not snurgled. The fribble could still crink for other reasons, or it might not crink at all. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink\" based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
