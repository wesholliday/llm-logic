            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink' is a conditional statement, also known as a sufficient condition. It means that if the condition (the sneg was crampled) is true, then the consequence (the sneg sproted the frink) is also true. However, it does not provide information about what happens when the condition is not true (the sneg was not crampled). Therefore, we cannot infer that 'If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink' because the sneg might have sproted the frink even if it was not crampled. This is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent.\n\nAnswer: No.",
