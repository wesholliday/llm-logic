            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked' is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement 'It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled' is a negation of the first condition in the disjunction. Since the first condition is not true, the second condition must be true for the disjunction to hold. Therefore, we can infer that 'The sprocket is cranked'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
