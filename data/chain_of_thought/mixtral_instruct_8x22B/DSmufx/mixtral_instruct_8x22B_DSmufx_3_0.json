            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed' is a disjunction, which means that either one or both of the conditions can be true. The statement 'It's not the case that the splat must be quanked' is a negation of one of the conditions in the disjunction. Since we know that the splat is not quanked, the only remaining possibility is that the splat is morphed. This is an example of the logical principle known as disjunctive syllogism, which states that if we have a disjunction (P or Q) and we know that P is false, then Q must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
