The propositions are \"Fido is inside\" and \"Fido must be in the garden\". The statement also tells us that it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden. Since the second proposition is false, for the disjunction to be true, the first proposition must be true. Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
