In this case, the proposition is \"the book is on the shelf\" and its negation is \"the book must be resting on the table.\" The statement also explicitly states that it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table. Therefore, by the law of excluded middle, if one proposition is true (the book is not on the table), then its negation must be true (the book is on the shelf).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
