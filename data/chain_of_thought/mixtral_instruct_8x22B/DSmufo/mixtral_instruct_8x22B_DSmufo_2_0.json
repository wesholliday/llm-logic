            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table' implies that the book does not necessarily have to be on the table. However, the second statement 'Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf' presents two mutually exclusive options for the location of the book. Since we know that the book is not necessarily on the table, the only remaining option is that the book is on the shelf. This is a valid inference based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
