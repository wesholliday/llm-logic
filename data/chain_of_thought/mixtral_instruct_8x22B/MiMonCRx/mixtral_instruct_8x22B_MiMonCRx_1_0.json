            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The flibbit might be zorped and gribbled' implies that the flibbit could potentially be both zorped and gribbled at the same time. However, the use of 'and' suggests that these are two separate conditions. Therefore, it is also possible that the flibbit might only be zorped, or only be gribbled, or both. Since the statement does not exclude the possibility of the flibbit being gribbled without being zorped, we can infer that 'The flibbit might be gribbled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
