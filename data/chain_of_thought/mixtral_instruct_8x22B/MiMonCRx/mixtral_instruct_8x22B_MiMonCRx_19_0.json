            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The blimple might be snorked and frobbed' implies that the blimple could possibly undergo two actions: being snorked and being frobbed. The use of 'and' suggests that both actions are connected, meaning that if the blimple is snorked, it is also frobbed. Therefore, if the blimple might be snorked and frobbed, it is also possible that the blimple might be frobbed independently.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
