            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical construct known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens takes the form: If P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P. In this case, P is 'Mary was at the wedding' and Q is 'Sue was at the wedding'. The argument states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. It is then stated that Sue was not at the wedding. From this, it can be logically concluded that Mary was not at the wedding. This is a valid form of argument because if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
