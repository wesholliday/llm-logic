            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical structure known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens has the following structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P represents \"the vampire was awake\" and Q represents \"the mummy was awake\". The first premise is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\", which matches the form of the first statement in modus tollens. The second premise is \"The mummy was not awake\", which matches the form of the second statement in modus tollens. The conclusion is \"The vampire was not awake\", which matches the form of the conclusion in modus tollens.\n\nSince the argument matches the form of modus tollens, and modus tollens is a valid form of argument, this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
