            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical construct known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P is false. In this case, P is the statement 'The shirt was cotton' and Q is the statement 'The pants were denim'. The first premise is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim', which can be written as P implies Q. The second premise is 'The pants were not denim', which means Q is false. Therefore, according to modus tollens, P must be false, which means 'The shirt was not cotton'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
