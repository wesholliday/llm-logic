            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical construct known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states if the consequent of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent must also be false. In this case, the first premise is a conditional statement: 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'. The second premise states that the consequent of the conditional statement is false: 'Lucy did not go to the zoo'. Therefore, according to the rule of modus tollens, the antecedent of the conditional statement must also be false: 'Joe did not go to the park'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
