            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical construct known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P is false. In this case, P is 'The bear was in the cave' and Q is 'The wolf was in the den'. The first premise is 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den', which can be written as P implies Q. The second premise is 'The wolf was not in the den', which means Q is false. According to the rule of modus tollens, if both premises are true, then the conclusion 'The bear was not in the cave' (P is false) must be true. Therefore, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
