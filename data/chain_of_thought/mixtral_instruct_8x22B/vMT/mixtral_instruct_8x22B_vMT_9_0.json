            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical construct known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P is false. In this case, P is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and Q is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. The first premise states that P implies Q, and the second premise states that Q is false. Therefore, according to modus tollens, P must be false.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that logical validity only refers to the structure of the argument, not the truth of its premises. If the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. But if the premises are false, the conclusion may or may not be true. In this case, if the premises are true (i.e., Lisa would only buy the red shirt if Mark bought the blue shirt, and Mark did not buy the blue shirt), then the conclusion (Lisa did not buy the red shirt) must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid.",
