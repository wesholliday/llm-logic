            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical structure called \"modus tollens,\" which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states \"If P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\" In this case, \"If Jeff played basketball (P), then Amy played tennis (Q). Amy did not play tennis (Not Q). Therefore, Jeff did not play basketball (Not P).\" Since the argument follows the form of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
