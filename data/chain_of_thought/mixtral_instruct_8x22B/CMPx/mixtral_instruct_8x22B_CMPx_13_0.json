    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantug, a loperit, and a frallon are shortlisted for Blither of the Year. Industry watchers consider the fantug the front runner, followed by the loperit, while the frallon is a heavy underdog. Since these are the only products in contention, if the loperit doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the fantug doesn\u2019t win, the frallon will win. Moreover, the fantug likely will win the award and hence the loperit likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantug doesn't win Blither of the Year, the frallon will?",

            "content": " Explanation: The argument states that the fantug is the front runner and is likely to win the award, while the loperit is less likely to win. It also states that if the loperit doesn't win and the fantug doesn't win, then the frallon will win. However, this does not necessarily mean that it's likely that if the fantug doesn't win, the frallon will. The likelihood of the frallon winning depends on the likelihood of both the fantug and the loperit not winning. Since the loperit is also less likely to win than the fantug, it's possible that the loperit could still win even if the fantug doesn't. Therefore, it's not necessarily likely that if the fantug doesn't win, the frallon will.\n\nAnswer: No.",
