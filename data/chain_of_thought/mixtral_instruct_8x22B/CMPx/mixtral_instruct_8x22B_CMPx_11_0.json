    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trenist, a lanken, and a draloid are shortlisted for Drij of the Year. The trenist is considered the front runner, followed by the lanken, while the draloid is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates in contention, if the lanken doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the trenist doesn\u2019t win it, the draloid will win it. Moreover, the trenist likely will win the award and hence the lanken likely won\u2019t win it. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trenist doesn\u2019t win Drij of the Year, the draloid will?",

            "content": " Explanation: The information given states that the trenist is the front runner and is likely to win the award, followed by the lanken, while the draloid is a long shot. It is also stated that if the lanken doesn't win the award and the trenist doesn't win it either, then the draloid will win it. However, the likelihood of the trenist winning the award implies that the lanken is less likely to win it, but it does not provide information on the likelihood of the draloid winning the award if the trenist doesn't win it. Therefore, it cannot be determined that it's likely that if the trenist doesn't win Drij of the Year, the draloid will.\n\nAnswer: No.",
