    "user_prompt": "Suppose a fantole, a dribban, and a snorpul have the best odds to win this season's Rizzle Cup. Oddsmakers believe it's most probable the fantole will capture the cup, followed by the dribban, while the snorpul is a heavy longshot. Since these are the only top contenders, if the dribban doesn\u2019t win the cup, then if the fantole doesn\u2019t win, the snorpul will win. Moreover, the fantole likely will win the cup and hence the dribban likely won't win. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": " Explanation: The reasoning provided in the prompt is based on the premise that the fantole is the most likely to win the Rizzle Cup, followed by the dribban, and then the snorpul as a longshot. It is also stated that if the dribban doesn't win, and the fantole doesn't win, then the snorpul will win. However, the likelihood of the snorpul winning is not directly related to the likelihood of the fantole not winning. The fact that the fantole is likely to win does not necessarily imply that the snorpul is likely to win if the fantole doesn't. The dribban, being the second most likely to win, would still have a higher chance of winning than the snorpul if the fantole doesn't win. Therefore, it is not necessarily likely that if the fantole doesn't win, the snorpul will.\n\nAnswer: No.",
