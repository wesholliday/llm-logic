    "user_prompt": "Suppose a stribben, a vanoon, and a jentapp are applying to rent a bondle. The owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant, followed by the vanoon, while the jentapp seems much less qualified to rent a bondle. Since these are the only applicants, if the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, then if the stribben isn\u2019t selected, the jentapp will be selected. Moreover, the stribben likely will be chosen and hence the vanoon likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the stribben isn\u2019t selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be?",

            "content": " Explanation: The information given suggests that the stribben is the most likely to be selected, followed by the vanoon, and then the jentapp. It is also stated that if the vanoon isn't selected and then the stribben isn't selected, the jentapp will be selected. However, this does not necessarily mean that it's likely that if the stribben isn't selected, the jentapp will be. The likelihood of the jentapp being selected depends on the likelihood of both the stribben and the vanoon not being selected. Since the vanoon is considered a stronger applicant than the jentapp, it's not necessarily likely that the vanoon won't be selected if the stribben isn't. Therefore, it's not necessarily likely that if the stribben isn't selected, the jentapp will be.\n\nAnswer: No.",
