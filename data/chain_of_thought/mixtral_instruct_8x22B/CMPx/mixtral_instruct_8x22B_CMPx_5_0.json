    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fraglen, a darpil, and a votal are the top bispil teams this season. The fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, while the votal trails far behind. These lead the league, so if the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn\u2019t, the votal will. Moreover, the fraglen likely will lead the league and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fraglen doesn\u2019t lead the league, the votal will?",

            "content": " Explanation: The information provided states that the fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, while the votal trails far behind. This means that the fraglen is the most likely to lead the league, followed by the darpil, and then the votal. The statement \"if the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn\u2019t, the votal will\" is a conditional statement that only applies if both the darpil and the fraglen do not have the top record. However, the statement \"the fraglen likely will lead the league and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t\" suggests that it is unlikely that both the fraglen and the darpil will not have the top record. Therefore, it is not necessarily likely that if the fraglen doesn\u2019t lead the league, the votal will.\n\nAnswer: No.",
