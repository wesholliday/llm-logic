    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a garplex, a beelhet, and a peedonk are competing to be domer of the year. Experts think the garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, with the peedonk having a much lower chance. Since these are the only domer candidates, if the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer. Moreover, it is likely the garplex will become domer and hence the beelhet likely won\u2019t become domer. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will?",

            "content": " Explanation: The information given suggests that the garplex is the most likely to become domer, followed by the beelhet, and then the peedonk. If the garplex doesn't become domer, the next most likely candidate is the beelhet, not the peedonk. However, the statement \"if the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer\" implies that if both the garplex and the beelhet don't become domer, then the peedonk will. This doesn't necessarily mean that it's likely for the peedonk to become domer if the garplex doesn't, because the beelhet is still a strong candidate. The likelihood of the peedonk becoming domer would depend on the probability of both the garplex and the beelhet not becoming domer. Since the beelhet is a close competitor to the garplex, it's not necessarily likely that the peedonk will become domer if the garplex doesn't.\n\nAnswer: No.",
