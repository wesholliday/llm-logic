    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

            "content": " Explanation: The information provided states that the jantiz is the most qualified applicant and is likely to get the zulision. This implies that the probability of the jantiz getting the zulision is higher than the probability of the cramen or the sulect getting it. However, the information does not provide any specific probabilities for each applicant getting the zulision.\n\nGiven that the jantiz is likely to get the zulision, it can be inferred that the probability of the cramen getting the zulision is lower than the probability of the jantiz getting it. However, this does not necessarily mean that the probability of the sulect getting the zulision is higher than the probability of the cramen getting it.\n\nThe statement \"if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will\" is a conditional statement that only applies if both the cramen and the jantiz do not get the zulision. However, this does not provide any information about the probability of the sulect getting the zulision if only the jantiz does not get it.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it cannot be determined whether it is likely that if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will.\n\nAnswer: No.",
