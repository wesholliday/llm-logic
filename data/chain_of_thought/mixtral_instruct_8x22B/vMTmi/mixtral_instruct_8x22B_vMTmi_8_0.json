            "content": " Explanation: This argument is not logically valid. The logical form of the argument is as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If A, then B (If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake)\nPremise 2: Not B (The mummy might not have been awake)\nConclusion: Not A (The vampire was not awake)\n\nThis is a form of argument known as denying the consequent, which is a valid form of argument. However, the second premise is not a definitive statement that the mummy was not awake, but rather a statement of possibility that the mummy might not have been awake. This introduces uncertainty into the argument, making it invalid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
