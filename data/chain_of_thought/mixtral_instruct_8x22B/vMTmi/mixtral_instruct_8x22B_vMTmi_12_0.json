            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a contrapositive argument, where the conclusion is inferred by denying the consequent of the first premise. The first premise states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. The second premise states that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo, which is equivalent to saying that it is possible that Lucy did not go to the zoo. If we accept the first premise as true, then the only way for the second premise to be true is if Joe did not go to the park. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
