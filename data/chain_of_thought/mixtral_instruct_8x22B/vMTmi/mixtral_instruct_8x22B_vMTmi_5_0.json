            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a conditional statement (if-then) and its contrapositive. The first premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\". The second premise states that Amy might not have played tennis, which is the negation of the consequent (Q) in the first premise. The conclusion states that Jeff did not play basketball, which is the negation of the antecedent (P) in the first premise.\n\nIn a logically valid argument, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In this case, if the first premise is true and Amy did not play tennis (as stated in the second premise), then it must be true that Jeff did not play basketball (the conclusion). This is because the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if \"If P, then Q\" is true, then \"If not Q, then not P\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid.",
