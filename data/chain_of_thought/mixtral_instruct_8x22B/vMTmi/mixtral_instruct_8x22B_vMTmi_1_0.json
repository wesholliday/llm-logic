            "content": " Explanation: This argument is not logically valid. The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This is a conditional statement, and it only tells us about the relationship between Mary and Sue's presence at the wedding. It does not provide any information about what would happen if Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nThe second premise states that Sue might not have been at the wedding. This introduces the possibility that Sue was not at the wedding, but it does not confirm it. It is important to note that \"might not have been\" does not mean the same thing as \"was not\".\n\nThe conclusion states that Mary was not at the wedding. However, the premises do not logically lead to this conclusion. Even if Sue might not have been at the wedding, it does not necessarily mean that Mary was not at the wedding. It is possible that Mary was at the wedding and Sue was not, which would not violate the first premise.\n\nAnswer: No.",
