            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a conditional statement (if-then) and its contrapositive. The first premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\". The second premise states that Jen might not have watched basketball, which is the negation of the consequent (Q) in the conditional statement. The conclusion states that Tom did not watch football, which is the negation of the antecedent (P) in the conditional statement.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the conditional statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true. In this case, the contrapositive of the first premise would be \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\". Since the second premise states that Jen might not have watched basketball, it is suggesting that the contrapositive of the first premise might be true. Therefore, the conclusion that Tom did not watch football is a valid logical deduction from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
