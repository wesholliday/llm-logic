            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. This statement tells us that if the condition (the book was written by James) is true, then the conclusion (the book is a mystery novel) is also true. However, it does not tell us anything about what happens when the condition is not true. In other words, it does not tell us what kind of book it is if it was not written by James. Therefore, from the statement \"The book was not written by James\", we cannot infer that \"The book is not a mystery novel\". It could still be a mystery novel written by someone else.\n\nAnswer: No.",
