If the hypothesis is true, then the conclusion must also be true. However, if the hypothesis is false, the conditional statement does not tell us anything about the truth of the conclusion. In this case, we are given that \"Alex did not finish the race,\" which means the hypothesis is false. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about whether Chris finished the race or not based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
