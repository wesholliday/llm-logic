            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is a conditional statement. The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\" This is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the original statement does not tell us anything about what the truck is made of if the doll is not plastic. It only tells us that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. Therefore, from the statement \"The doll was not plastic,\" we cannot infer that \"The truck was not metal.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
