            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest' is a conditional statement, also known as a material implication. This statement does not imply that the unicorn is in the forest only if the griffin is in the forest. It only states that if the condition (the griffin being in the forest) is true, then the conclusion (the unicorn being in the forest) is also true. However, if the condition is not met (the griffin is not in the forest), the statement does not provide any information about the location of the unicorn. Therefore, from 'The griffin was not in the forest', we cannot infer 'The unicorn was not in the forest'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
