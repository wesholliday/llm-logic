            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (the vampire being awake) is true, then the conclusion (the mummy being awake) is also true. However, if the condition is not true (the vampire is not awake), the statement does not tell us anything about the conclusion. In this case, we are given that the condition is not true, i.e., 'The vampire was not awake'. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the mummy's state of wakefulness from this statement alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
