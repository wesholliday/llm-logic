If the hypothesis is true, then the conclusion must also be true. However, if the hypothesis is false, the conditional statement does not tell us anything about the truth of the conclusion. In this case, we are given that 'Ben did not eat pasta', which means the hypothesis is false. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about whether Kate ate the salad or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
