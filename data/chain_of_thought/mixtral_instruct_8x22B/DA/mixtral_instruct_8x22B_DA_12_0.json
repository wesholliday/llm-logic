However, the statement 'Joe did not go to the park' contradicts the hypothesis of the conditional statement. In logic, when the hypothesis of a conditional statement is false, the statement as a whole is considered true, regardless of the truth value of the conclusion. This is known as a vacuous truth. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about Lucy's actions from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
