            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement, where \"the shirt was cotton\" is the hypothesis and \"the pants were denim\" is the conclusion. The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\" Since a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can infer that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\n\nHowever, the statement \"The shirt was not cotton\" is not the contrapositive of the original statement, but rather the negation of the hypothesis. The negation of the hypothesis does not necessarily imply the negation of the conclusion. In this case, we cannot directly infer that \"The pants were not denim\" from \"The shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
