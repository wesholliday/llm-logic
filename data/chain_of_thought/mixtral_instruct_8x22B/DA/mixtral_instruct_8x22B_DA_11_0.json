            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. In this case, 'the cake was chocolate' is the hypothesis, and 'the muffins were blueberry' is the conclusion. However, the statement does not say that the muffins could only be blueberry if the cake was chocolate. It also does not say that the muffins could not be blueberry if the cake was not chocolate. Therefore, from the statement 'The cake was not chocolate', we cannot infer that 'The muffins were not blueberry'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
