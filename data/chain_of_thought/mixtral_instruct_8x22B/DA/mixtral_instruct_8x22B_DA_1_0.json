            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement, also known as a material implication. This means that if the first part (the antecedent, 'Mary was at the wedding') is true, then the second part (the consequent, 'Sue was at the wedding') must also be true. However, if the antecedent is false (as in this case, 'Mary was not at the wedding'), the conditional statement does not tell us anything about the truth or falsity of the consequent. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'Sue was not at the wedding' based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
