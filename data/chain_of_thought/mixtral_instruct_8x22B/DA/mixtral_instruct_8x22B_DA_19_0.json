            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' is a conditional statement, where 'Tom watched football' is the hypothesis and 'Jen watched basketball' is the conclusion. However, we are also given that 'Tom did not watch football', which means the hypothesis of the conditional statement is false. In logic, when the hypothesis of a conditional statement is false, the statement itself doesn't tell us anything about the truth or falsity of the conclusion. Therefore, we cannot infer whether Jen watched basketball or not based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
