            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument that can be analyzed using the principles of deductive reasoning. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement (if-then statement) and the additional information that the condition did not occur. The conditional statement is \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\" This can be rewritten as \"The wug was sproinged implies the wug was garpled.\" The additional information is \"The wug was not sproinged.\"\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement and a negation of its hypothesis (the \"if\" part) allows us to infer the negation of the conclusion (the \"then\" part). This is known as the principle of contrapositive. In this case, the contrapositive of the original statement would be \"If the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged.\" Since we know that the wug was not sproinged, we can infer that the wug was not garpled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
