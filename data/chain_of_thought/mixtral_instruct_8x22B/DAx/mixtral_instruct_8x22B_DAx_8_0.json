            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled' is a conditional statement, where 'the sprocket was cranked' is the hypothesis and 'the sprocket was daggled' is the conclusion. This means that if the hypothesis is true, then the conclusion must also be true. However, if the hypothesis is false, the conditional statement does not tell us anything about the truth of the conclusion. In this case, we are given that 'The sprocket was not cranked', which means the hypothesis is false. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about whether the sprocket was daggled or not from this conditional statement alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
