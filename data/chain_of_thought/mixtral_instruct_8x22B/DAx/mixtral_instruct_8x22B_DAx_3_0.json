            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked' is a conditional statement, where 'the splat was morphed' is the hypothesis and 'the splat quanked' is the conclusion. The second statement 'The splat was not morphed' negates the hypothesis of the conditional statement. In logic, when the hypothesis of a conditional statement is false, the statement as a whole is considered true, regardless of the truth value of the conclusion. This is known as the principle of vacuous truth. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The splat did not quank' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
