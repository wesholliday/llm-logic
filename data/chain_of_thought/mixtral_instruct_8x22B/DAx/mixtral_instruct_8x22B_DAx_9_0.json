If the hypothesis is false, then the conditional statement doesn't tell us anything about the conclusion. In this case, we are given that 'The twonk was not plinked', which means the hypothesis is false. Therefore, we cannot infer whether 'The twonk was not varnished' based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
