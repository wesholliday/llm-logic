If the hypothesis is true, then the conclusion is also true. However, if the hypothesis is false, the conditional statement does not tell us anything about the conclusion. In this case, we are given that 'The whiffle was not shanked', which means the hypothesis is false. Therefore, we cannot infer whether 'The whiffle did not tink' based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
