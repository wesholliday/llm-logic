            "content": " Explanation: This is a logical reasoning problem that can be solved using the concept of contrapositive. The original statement is \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\" Since a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nGiven that \"The dreb was not vroombed,\" we can use the contrapositive to infer that \"The dreb was not spened.\" This is because if the dreb not being spened implies that it was not vroombed, and we know that it was not vroombed, then it must be true that the dreb was not spened.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
