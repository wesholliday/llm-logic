            "content": " Explanation: The statements given are in the form of a conditional statement and a negation. The conditional statement is \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged,\" which can be written as \"Fleeked => Snugged.\" The negation is \"The clug was not fleeked,\" which is the negation of the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn logic, when the antecedent of a conditional statement is false (negated), the conditional statement as a whole is considered true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent (the \"then\" part). This is known as the principle of vacuous truth. Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer whether the clug was snugged or not, because the conditional statement is not applicable when the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that 'The clug was not snugged' from the given statements.",
