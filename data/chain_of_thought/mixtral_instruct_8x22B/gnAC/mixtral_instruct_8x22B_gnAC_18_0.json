            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. This statement tells us that if the condition (the doll being plastic) is true, then the consequence (the truck being metal) is also true. However, this statement does not tell us anything about what happens when the consequence is true. In other words, just because the truck is metal, we cannot automatically conclude that the doll is plastic. The doll could be made of any material, and the truck would still be metal.\n\nAnswer: No.",
