            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is a conditional statement, also known as a material implication. This statement is true if both the vampire and the mummy are awake, or if the vampire is asleep. However, the statement does not tell us anything about what happens when the mummy is awake. It only tells us that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake.\n\nGiven that \"The mummy was awake\" is true, we cannot definitively say that \"The vampire was awake\" is true based solely on the first statement. This is because the first statement is a one-way implication, meaning that it only tells us about the state of the mummy when the vampire is awake, not the other way around.\n\nAnswer: No.",
