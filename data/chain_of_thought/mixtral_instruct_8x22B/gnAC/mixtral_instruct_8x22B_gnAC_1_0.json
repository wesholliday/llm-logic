            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement, also known as a material implication. In this case, \"Mary was at the wedding\" is the hypothesis, and \"Sue was at the wedding\" is the conclusion. The statement is true if both the hypothesis and conclusion are true, or if the hypothesis is false and the conclusion is true. However, the truth of the conclusion does not imply the truth of the hypothesis. In other words, just because Sue was at the wedding, it does not necessarily mean that Mary was at the wedding. The statement only tells us that if Mary was there, then Sue was there too, but it does not tell us anything about whether Mary was there if Sue was.\n\nAnswer: No.",
