In this case, we are given the statement \"The plonk might fizzle\" and asked if we can infer \"The plonk might flimble and fizzle\". The word \"flimble\" is not defined in the context, so we cannot make any assumptions about its meaning or relationship to \"fizzle\". Therefore, without additional context or information, we cannot logically infer that \"The plonk might flimble and fizzle\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
