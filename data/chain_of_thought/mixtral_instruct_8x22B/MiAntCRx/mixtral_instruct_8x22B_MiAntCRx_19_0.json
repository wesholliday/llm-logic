In this case, we are given the statement \"The zazzle might fizzle\" and asked if we can infer \"The zazzle might quibble and fizzle\". The original statement only mentions the possibility of the zazzle fizzling, but it does not provide any information about the zazzle quibbling. Since the concept of quibbling is not mentioned in the original statement, we cannot logically infer that the zazzle might quibble and fizzle based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: No.",
