            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The event must have been formal' implies that the event was serious, professional, or ceremonial in nature. However, the term 'formal' does not necessarily include 'black-tie' as a requirement. Black-tie events are a specific type of formal event that require a more strict dress code, typically involving a tuxedo for men and a formal gown for women. Therefore, while all black-tie events are formal, not all formal events are black-tie.\n\nAnswer: No.",
