            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays\" is a definitive statement that the restaurant was not open for business on Mondays. The statement \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays or had limited hours\" introduces an additional possibility that the restaurant was open, but with limited hours, on Mondays. However, the original statement does not provide any information about the restaurant having limited hours on Mondays. Therefore, we cannot infer from the original statement that the restaurant had limited hours on Mondays.\n\nAnswer: No.",
