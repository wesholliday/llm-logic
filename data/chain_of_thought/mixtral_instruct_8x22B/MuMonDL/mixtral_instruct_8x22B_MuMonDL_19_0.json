However, the statement does not provide any information about how the completed application was submitted. It could have been submitted electronically (e.g., by clicking a 'submit' button on the online platform), but it could also have been printed out and submitted in person or by mail. Therefore, while it is true that the application was completed online, we cannot infer that it was also submitted electronically.\n\nAnswer: No.",
