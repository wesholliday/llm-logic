            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The contract must have been valid for a year' specifies a minimum duration for the contract's validity. It does not provide any information about the maximum duration of the contract. Therefore, it is possible that the contract could have been valid for a year or longer. However, the original statement does not explicitly state that the contract must have been valid for longer than a year. It only establishes that the contract was valid for at least a year.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that 'The contract must have been valid for a year or longer' from the given statement.",
