            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"The package must have been delivered today\" is a definitive statement that implies the package was delivered on the day the statement was made. Adding \"or tomorrow\" to the statement introduces a new possibility that was not present in the original statement. This changes the meaning of the original statement and introduces uncertainty. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The package must have been delivered today or tomorrow\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
