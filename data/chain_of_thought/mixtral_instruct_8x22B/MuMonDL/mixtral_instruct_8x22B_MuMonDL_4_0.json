However, the statement does not provide any information about whether the meeting was rescheduled or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that the meeting was rescheduled based solely on the given statement. The statement 'The meeting must have been scheduled for 2 PM or been rescheduled' would imply that there is a possibility that the meeting was rescheduled, but this possibility is not suggested by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
