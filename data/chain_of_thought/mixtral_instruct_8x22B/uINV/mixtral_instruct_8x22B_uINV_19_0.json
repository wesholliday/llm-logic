            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is a conditional statement, also known as a sufficient condition. This means that if the condition (Tom watching football) is true, then the consequence (Jen watching basketball) is also true. However, this does not imply that if the condition is not true (Tom did not watch football), then the consequence is not true (Jen did not watch basketball). In other words, the original statement does not provide enough information to infer what Jen did or did not watch if Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: No.",
