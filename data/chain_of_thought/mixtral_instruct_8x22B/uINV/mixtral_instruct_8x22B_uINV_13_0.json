            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement, also known as a sufficient condition. This means that if the car is red, then it is sufficient to conclude that the truck is blue. However, this does not imply that the truck cannot be blue if the car is not red. The color of the truck could be blue regardless of the color of the car. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\n\nAnswer: No.",
