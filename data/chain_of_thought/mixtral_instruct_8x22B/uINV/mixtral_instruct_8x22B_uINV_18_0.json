            "content": " Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q.\" In this case, P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not Q, then not P,\" which would be \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\" However, the question asks about the inverse of the original statement, which is \"If not P, then not Q,\" or \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\" In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, but a statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to its inverse. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
