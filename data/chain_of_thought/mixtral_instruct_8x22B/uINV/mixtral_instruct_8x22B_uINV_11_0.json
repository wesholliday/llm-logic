            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is a conditional statement, also known as a logical implication. This statement tells us that the condition (the cake being chocolate) leads to a certain result (the muffins being blueberry). However, it does not tell us anything about what happens when the condition is not met (the cake is not chocolate). Therefore, we cannot infer that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry. The muffins could still be blueberry even if the cake was not chocolate, as the statement does not provide information about this scenario.\n\nAnswer: No.",
