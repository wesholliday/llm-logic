            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. In this case, \"Joe went to the park\" is the hypothesis, and \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is the conclusion. However, this statement does not provide information about what happens when the hypothesis is false, i.e., when Joe did not go to the park. It is possible that Lucy went to the zoo regardless of whether Joe went to the park or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: No.",
