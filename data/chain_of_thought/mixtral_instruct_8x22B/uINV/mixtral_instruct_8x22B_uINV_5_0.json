            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is a conditional statement, also known as a sufficient condition. This means that if the condition (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the consequence (Amy playing tennis) is also true. However, this statement does not provide information about what happens when the condition is not met (Jeff not playing basketball). Therefore, we cannot infer that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis. This is because Amy could still have played tennis even if Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: No.",
