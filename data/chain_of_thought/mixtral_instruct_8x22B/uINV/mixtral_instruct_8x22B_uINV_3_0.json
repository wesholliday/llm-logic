            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is a conditional statement, also known as a sufficient condition. This means that if the condition (the book was written by James) is true, then the consequence (the book is a mystery novel) is also true. However, this does not imply that the book can only be a mystery novel if it was written by James. There could be other authors who also write mystery novels. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: No.",
