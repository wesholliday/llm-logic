            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement, also known as a logical implication. This statement tells us that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the conclusion (the banana being yellow) is also true. However, this statement does not provide any information about what happens when the condition is not true (i.e., the apple is not red). Therefore, we cannot infer that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow. The color of the banana could be yellow, or it could be some other color, regardless of the color of the apple.\n\nAnswer: No.",
