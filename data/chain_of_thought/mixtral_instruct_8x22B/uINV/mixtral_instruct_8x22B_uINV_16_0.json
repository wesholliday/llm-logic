            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (the shirt being cotton) is true, then the conclusion (the pants being denim) is also true. However, this statement does not provide any information about what happens when the condition is not true (i.e., the shirt is not cotton). Therefore, we cannot infer that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim. The pants could still be denim even if the shirt is not cotton.\n\nAnswer: No.",
