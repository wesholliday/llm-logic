            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (the dog being inside) is true, then the conclusion (the cat being outside) is also true. However, this statement does not provide any information about what happens when the condition is not true (the dog is not inside). Therefore, we cannot infer that if the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside. This is because the cat could still be outside even if the dog is not inside.\n\nAnswer: No.",
