            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The application must have been completed online and included references' implies two conditions that must be met for the application to be valid. The first condition is that the application must have been completed online, and the second condition is that it must have included references. Since the statement uses the conjunction 'and' to connect these two conditions, both must be true.
