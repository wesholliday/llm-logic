            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM\" is a conjunction of two separate pieces of information: \"The concert must have been sold out\" and \"The concert started at 8 PM\". In logic, this is known as a conjunction, where both parts of the statement must be true for the entire statement to be true. However, the truth of one part of the conjunction does not depend on the truth of the other part. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that \"The concert must have been sold out\" without needing to know whether the concert started at 8 PM or not.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
