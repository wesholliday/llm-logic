            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been signed and notarized\" implies two separate actions: signing and notarizing. Notarization is a process that typically follows signing, where a notary public witnesses the signature and verifies its authenticity. Therefore, for a document to be notarized, it must first be signed. This means that if a document must have been notarized, it logically follows that it must have also been signed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
