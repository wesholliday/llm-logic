            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM and in the conference room\" is a conjunction of two clauses: \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM\" and \"The meeting must have been in the conference room\". In logic, a conjunction is true only if both of its constituent clauses are true. Therefore, if the entire statement is true, then it must be the case that \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM\" is also true. This is an example of simplification, a valid rule of inference in logic.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
