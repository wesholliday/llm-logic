It does not provide any information about the location of the book. Therefore, we cannot infer that the book is on the shelf based solely on this statement. The book might be on the shelf, but it could also be in a bag, on a table, or anywhere else. The statement does not give us enough information to make a conclusion about the book's location.\n\nAnswer: No.",
