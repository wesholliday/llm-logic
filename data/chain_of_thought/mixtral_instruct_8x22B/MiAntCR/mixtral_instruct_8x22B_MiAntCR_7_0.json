            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The exam might cover all chapters' suggests that the exam could potentially include questions from every chapter in the course material. However, the difficulty of the exam is not explicitly stated or implied in this sentence. The difficulty of an exam can depend on various factors such as the complexity of the questions, the time allotted, and the student's understanding of the material, not just the number of chapters covered. Therefore, while it's possible that an exam covering all chapters could be difficult, it's not necessarily true in all cases.\n\nAnswer: No.",
