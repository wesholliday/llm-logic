            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"The document might be notarized\" implies that there is a possibility that the document has been officially authenticated by a notary public. Notarization typically involves a notary public witnessing the signing of the document and verifying the identities of the parties involved. Therefore, if a document is notarized, it is reasonable to infer that it has been signed. However, the original statement does not explicitly state that the document is signed, only that it might be notarized. The act of notarization itself does not necessarily mean that the document is signed, but in practical terms, it often implies that a signature is present.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
