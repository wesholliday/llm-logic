            "content": " Explanation: We have two statements that can be considered as premises for our logical deduction. The first premise is a negation of a statement, which can be rephrased as \"It is possible that the muffins were not blueberry.\" The second premise is a conditional statement, which can be rephrased as \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not necessarily blueberry.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationship between these two premises. If we assume that the cake was chocolate, then according to the second premise, the muffins must have been blueberry. However, this contradicts the first premise, which states that it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry. Therefore, the assumption that the cake was chocolate leads to a contradiction.\n\nThe only way to resolve this contradiction is to conclude that the cake was not chocolate. This is because if the cake was not chocolate, then the second premise does not apply, and there is no contradiction with the first premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
