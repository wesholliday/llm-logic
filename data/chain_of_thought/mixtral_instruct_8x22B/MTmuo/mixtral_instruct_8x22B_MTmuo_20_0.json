            "content": " Explanation: We have two statements that can be analyzed using logical principles. The first statement is a negation of a necessity, which can be interpreted as \"It's possible that the banana was not yellow.\" The second statement is a conditional statement, which can be interpreted as \"If the antecedent (the apple was red) is true, then the consequent (the banana must have been yellow) must also be true.\"\n\nNow, if we were to assume that the apple was red, then according to the second statement, the banana must have been yellow. However, this contradicts the first statement, which states that it's possible that the banana was not yellow. Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, the assumption that the apple was red must be false.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that the apple was not red.",
