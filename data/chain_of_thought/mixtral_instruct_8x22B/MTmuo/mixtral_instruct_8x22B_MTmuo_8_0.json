            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake' can be interpreted as 'The mummy might not have been awake'. This means that the mummy being awake is not a certainty. The second statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake' is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the antecedent (the vampire was awake) is true, then the consequent (the mummy must have been awake) must also be true. However, if the consequent is false (the mummy might not have been awake), then the antecedent must also be false (the vampire was not awake). This is based on the logical rule of contrapositive, which states that if a conditional statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer 'The vampire was not awake'.",
