            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt' implies that Mark could have bought a shirt of a different color or not bought a shirt at all. The second statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the antecedent) is true, then the second part (the consequent) must also be true. However, if the consequent is false (as implied by the first statement), then the antecedent must also be false according to the rules of logic. Therefore, if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa could not have bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
