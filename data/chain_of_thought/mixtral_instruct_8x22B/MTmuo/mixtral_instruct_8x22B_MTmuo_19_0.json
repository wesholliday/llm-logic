            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements:\n1. It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. This can be interpreted as \"Jen did not necessarily watch basketball.\"\n2. If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This is a conditional statement where the consequent (Jen must have watched basketball) is false based on the first statement. According to the principle of contrapositive, if the consequent is false, then the antecedent (Tom watched football) must also be false.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
