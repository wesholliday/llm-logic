            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel' implies that the book could be any genre other than a mystery novel. The second statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel' is a conditional statement that tells us that all books written by James are mystery novels. However, this does not necessarily mean that all mystery novels are written by James. Combining these two statements, we can infer that if the book is not a mystery novel, then it cannot have been written by James, as all of James' books are mystery novels. Therefore, if the book is not a mystery novel, it must be true that 'The book was not written by James'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
