            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den' implies that the wolf's presence in the den is not a certainty. On the other hand, 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den' is a conditional statement that says if the antecedent (the bear was in the cave) is true, then the consequent (the wolf must have been in the den) must also be true. However, since we know that the wolf's presence in the den is not a certainty, it implies that the antecedent (the bear was in the cave) cannot be true. Therefore, we can infer that 'The bear was not in the cave'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
