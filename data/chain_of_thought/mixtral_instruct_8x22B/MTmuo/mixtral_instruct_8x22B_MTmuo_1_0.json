            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding' implies that Sue's presence at the wedding is not necessary or certain. However, the second statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding' is a conditional statement that establishes a necessary condition for Sue's presence at the wedding: if Mary was there, then Sue must have been there as well.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that if Sue was not necessarily at the wedding, then the condition for her presence (Mary being at the wedding) must not have been met. This is because if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there too, which contradicts the first statement that Sue's presence was not necessary. Therefore, the only way to resolve this contradiction is to conclude that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
