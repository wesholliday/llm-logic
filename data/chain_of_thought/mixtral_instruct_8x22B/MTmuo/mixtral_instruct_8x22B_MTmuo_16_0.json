            "content": " Explanation: We have two statements that can be analyzed logically. The first statement is a negation of a conditional statement, which can be written as \"~(Shirt is cotton -> Pants are denim)\". This statement is true when the antecedent (Shirt is cotton) is true and the consequent (Pants are denim) is false. In other words, it means that there is a possibility that the shirt is cotton and the pants are not denim.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, \"Shirt is cotton -> Pants are denim\". This statement is true when the antecedent (Shirt is cotton) is false or the consequent (Pants are denim) is true. However, since we know from the first statement that it's not the case that the pants must have been denim, the consequent is false. Therefore, for the second statement to be true, the antecedent must be false. This means that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
