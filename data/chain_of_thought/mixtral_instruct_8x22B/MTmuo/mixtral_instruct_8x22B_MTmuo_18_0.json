            "content": " Explanation: We have two statements that can be analyzed logically:\n1. It's not the case that the truck must have been metal. This can be interpreted as \"The truck might not have been metal\" or \"It is not necessarily true that the truck was metal.\"\n2. If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. This is a conditional statement where the hypothesis is \"the doll was plastic\" and the conclusion is \"the truck must have been metal.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the truck might not have been metal. However, this does not directly tell us anything about the material of the doll.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. But since we know from the first statement that the truck might not have been metal, it means that the hypothesis of the second statement (the doll was plastic) cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
