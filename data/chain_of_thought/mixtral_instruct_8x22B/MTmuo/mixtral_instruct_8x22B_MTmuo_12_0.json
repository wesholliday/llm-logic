            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo' implies that Lucy going to the zoo is not a necessary condition. However, the second statement 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo' sets up a conditional where Joe going to the park is a sufficient condition for Lucy to have gone to the zoo. Since we know that Lucy going to the zoo is not a necessary condition (from the first statement), it means that the sufficient condition (Joe going to the park) did not occur. Therefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
