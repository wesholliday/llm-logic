            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument that can be analyzed using the principles of deductive reasoning. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement (if-then statement) and the negation of its consequent. The conditional statement is \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\" The negation of its consequent is \"The zinger was not smoogled.\" According to the principle of contrapositive, if a conditional statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. The contrapositive of the given conditional statement is \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled.\" Since the negation of the consequent is given as true, we can infer that the contrapositive is also true, and thus, we can infer that \"The zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
