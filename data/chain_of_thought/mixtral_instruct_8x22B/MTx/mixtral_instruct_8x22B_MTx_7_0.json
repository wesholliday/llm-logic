            "content": " Explanation: This problem can be solved using logical reasoning and the concept of contrapositive in logic. The original statement is \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked.\" In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nGiven that \"The whiffle did not tink\" is true, we can apply the contrapositive to infer that \"The whiffle was not shanked\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
