            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument that can be analyzed using the principles of deductive reasoning and the concept of contrapositive. The original statement is \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled,\" which can be written in a more formal logical form as \"Blimmed(flugel) implies Zargled(flugel).\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"Not Zargled(flugel) implies Not Blimmed(flugel).\" In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nGiven the additional information that \"The flugel was not zargled,\" we can apply the contrapositive of the original statement to infer that \"The flugel was not blimmed.\" This is because the contrapositive allows us to conclude that if the consequent of the original statement is false (i.e., the flugel was not zargled), then the antecedent must also be false (i.e., the flugel was not blimmed).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
