            "content": " Explanation: This problem can be solved using logical reasoning and the concept of contrapositive in logic. The original statement is \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\" In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nGiven that the shank was not nugged, we can use the contrapositive to infer that the shank was not plooked. This is because if the shank had been plooked, then according to the original statement, it would have been nugged, which contradicts the given information that the shank was not nugged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
