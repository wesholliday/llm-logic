            "content": " Explanation: This is a logical reasoning problem that can be solved using the concept of contrapositive in logic. The original statement is \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\" In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nWe are given that \"The grommet did not plop the frink,\" which is the condition part of the contrapositive. Therefore, according to the contrapositive, we can infer that \"The grommet was not sploffed,\" which is the conclusion part of the contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
