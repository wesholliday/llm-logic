            "content": " Explanation: This is a logical reasoning problem that can be solved using the rules of logic. The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be written as \"If P then Q\", where P is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and Q is \"the fribble crinked\". The second statement is the negation of Q, which is \"The fribble did not crink\". According to the rules of logic, if a conditional statement is true and its consequent (Q) is false, then its antecedent (P) must also be false. Therefore, we can infer that \"The fribble was not snurgled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
