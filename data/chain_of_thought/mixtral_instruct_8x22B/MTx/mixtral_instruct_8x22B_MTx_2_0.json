            "content": " Explanation: This question involves the use of logical reasoning and the concept of contrapositive in logic. The first statement can be rewritten in the form of an if-then statement: \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\" The contrapositive of an if-then statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nGiven the second statement, \"The wug did not bim the zoint,\" we can apply the contrapositive to infer that \"The wug was not flooped.\" This is because if the consequent of the original statement is false (the wug did not bim the zoint), then the antecedent must also be false (the wug was not flooped).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
