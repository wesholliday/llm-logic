            "content": " Explanation: The statements given are in a form that resembles a logical argument. The first statement is a conditional \"if-then\" statement, which can be symbolized as \"If P then Q,\" where P is \"the sneg was crampled\" and Q is \"the sneg sproted the frink.\" The second statement is the negation of Q, which can be symbolized as \"Not Q.\"\n\nIn logic, the given statements form what is known as a form of argument called \"Modus Tollens,\" which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must be false. In other words, if \"If P then Q\" is true, and \"Not Q\" is true, then \"Not P\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
