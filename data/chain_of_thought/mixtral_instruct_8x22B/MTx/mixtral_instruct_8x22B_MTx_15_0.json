            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of logical reasoning using the concept of contrapositive. The original statement is \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\" In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Given that \"The dreb was not spened\" is true, we can infer that \"The dreb was not vroombed\" is also true by applying the contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
