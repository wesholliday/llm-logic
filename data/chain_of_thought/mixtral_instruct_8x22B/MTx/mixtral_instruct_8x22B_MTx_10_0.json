            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of logical reasoning using a conditional statement. The statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" is a conditional statement, where \"the wug was sproinged\" is the hypothesis and \"it was garpled\" is the conclusion. The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged\". According to the rules of logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning they convey the same information. Given the second statement \"The wug was not garpled\", we can apply the contrapositive to infer that \"The wug was not sproinged\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
