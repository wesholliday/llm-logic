            "content": " Explanation: This is a logical reasoning problem that can be solved using the concept of modus tollens, which is a valid argument form in classical logic. The argument form is as follows: If P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P. In this case, \"The splat was morphed\" is P, and \"The splat quanked\" is Q. The statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" is a conditional statement, and \"The splat did not quank\" is the negation of Q. According to the principle of modus tollens, if the conditional statement is true and the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must be false. Therefore, we can infer that \"The splat was not morphed\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
