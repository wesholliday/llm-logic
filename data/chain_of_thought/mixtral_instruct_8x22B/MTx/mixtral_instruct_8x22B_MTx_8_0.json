            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of logical reasoning using the concept of contrapositive in logic. The original statement is \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\" In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Given that the sprocket was not daggled, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked by applying the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
