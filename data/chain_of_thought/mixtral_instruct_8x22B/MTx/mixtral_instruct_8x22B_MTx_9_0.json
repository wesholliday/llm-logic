The original statement is \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the twonk was not varnished, then it was not plinked.\" In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nGiven that \"The twonk was not varnished,\" we can apply the contrapositive of the original statement to conclude that \"The twonk was not plinked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
