            "content": " Explanation: This is a logical reasoning problem that can be solved using the rules of logic. The statement 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned' is a conditional statement, also known as a 'if-then' statement. In this case, 'the fleeg was bluttered' is the hypothesis, and 'it surned' is the conclusion. The second statement is 'The fleeg did not surn', which is the negation of the conclusion in the conditional statement. According to the rule of logic known as modus tollens, if a statement has the form 'If P, then Q' and the negation of Q is true, then the negation of P is also true. In this case, P is 'the fleeg was bluttered' and Q is 'it surned'. Since the negation of Q is true (the fleeg did not surn), it follows that the negation of P is also true (the fleeg was not bluttered).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
