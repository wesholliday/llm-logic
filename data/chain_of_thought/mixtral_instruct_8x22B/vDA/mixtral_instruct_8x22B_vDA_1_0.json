            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a hypothetical syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that consists of two premises and a conclusion. The first premise is a conditional statement (if-then), and the second premise is a negation of the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional statement.\n\nThe first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This means that if the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequent (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true. However, the second premise states that Mary was not at the wedding, which means that the antecedent is false.\n\nIn a hypothetical syllogism, if the antecedent of the conditional statement is false, then the truth value of the consequent is unknown. This means that we cannot determine whether Sue was at the wedding or not based solely on the information given in the premises. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
