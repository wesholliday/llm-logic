            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical construct known as denying the antecedent. The first premise is a conditional statement (if P, then Q), the second premise is the negation of the antecedent (not P), and the conclusion is the negation of the consequent (not Q). In this case, P is 'Jeff played basketball', Q is 'Amy played tennis', not P is 'Jeff did not play basketball', and not Q is 'Amy did not play tennis'.\n\nThe fallacy of denying the antecedent occurs when it is assumed that if the antecedent (P) is false, then the consequent (Q) must also be false. However, this is not a valid logical inference. The truth of the consequent depends on the truth of the entire conditional statement, not just the truth of the antecedent. In other words, even if Jeff did not play basketball, it does not necessarily mean that Amy did not play tennis.\n\nAnswer: No, this form of argument is not logically valid.",
