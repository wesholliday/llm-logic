            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical construct known as \"denying the antecedent\". The first premise is a conditional statement, \"If P then Q\", where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow\". The second premise is the negation of P, \"the apple was not red\". The conclusion is the negation of Q, \"the banana was not yellow\". In a logically valid argument, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. However, in the case of \"denying the antecedent\", the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. It is possible that the banana could still be yellow even if the apple is not red, because the color of the banana is not necessarily dependent on the color of the apple. Therefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
