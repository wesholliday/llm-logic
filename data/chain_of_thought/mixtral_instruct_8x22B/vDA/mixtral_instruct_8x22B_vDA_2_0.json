            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical construct known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P is false. In this case, P is 'The griffin was in the forest' and Q is 'The unicorn was in the forest'. The first premise states that if P is true, then Q is true. The second premise states that P is false. According to the rule of modus tollens, if P is false, then Q must also be false. Therefore, the conclusion 'The unicorn was not in the forest' is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
