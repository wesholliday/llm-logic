            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical construct known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P is false. In this case, P is 'the doll was plastic' and Q is 'the truck was metal'. The first premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. The second premise states that the doll was not plastic, which means that the antecedent (P) is false. According to the rule of modus tollens, if the antecedent is false, then the consequent (Q) must also be false. Therefore, the conclusion that the truck was not metal is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
