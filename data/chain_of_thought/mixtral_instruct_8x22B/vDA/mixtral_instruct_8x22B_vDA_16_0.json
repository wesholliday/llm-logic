            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical construct known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P is false. In this case, P is 'the shirt was cotton' and Q is 'the pants were denim'. The first premise states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. The second premise states that the shirt was not cotton, which is equivalent to saying that the statement 'the shirt was cotton' is false. According to the rule of modus tollens, if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
