            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical structure known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P is false. In this case, P is 'The vampire was awake' and Q is 'The mummy was awake'. The first premise states that if P is true, then Q is true. The second premise states that P is false. Therefore, according to the rule of modus tollens, the conclusion that Q is false (The mummy was not awake) is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
