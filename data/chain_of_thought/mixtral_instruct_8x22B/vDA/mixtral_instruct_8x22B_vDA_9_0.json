            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical construct known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens has the following structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and Q is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. The first premise is 'If P, then Q', the second premise is 'Not Q' (Lisa did not buy the red shirt), and the conclusion is 'Therefore, not P' (Mark did not buy the blue shirt).\n\nHowever, the conclusion drawn in this argument does not follow the structure of modus tollens. The valid conclusion should be 'Therefore, not P', which in this case would be 'Therefore, Lisa did not buy the red shirt'. The given conclusion 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt' is not logically valid based on the premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
