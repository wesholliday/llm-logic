            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical construct known as \"modus tollens,\" which is a valid form of argument. The first premise is a conditional statement (if P, then Q), the second premise is the negation of the antecedent (not P), and the conclusion is the negation of the consequent (not Q). In this case, the first premise is \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue,\" the second premise is \"The car was not red,\" and the conclusion is \"The truck was not blue.\" Since the argument follows the form of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
