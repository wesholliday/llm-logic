            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical structure known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. The first premise is a conditional statement (if P, then Q), the second premise is the negation of the consequent (not Q), and the conclusion is the negation of the antecedent (not P). In this case, P is 'the dog was inside' and Q is 'the cat was outside'. The argument states that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. The second premise states that the dog was not inside. According to the rules of logic, if a conditional statement is true and the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false. Therefore, if the dog was not inside, then it cannot be true that the cat was outside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
