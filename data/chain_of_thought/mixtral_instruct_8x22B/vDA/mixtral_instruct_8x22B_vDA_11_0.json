            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical construct known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P is false. In this case, P is 'the cake was chocolate' and Q is 'the muffins were blueberry'. The first premise states that if P is true, then Q is true. The second premise states that P is false. According to modus tollens, if P is false, then Q must also be false. Therefore, the conclusion 'the muffins were not blueberry' follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
