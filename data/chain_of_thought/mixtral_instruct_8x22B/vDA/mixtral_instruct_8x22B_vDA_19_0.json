            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical construct known as denying the antecedent. The first premise is a conditional statement (if P then Q), the second premise is the negation of the antecedent (not P), and the conclusion is the negation of the consequent (not Q). In this case, P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball\".\n\nIn a logically valid argument, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. However, in the case of denying the antecedent, the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. This is because the conditional statement \"If P then Q\" does not imply that Q cannot be true if P is false. In other words, just because Tom did not watch football does not mean that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
