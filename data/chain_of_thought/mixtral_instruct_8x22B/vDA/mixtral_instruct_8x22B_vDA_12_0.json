            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical construct known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P is false. In this case, P is 'Joe went to the park' and Q is 'Lucy went to the zoo'. The first premise is 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo', which is the same as saying 'P implies Q'. The second premise is 'Joe did not go to the park', which is the same as saying 'P is false'. The conclusion is 'Lucy did not go to the zoo', which is the same as saying 'Q is false'. According to the rule of modus tollens, if P implies Q and P is false, then Q is false. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
