            "content": " Explanation: This argument is not logically valid. The original premise is a conditional statement (if P, then Q) where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel\". The conclusion attempts to form the contrapositive of the original statement, but it is not equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of the original statement would be \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James\". However, the conclusion provided in the argument is \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel\", which is not logically equivalent to the original statement or its contrapositive. This argument commits the logical fallacy of denying the antecedent.\n\nAnswer: No.",
