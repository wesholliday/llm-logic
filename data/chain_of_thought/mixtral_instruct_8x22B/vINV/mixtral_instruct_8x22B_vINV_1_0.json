            "content": " Explanation: This argument is not logically valid. The original premise states that if one condition is true (Mary was at the wedding), then another condition is also true (Sue was at the wedding). However, the conclusion attempts to establish a relationship between the negation of the first condition (Mary was not at the wedding) and the negation of the second condition (Sue was not at the wedding). This is a logical fallacy known as denying the antecedent. The original premise does not provide enough information to conclude that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was also not at the wedding. It's possible that Sue was at the wedding regardless of whether Mary was there or not.\n\nAnswer: No.",
