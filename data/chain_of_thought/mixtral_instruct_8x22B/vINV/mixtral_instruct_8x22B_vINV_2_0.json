            "content": " Explanation: The argument is not logically valid. The original premise is a conditional statement that says if P then Q, where P is \"the griffin was in the forest\" and Q is \"the unicorn was in the forest\". The conclusion, however, is the contrapositive of the original statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the conclusion is not a direct inference from the given premise. The contrapositive of the original statement is \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\", which is not the same as the given conclusion. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
