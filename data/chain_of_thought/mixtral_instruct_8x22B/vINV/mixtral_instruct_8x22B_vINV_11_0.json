The original premise states that if one condition is true (the cake being chocolate), then another condition is true (the muffins being blueberry). However, it does not state that if the first condition is not true (the cake not being chocolate), then the second condition is not true (the muffins not being blueberry). This is a logical fallacy known as denying the antecedent.\n\nAnswer: No.",
