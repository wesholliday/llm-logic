            "content": " Explanation: This argument is not logically valid. The original premise is a conditional statement (if P, then Q), where P is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and Q is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. The conclusion attempts to form the contrapositive of the original statement, but it is incorrectly stated. The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. Therefore, the correct contrapositive of the original statement would be 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt'. The conclusion in the argument incorrectly states the negation of the original premise, which is a logical fallacy.\n\nAnswer: No.",
