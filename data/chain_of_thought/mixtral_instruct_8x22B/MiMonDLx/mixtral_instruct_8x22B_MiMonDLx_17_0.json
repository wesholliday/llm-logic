When we say 'might be', we are indicating that there is a chance that the zibber is wozzle flim, but it could also be something else. Therefore, it is also possible that 'The zibber might be wozzle flim or quibble frazzle fribble'. This is because the original statement does not exclude the possibility of the zibber being something else in addition to wozzle flim.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
