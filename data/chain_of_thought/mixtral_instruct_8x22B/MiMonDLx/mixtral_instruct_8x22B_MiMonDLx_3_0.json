However, this statement does not provide any information about the zooble's location in relation to the quorple. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that 'The zooble might be in the plimp or on the quorple' based solely on the given statement. The possibility of the zooble being on the quorple is not suggested or implied in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
