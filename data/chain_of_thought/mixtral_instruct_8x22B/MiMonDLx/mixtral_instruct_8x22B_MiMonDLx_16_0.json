When we say 'The zibber might be froodle or on wibble', we are expanding the possibilities, not changing the original statement. This new statement still includes the original possibility that 'The zibber might be froodle', but also adds another possibility that 'The zibber might be on wibble'. Therefore, the original statement can be inferred in the expanded statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
