            "content": " Explanation: In logic, the principle of addition allows us to add disjuncts (or additional options) to a statement without changing its truth value. In this case, the original statement is \"The quibble might be blurble,\" which can be interpreted as \"It is possible that the quibble is blurble.\" By adding the disjunct \"or plimp,\" we are simply adding another possibility without negating the original statement. Therefore, we can infer that \"The quibble might be blurble or plimp\" is a valid statement that does not contradict the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
