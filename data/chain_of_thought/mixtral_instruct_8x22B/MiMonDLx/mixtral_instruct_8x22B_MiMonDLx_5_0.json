When we add 'or snork' to the statement, we are introducing another possibility without negating the original possibility. Therefore, the statement 'The zibble might be wozzle or snork' is a logical extension of the original statement, as it maintains the original possibility and adds a new one.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
