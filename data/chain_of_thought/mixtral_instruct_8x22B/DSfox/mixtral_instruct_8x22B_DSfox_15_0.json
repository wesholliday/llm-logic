            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The dreb is not spened' is given, and we also have the statement 'Either the dreb is spened or it is vroombed'. This is a classic example of logical disjunction, where two statements are connected by 'or'. In this case, the disjunction is exclusive, meaning only one of the two statements can be true at any given time. Since we know that 'The dreb is not spened', we can infer that the other option must be true, which is 'The dreb is vroombed'. This is based on the logical principle of excluded middle, which states that for any proposition, either that proposition is true or its negation is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
