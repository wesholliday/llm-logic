            "content": " Explanation: This problem can be solved using logical reasoning and the concept of disjunction (OR) in logic. The statement 'Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked' is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. The first statement 'The sprocket is not daggled' tells us that one of the conditions in the disjunction is false. Since a disjunction is true if at least one of its conditions is true, and we know that 'the sprocket is daggled' is false, then 'the sprocket is cranked' must be true for the disjunction to hold true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
