These statements are in a form that resembles the law of excluded middle in logic, which states that for any proposition, either that proposition is true or its negation is true. In this case, the two options for the whiffle are being tinked or being shanked.\n\nGiven that the whiffle is not tinked, and the only other option provided is that it is shanked, we can infer that the whiffle must be shanked. This is a form of disjunctive syllogism, where we have two options (the whiffle is tinked or shanked), we know one option is not the case (the whiffle is not tinked), and therefore we can conclude that the remaining option must be the case (the whiffle is shanked).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
