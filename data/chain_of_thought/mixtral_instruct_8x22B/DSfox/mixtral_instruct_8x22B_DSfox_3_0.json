The splat is not quanked.\n2. Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the splat is not in the state of being quanked.\n\nThe second statement is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions (the splat is quanked or the splat is morphed) must be true. Since we know from the first statement that the splat is not quanked, the only remaining possibility is that the splat is morphed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
