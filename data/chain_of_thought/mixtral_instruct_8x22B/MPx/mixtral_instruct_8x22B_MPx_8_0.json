            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument that follows the form of Modus Ponens, which is a valid argument form in classical logic. The argument can be broken down into two premises and a conclusion. The first premise is 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled', which is a conditional statement (also known as an 'if-then' statement). The second premise is 'The sprocket was cranked', which is an assertion that the condition in the first premise has been met. From these two premises, we can infer the conclusion 'The sprocket was daggled'. This is because the first premise tells us that whenever the sprocket is cranked, it will be daggled. The second premise tells us that the sprocket was indeed cranked. Therefore, we can conclude that the sprocket was daggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
