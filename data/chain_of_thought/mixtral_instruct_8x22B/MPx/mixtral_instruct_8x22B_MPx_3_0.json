            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument that uses a rule and a fact to draw a conclusion. The rule is 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked'. This is a conditional statement, also known as an 'if-then' statement, where 'the splat was morphed' is the hypothesis and 'the splat quanked' is the conclusion. The fact given is 'The splat was morphed', which matches the hypothesis of the rule. In logic, when the hypothesis of a conditional statement is true, the conclusion also has to be true. Therefore, we can infer that 'The splat quanked'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
