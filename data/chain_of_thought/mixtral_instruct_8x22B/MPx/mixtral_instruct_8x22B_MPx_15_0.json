            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument that follows the rule of inference known as modus ponens. Modus ponens states that if P implies Q, and P is true, then Q must also be true. In this case, 'The dreb was vroombed' is P, and 'The dreb was spened' is Q. The first statement, 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened', is the implication that P implies Q. The second statement, 'The dreb was vroombed', is the assertion that P is true. Therefore, according to the rule of modus ponens, we can infer that Q, 'The dreb was spened', is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
