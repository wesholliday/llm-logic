            "content": " Explanation: This question is based on the logical rule of inference known as modus ponens, which states that if P implies Q, and P is true, then Q must also be true. In this case, P is 'The grommet was sploffed' and Q is 'The grommet plopped the frink'. The first statement, 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink', is a conditional statement that establishes the relationship between P and Q. The second statement, 'The grommet was sploffed', is an assertion that P is true. Therefore, according to the rule of modus ponens, we can infer that Q, 'The grommet plopped the frink', is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
