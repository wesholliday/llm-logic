            "content": " Explanation: This problem can be solved using the concept of logical implication in propositional logic. The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is a conditional statement, where \"Joe went to the park\" is the hypothesis (or antecedent), and \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is the conclusion (or consequent). If the hypothesis is true, then the conclusion must also be true for the conditional statement to hold. In this case, we are given that Joe went to the park, which makes the hypothesis true. Therefore, we can infer that Lucy went to the zoo, as the conditional statement is true and the hypothesis is satisfied.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
