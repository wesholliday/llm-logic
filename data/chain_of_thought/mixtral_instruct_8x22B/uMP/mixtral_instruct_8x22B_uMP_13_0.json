            "content": " Explanation: We have two statements here. The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be written as \"If P then Q,\" where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\" The second statement is an assertion that P is true, i.e., \"the car was red.\" In logic, if a conditional statement is true and its hypothesis (P) is also true, then the conclusion (Q) must be true. This is known as modus ponens, a valid argument in classical logic. Therefore, we can infer that the truck was blue.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
