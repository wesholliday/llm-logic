            "content": " Explanation: This problem can be solved using the concept of logical implication. The statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is a conditional statement, where \"the vampire was awake\" is the hypothesis and \"the mummy was awake\" is the conclusion. If the hypothesis is true, then the conclusion must also be true. In this case, we are given that the hypothesis is true (the vampire was awake). Therefore, according to the conditional statement, the conclusion must also be true, which means the mummy was awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
