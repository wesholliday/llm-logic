            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements: 1) If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim; and 2) The shirt was cotton. Since the first statement is a conditional statement (if-then), and the condition (the shirt was cotton) is true, we can infer that the conclusion (the pants were denim) is also true. This is based on the logical rule of inference known as modus ponens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and its hypothesis is true, then its conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
