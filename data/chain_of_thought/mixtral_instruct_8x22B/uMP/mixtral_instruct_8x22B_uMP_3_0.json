From these statements, we can infer that the book is a mystery novel. This is because the first statement is a conditional statement (if-then), and the second statement provides the condition for the first statement (the book was written by James). Therefore, the conclusion (the book is a mystery novel) follows logically from the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
