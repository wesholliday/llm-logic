This means that if the first part of the statement (the hypothesis) is true, then the second part of the statement (the conclusion) must also be true. In this case, the hypothesis is \"Sue chose pizza,\" and the conclusion is \"Bob chose pasta.\" Since we are given that Sue did indeed choose pizza, we can infer that the hypothesis is true. Therefore, according to the conditional statement, the conclusion must also be true, which means that Bob chose pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
