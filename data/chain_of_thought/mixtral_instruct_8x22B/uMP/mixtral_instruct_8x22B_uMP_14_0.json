            "content": " Explanation: We have two statements here. The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be written as \"If P then Q,\" where P is \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q is \"the wolf was in the den.\" The second statement is \"P,\" which is \"the bear was in the cave.\" In logic, this is called modus ponens, a valid argument where if the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true. Since we know that the bear was in the cave (P is true), we can infer that the wolf was in the den (Q is true).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
