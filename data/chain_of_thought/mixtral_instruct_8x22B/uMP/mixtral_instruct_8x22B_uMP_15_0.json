            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is a conditional statement. In a conditional statement, if the first part (the hypothesis) is true, then the second part (the conclusion) must also be true. In this case, the hypothesis is \"Sam took a plane,\" and the conclusion is \"Erin took a train.\" Since we know that Sam took a plane (this is given as a fact), we can infer that the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, we can infer that Erin took a train.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
