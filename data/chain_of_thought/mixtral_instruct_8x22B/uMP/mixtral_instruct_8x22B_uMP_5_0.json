            "content": " Explanation: This logical statement is in the form of a conditional statement, which is \"If P, then Q.\" In this case, P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\" The statement also tells us that P is true, as Jeff indeed played basketball. In a conditional statement, if the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true. Therefore, since Jeff played basketball (P is true), we can infer that Amy played tennis (Q is true).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
