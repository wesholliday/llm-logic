This means that if the condition (the griffin being in the forest) is true, then the conclusion (the unicorn being in the forest) must also be true. Since it is given that the griffin was indeed in the forest, we can infer that the condition of the conditional statement is met. Therefore, according to the rules of logic, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
