            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements: (1) If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry; and (2) The cake was chocolate. From statement (2), we know that the condition for statement (1) is true. Therefore, we can apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of a conditional statement is true, then the consequent (the \"then\" part) must also be true. In this case, the antecedent is \"the cake was chocolate,\" and the consequent is \"the muffins were blueberry.\" Since the antecedent is true, we can infer that the consequent is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
