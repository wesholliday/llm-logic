            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements: 1) If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal, and 2) The doll was plastic. These statements form a logical argument known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. In modus ponens, if the first statement (also known as the premise or hypothesis) is true, and the second statement (also known as the condition or antecedent) is also true, then the conclusion (also known as the consequence or consequent) must be true. In this case, the first statement is the premise, the second statement is the condition, and the conclusion is that the truck was metal. Since both the premise and the condition are true, we can infer that the conclusion is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
