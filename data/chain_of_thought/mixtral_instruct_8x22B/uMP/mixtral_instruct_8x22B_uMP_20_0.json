            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements: 1) If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow, and 2) The apple was red. These statements form a logical argument known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. In modus ponens, if the first statement (also called the premise or hypothesis) is true, and the second statement (also called the condition) is also true, then the conclusion must be true. In this case, the first statement is the premise, and the second statement confirms the condition. Therefore, we can infer that the conclusion, \"the banana was yellow,\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
