The statement \"The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack\" eliminates one of those possibilities. However, this does not definitively confirm that the scarf is in the backpack. It could be in another location not mentioned in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack\" based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
