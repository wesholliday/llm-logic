            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table\" is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. The statement \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch\" negates one of the conditions. Therefore, by the process of elimination, we can infer that the remaining condition must be true. In this case, the only remaining possibility is that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
