            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The wozzle might be in zooble or gribble' suggests that there are two possible locations for the wozzle: zooble and gribble. The use of 'or' indicates that the wozzle could be in either one of these locations, but not necessarily both. Therefore, it is valid to infer that 'The wozzle might be in zooble' because zooble is one of the possible locations mentioned in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
