            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that the splat must be quanked' is a negation of the first part of the second statement 'Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed'. This means that the first part of the second statement is false, which leaves us with the second part of the statement 'it is morphed' as the only possible truth. This is based on the logical principle of disjunctive syllogism, which states that if we have a statement of the form 'A or B' and we know that 'A' is false, then 'B' must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
