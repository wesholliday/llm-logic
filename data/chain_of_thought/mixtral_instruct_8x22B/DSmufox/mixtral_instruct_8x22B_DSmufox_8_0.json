            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled' is a negation of the statement 'The sprocket must be daggled'. This means that the sprocket does not have to be daggled. The second statement 'Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked' is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. Since we know from the first statement that the sprocket does not have to be daggled, the only remaining possibility is that the sprocket is cranked. Therefore, we can infer that 'The sprocket is cranked'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
