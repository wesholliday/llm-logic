            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' is a conditional statement, also known as a material implication. In this case, 'Joe went to the park' is the hypothesis, and 'Lucy went to the zoo' is the conclusion. The statement is only false when the hypothesis is true, and the conclusion is false. In other words, if Joe went to the park, but Lucy did not go to the zoo, the statement would be false. However, if Joe did not go to the park, the statement is considered true regardless of whether Lucy went to the zoo or not. This is because the condition for the statement to be true (Joe going to the park) was not met, so we cannot determine the truth of the conclusion based on this statement alone. Given that we know 'Joe did not go to the park', we cannot infer whether Lucy went to the zoo or not based on the conditional statement. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Lucy did not go to the zoo' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
