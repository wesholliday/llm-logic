            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' is a conditional statement, also known as a logical implication. This statement does not imply that the muffins can only be blueberry if the cake is chocolate. It only states that if the condition (the cake being chocolate) is true, then the consequence (the muffins being blueberry) is also true. However, if the condition is not met (the cake is not chocolate), the statement does not provide any information about the muffins. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The muffins were not blueberry' based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: No.",
