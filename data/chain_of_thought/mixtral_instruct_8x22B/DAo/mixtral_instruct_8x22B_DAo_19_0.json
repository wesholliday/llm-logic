            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' is a conditional statement, also known as a material implication. This means that if the first part (the antecedent, 'Tom watched football') is true, then the second part (the consequent, 'Jen watched basketball') must also be true. However, if the antecedent is false (as in this case, 'Tom did not watch football'), the conditional statement tells us nothing about the truth or falsity of the consequent. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'Jen did not watch basketball' based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: No.",
