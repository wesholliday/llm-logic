            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim' is a conditional statement, where 'the shirt was cotton' is the hypothesis and 'the pants were denim' is the conclusion. The negation of a conditional statement is not the negation of the conclusion, but the negation of the entire statement, which would be 'If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim'. However, this is not the case we are given. We are given that 'The shirt was not cotton', which is the negation of the hypothesis, but this does not necessarily imply the negation of the conclusion. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The pants were not denim' based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
