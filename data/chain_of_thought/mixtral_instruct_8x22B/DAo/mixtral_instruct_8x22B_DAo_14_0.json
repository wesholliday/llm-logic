            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den' is a conditional statement, where 'the bear was in the cave' is the hypothesis and 'the wolf was in the den' is the conclusion. However, the hypothesis is negated by the statement 'The bear was not in the cave'. In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. The contrapositive of the given conditional statement is 'If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave'. Since we know that the bear was not in the cave, we cannot infer that the wolf was not in the den based solely on these statements. The location of the wolf is not determined by the location of the bear in this case, because the bear not being in the cave does not affect the wolf's location.\n\nAnswer: No.",
