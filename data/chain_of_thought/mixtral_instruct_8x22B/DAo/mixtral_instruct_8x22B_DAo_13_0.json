            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The car was not red' is the negation of the condition in the second statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'. In logic, if the condition of an 'if-then' statement is false, the statement itself is considered to be true, regardless of the truth value of the conclusion. This is known as the principle of vacuous truth. Therefore, the statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' is considered to be true, but this does not provide any information about the color of the truck. The color of the truck could be blue, or it could be any other color. The only thing we know for sure is that the color of the truck does not depend on the color of the car, because the car is not red.\n\nAnswer: No.",
