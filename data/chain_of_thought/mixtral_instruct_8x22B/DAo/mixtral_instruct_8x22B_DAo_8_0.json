            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The vampire was not awake' contradicts the condition 'If the vampire was awake' in the second statement. Since the vampire was not awake, the condition for the mummy to be awake (which is the vampire being awake) is not met. Therefore, we cannot infer that the mummy was awake. However, the statement does not provide any information about the mummy's state when the vampire is not awake. It only tells us that if the vampire were awake, then the mummy would be awake. Since the vampire is not awake, the mummy could be awake or not awake.\n\nAnswer: No.",
