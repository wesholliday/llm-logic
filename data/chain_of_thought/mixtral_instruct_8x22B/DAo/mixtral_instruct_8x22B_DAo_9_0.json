            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement, where 'Lisa bought the red shirt' is the hypothesis and 'Mark bought the blue shirt' is the conclusion. The negation of a conditional statement is not the negation of the conclusion alone, but the statement that the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false. In this case, the negation would be 'Lisa bought the red shirt and Mark did not buy the blue shirt'. However, we are given that 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt', which means the hypothesis of the conditional statement is false. When the hypothesis of a conditional statement is false, the statement as a whole is considered true, regardless of the truth value of the conclusion. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
