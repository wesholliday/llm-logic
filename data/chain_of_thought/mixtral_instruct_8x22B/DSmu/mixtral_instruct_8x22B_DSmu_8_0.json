            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two propositions must be true. The second statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" is a negation of one of the propositions in the disjunction. Since the disjunction is true and one of the propositions is false, the other proposition must be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
