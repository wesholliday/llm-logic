            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist\" presents two possibilities for the location of the watch. The statement \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist\" eliminates one of those possibilities. Therefore, by process of elimination, we can infer that the remaining possibility is true. This means that if the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
