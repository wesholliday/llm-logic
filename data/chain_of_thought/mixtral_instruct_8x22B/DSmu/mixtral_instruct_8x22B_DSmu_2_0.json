            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table' is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. The statement 'It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table' negates one of the conditions in the disjunction. Since the disjunction requires at least one condition to be true, and we know that the book is not resting on the table, we can infer that the remaining condition must be true. Therefore, we can infer that 'The book is on the shelf'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
