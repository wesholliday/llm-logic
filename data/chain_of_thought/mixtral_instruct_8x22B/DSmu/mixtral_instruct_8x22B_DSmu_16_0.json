The second statement \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk\" is a negation of one of the propositions in the disjunction. Since the disjunction is true and one of the propositions is false, the other proposition must be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The pen is in my bag\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
