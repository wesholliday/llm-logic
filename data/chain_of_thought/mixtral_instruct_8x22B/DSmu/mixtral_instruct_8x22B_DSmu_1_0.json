            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two propositions must be true. The second statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" is the negation of one of the disjuncts in the first statement. Since the negation of one disjunct is true, it follows that the other disjunct must be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"Fido is inside\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
