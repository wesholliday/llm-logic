            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of a logical operation called disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid argument form. The statement \"Either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer\" is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two options must be true. The statement \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet\" is the negation of one of the disjuncts. In a disjunctive syllogism, if one of the disjuncts is denied, then the other must be true. Therefore, if the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, they must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
