            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of a logical operation called disjunctive syllogism, where we have a statement in the form of \"either A or B\" and then we learn that \"not A\" is true. From this, we can infer that \"B\" must be true. In this case, \"A\" is \"the cookies are hidden in the pantry\" and \"B\" is \"the cookies are in the jar\". Since we know that \"the cookies aren't hidden in the pantry\" (not A), we can infer that \"the cookies are in the jar\" (B).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
