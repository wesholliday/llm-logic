            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"Either the remote control is hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table\" is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two propositions must be true. The two propositions are \"The remote control is hiding under the couch\" and \"The remote control is on the coffee table\". When we are given the additional information that \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch\", we can infer that the first proposition is false. Since the disjunction must be true, the second proposition must be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
