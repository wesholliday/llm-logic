            "content": " Explanation: This problem can be solved using logical deduction. The statement \"Either the missing sock is under the bed or it's in the laundry basket\" is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two propositions must be true. The statement \"The missing sock isn't under the bed\" negates one of the propositions. Therefore, by the process of elimination, the remaining proposition must be true. This is an example of the logical rule of inference known as disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
