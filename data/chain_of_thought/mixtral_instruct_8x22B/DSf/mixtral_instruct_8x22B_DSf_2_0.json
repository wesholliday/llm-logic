            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'Either the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf' is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two propositions must be true. The two propositions are 'The book is resting on the table' and 'The book is on the shelf'. When we are given the additional information that 'The book isn't resting on the table', we can infer that the first proposition is false. Since the disjunction must be true, the second proposition 'The book is on the shelf' must be true. This is an application of the logical principle known as disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
