            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of the logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" The original statement is a conditional statement, or an \"if-then\" statement, which can be written as \"Mary at wedding -> Sue at wedding.\" The conclusion, however, is a different conditional statement, \"Sue at wedding -> Mary at wedding,\" which is not necessarily true based on the original statement. In other words, just because Mary being at the wedding implies that Sue was also at the wedding, it does not mean that Sue being at the wedding implies that Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No.",
