            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"Either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway\" is a logical disjunction, which means that one or both of the statements must be true. The statement \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch\" is a negation of one of the disjuncts, which means that the other disjunct must be true.
