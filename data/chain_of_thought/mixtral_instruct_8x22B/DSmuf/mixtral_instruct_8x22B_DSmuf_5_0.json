            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar\" is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two propositions must be true. The statement \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" is the negation of one of the disjuncts, which leaves us with the other disjunct as the only possible truth. Therefore, if it's not the case that the cookies are in the pantry, then the only remaining possibility is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
