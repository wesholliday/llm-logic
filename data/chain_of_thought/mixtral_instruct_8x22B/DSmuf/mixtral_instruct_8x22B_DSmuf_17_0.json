            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack\" presents two possibilities for the location of the scarf. The statement \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack\" eliminates the first possibility.
