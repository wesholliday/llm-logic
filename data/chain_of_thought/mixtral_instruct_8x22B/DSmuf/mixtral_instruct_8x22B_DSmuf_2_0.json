            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf\" is a disjunction, meaning that one or both of the propositions must be true. The statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" is a negation of one of the disjuncts, which leaves us with the other disjunct as the only possible truth. Therefore, if the book is not on the table, it must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
