            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"Either the missing sock must be under the bed or it's in the laundry basket\" is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two propositions must be true. The statement \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\" is the negation of one of the disjuncts, which means that the other disjunct must be true.
