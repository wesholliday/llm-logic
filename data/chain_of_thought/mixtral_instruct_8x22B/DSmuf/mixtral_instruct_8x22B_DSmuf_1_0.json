            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside\" is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two propositions must be true. The statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" negates the first proposition of the disjunction. Therefore, the only remaining possibility for the disjunction to be true is that Fido is inside. This is an application of the logical rule of inference called disjunctive syllogism, which states that if we have a disjunction and we know that one of the disjuncts is false, then the other disjunct must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
