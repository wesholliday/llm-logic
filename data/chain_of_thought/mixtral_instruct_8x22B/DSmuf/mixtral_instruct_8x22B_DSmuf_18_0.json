            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer\" is a disjunction, which means that one or both of the statements must be true. The statement \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand\" is a negation of one of the disjuncts, which means that the other disjunct must be true.
