However, the statement 'The fizzle must snizzle at shimble quazzle and gronk at zump wumble' introduces a new action (snizzle) at a new location (shimble quazzle), in addition to the original action and location. Since the original statement does not provide any information about the fizzle snizzling at shimble quazzle, we cannot infer this new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: No.",
