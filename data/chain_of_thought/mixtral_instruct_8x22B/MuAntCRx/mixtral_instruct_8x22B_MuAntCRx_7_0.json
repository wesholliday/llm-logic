The second statement 'The plonk must blimple quibble frozz and frozz floob gronk' introduces new actions ('blimple' and 'quibble') and also repeats the action 'frozz' before the original action 'frozz floob gronk'. Since these new actions and the repetition are not present in the original statement, we cannot directly infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: No.",
