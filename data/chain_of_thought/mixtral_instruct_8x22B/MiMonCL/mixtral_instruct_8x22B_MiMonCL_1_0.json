            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The flibbit might be zorped and gribbled' implies that the flibbit could possibly be both zorped and gribbled at the same time. However, the statement does not exclude the possibility that the flibbit might only be zorped, without being gribbled. Therefore, from the original statement, we can infer that 'The flibbit might be zorped' because this is a possibility that is not contradicted by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
