However, it does not provide any information about the wozzle being in the quazzle. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that the wozzle might be in the quazzle based on the given statement. The phrase 'or in the grooble' is redundant in this context because it is already implied that the wozzle might be in the grooble.\n\nAnswer: No.",
