            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The zibber might be on the wump' suggests that there is a possibility that the zibber is on the wump. When we add 'or on the floob' to the statement, we are expanding the possible locations where the zibber might be. This does not contradict the original statement, but rather includes an additional possibility. Therefore, it is a valid inference to say 'The zibber might be on the floob or on the wump'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
