            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The computer might be broken' implies that there is a possibility that the computer is broken, but it does not provide information about the possibility of the computer being in any other state, such as working. However, in the realm of logic, a statement can be either true or false, and if a statement is not true, then it is false. Therefore, if the computer is not broken, then it must be working. So, the statement 'The computer might be broken or working' is a tautology, meaning it is always true regardless of the state of the computer. This is because it covers all possible states of the computer: broken or not broken (i.e., working).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
