Therefore, we cannot infer 'The food might be spicy or mild' directly from 'The food might be spicy'. The statement 'The food might be spicy or mild' would imply that there is a possibility of the food being either spicy or mild, which is not necessarily true based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
