However, it does not provide any information about the meeting being rescheduled. In logic, we cannot infer additional information that is not provided or implied in the original statement. Therefore, while it is true that the meeting might be cancelled, we cannot infer that it might be rescheduled based solely on this statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
