            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The fribble might not have been snurgled' is a modal statement that expresses possibility. It suggests that there is a possibility that the fribble was not snurgled. On the other hand, 'It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled' is also a modal statement, but it expresses the negation of necessity. It suggests that it is not necessarily true that the fribble was snurgled.\n\nIn modal logic, possibility (might) is the dual of necessity (must). This means that if a statement is possible (it might be true), then its negation is not necessarily false (it's not the case that it must be false). Therefore, if 'The fribble might not have been snurgled' is true, then 'It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled' is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
