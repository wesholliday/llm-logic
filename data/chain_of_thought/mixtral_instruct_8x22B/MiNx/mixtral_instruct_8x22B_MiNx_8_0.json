            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The sprocket might not have been cranked' implies that there is a possibility that the sprocket was not cranked. This means that the action of cranking the sprocket is not certain or necessary, as indicated by the word 'might'. Therefore, it can be inferred that 'It's not the case that the sprocket must have been cranked', because the original statement suggests that the sprocket being cranked is not a definite or required outcome.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
