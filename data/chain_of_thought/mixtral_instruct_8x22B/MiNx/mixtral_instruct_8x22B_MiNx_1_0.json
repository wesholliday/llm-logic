            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"The flugel might not have been blimmed\" implies that there is a possibility that the flugel was not blimmed. This means that the blimming of the flugel is not a certainty, and there is room for doubt or uncertainty. The statement \"It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed\" also implies that the blimming of the flugel is not a certainty, but it does so in a more direct and explicit way. Therefore, the two statements are essentially saying the same thing, but in different ways.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
