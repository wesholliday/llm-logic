            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The dreb might not have been vroombed' implies that there is a possibility that the dreb was not vroombed. This means that the vroombing of the dreb is not a certainty or a necessity. Therefore, it is not the case that the dreb must have been vroombed. The original statement is a possibility claim, while the inferred statement is a necessity claim, but they are negations of each other.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
