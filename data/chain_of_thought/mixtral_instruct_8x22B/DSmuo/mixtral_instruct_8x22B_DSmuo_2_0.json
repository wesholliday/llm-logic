            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table' implies that the book does not necessarily have to be on the table. This does not mean that the book cannot be on the table, but rather that it is not a requirement for the book to be there. The second statement 'Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table' presents two possibilities for the location of the book: either it is on the shelf or it is on the table. Given that the first statement has already established that the book does not have to be on the table, the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf. Therefore, we can infer that 'The book is on the shelf'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
