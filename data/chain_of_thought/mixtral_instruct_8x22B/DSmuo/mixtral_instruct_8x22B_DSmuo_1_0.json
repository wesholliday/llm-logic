            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' can be interpreted as 'Fido does not necessarily have to be in the garden'. This means that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. The second statement 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' gives us two possibilities: either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden. Since we know from the first statement that Fido does not necessarily have to be in the garden, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that Fido is inside. Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
