The logical form of the argument is as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If P, then Q (If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo)\nPremise 2: Q (Lucy went to the zoo)\nConclusion: P (Joe went to the park)\n\nThis is an example of the logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" Just because Lucy went to the zoo (Q), we cannot conclude that Joe went to the park (P) based solely on the first premise. It's possible that Lucy went to the zoo for reasons unrelated to Joe's actions.\n\nAnswer: No.",
