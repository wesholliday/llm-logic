            "content": " Explanation: This argument is not logically valid. The argument is in the form of affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. The first premise states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. The second premise states that the book is a mystery novel. However, this does not necessarily mean that the book was written by James. There could be other authors who also write mystery novels. Therefore, the conclusion that the book was written by James does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
