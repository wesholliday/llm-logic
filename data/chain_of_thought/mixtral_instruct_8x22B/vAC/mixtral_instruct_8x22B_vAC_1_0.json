            "content": " Explanation: This argument is not logically valid. The logical validity of an argument depends on its form, not its content. In this case, the argument is in the form of affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. The first premise is a conditional statement (if P then Q), the second premise affirms the consequent (Q), and the conclusion affirms the antecedent (P). However, just because Q is true, it does not necessarily mean that P is true. In this case, just because Sue was at the wedding, it does not necessarily mean that Mary was at the wedding. It's possible that Sue was at the wedding without Mary.\n\nAnswer: No.",
