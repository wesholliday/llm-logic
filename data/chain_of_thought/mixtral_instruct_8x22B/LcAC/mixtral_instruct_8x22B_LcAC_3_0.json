            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. This statement tells us that if the hypothesis (the book was written by James) is true, then the conclusion (the book is a mystery novel) is also true. However, this does not mean that the reverse is true. In other words, just because the book is a mystery novel, we cannot conclude that it was written by James. There could be other authors who also write mystery novels. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that \"The book was written by James\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
