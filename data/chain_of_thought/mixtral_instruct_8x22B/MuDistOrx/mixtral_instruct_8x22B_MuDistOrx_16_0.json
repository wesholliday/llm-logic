            "content": " Explanation: The original statement and the inferred statement are logically equivalent. Both statements express the same idea using different phrasing. The original statement uses \"must be wump by\" twice, which implies that the blimp has to be wumped by either the frazzle blimple or the plimp. The inferred statement rephrases this idea by saying \"it must be wump by the frazzle blimple or it must be wump by the plimp,\" which also means that the blimp has to be wumped by one of the two options. The use of \"or\" in both statements indicates that the blimp cannot be wumped by both the frazzle blimple and the plimp at the same time, but it must be wumped by one of them.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
