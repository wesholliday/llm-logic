The word 'or' in this context is used to separate these two possibilities. The sentence 'The blimple must be zump or it must be zibber' is simply a restatement of the original sentence, with the second clause made explicit. The meaning of the sentence remains the same, as it still presents the same two possibilities for the blimple.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
