            "content": " Explanation: The given statement \"The snorkel must be flim by quank or be flim by fribble\" is a disjunction, meaning that the snorkel must meet one of the two conditions: being flim by quank or being flim by fribble. The inference \"The snorkel must be flim by quank or it must be flim by fribble\" is a restatement of the original disjunction, maintaining the same logical structure and meaning. Therefore, the inference is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
