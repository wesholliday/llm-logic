            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled' is a negation of a universal statement. The original statement, 'The zinger must have been fraggled', is a universal statement that asserts that all zingers are fraggled. By negating this statement, we are saying that it is not true that all zingers are fraggled. This leaves open the possibility that some zingers might not be fraggled. Therefore, we can infer that 'The zinger might not have been fraggled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
