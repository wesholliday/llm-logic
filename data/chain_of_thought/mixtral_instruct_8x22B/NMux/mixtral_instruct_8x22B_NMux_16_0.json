In modal logic, the negation of necessity (must) is possibility (might). Therefore, if it's not the case that something must be true, then it might not be true. In this context, if it's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled, then it's possible that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
