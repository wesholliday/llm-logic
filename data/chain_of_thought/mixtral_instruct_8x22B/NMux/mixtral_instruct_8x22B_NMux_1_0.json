            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed' is a negation of a necessity statement. In modal logic, the negation of necessity (must) is possibility (might). Therefore, if it's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed, then it's possible that the flugel was not blimmed. This can be interpreted as 'The flugel might not have been blimmed'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
