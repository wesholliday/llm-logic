            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered' is a negation of a necessity statement. In modal logic, the negation of necessity (must) is possibility (might). Therefore, if it's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered, then it's possible that the fleeg was not bluttered. This is equivalent to saying 'The fleeg might not have been bluttered'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
