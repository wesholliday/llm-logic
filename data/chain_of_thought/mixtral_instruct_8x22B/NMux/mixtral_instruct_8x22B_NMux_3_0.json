            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed' is a negation of a universal statement. The original statement 'The splat must have been morphed' implies that there is no possibility that the splat was not morphed. By negating this statement, we are saying that it is not necessarily true that the splat was morphed. This leaves open the possibility that the splat might not have been morphed. Therefore, from the given statement, we can infer that 'The splat might not have been morphed'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
