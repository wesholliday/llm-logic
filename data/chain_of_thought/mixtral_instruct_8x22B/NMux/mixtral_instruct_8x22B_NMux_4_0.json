            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled' is a negation of a necessity statement. In modal logic, the negation of necessity (must) is possibility (might). Therefore, if it's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled, then it's possible that the fribble was not snurgled. This can be interpreted as 'The fribble might not have been snurgled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
