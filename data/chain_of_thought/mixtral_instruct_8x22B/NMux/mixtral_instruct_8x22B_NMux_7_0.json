            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked\" is a negation of a necessity statement. In modal logic, the negation of necessity (must) is possibility (might). Therefore, if it's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked, then it's possible that the whiffle was not shanked. This can be interpreted as \"The whiffle might not have been shanked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
