            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The project must have been completed by Friday' implies that the project was required to be finished by Friday. The phrase 'must have been' is used to express a high degree of certainty about a past event, in this case, the completion of the project. The statement does not provide any information about the project being extended. Therefore, we cannot infer that the project 'must have been extended or completed by Friday' based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
