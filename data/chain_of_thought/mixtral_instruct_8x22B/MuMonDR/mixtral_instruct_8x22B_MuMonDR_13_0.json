            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The movie must have been in English' implies that the movie was either entirely or predominantly in the English language. However, this statement does not provide any information about whether the movie was also subtitled or not. Subtitles are not a necessary condition for a movie to be in English, as they are typically used to translate dialogue into a different language for viewers who do not understand the original language. Therefore, from the given statement, we cannot infer that the movie must have been subtitled.\n\nAnswer: No.",
