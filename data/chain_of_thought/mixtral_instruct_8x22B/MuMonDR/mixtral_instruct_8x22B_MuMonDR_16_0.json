            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The room must have been cleaned daily' implies that the cleaning of the room was a regular occurrence, happening every day. The phrase 'upon request' suggests that the cleaning could also happen at other times, specifically when requested. However, the original statement does not provide any information about cleaning upon request. Therefore, we cannot infer that the room was cleaned upon request in addition to being cleaned daily.\n\nAnswer: No.",
