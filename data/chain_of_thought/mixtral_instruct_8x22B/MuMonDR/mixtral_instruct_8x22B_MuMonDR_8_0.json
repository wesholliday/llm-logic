            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays\" is a definitive statement that tells us the restaurant was not open for business on Mondays. The statement \"The restaurant must have been open for limited hours or closed on Mondays\" is a broader statement that includes the possibility of the restaurant being open for limited hours on Mondays, in addition to the possibility of it being closed. Since the original statement only tells us that the restaurant was closed on Mondays, and does not provide any information about the restaurant's hours on Mondays, we cannot definitively infer that the restaurant was open for limited hours on Mondays. However, since being closed on Mondays is one of the possibilities included in the broader statement, we can infer that the broader statement is not necessarily false based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
