            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The event must have been formal' specifies that the event was of a formal nature. The term 'formal' is a category in itself, and it does not inherently include 'semi-formal' as a subcategory. 'Formal' and 'semi-formal' are two distinct categories, with 'semi-formal' being less formal than 'formal'. Therefore, from the statement 'The event must have been formal', we cannot infer that the event could also have been 'semi-formal'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
