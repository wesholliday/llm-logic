            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The meeting must have been scheduled for 2 PM' is a definitive statement that implies the meeting was indeed scheduled for 2 PM. The phrase 'must have been' is used to express a high degree of certainty about a past event. When we add 'or scheduled for 2 PM' to the end of the statement, it does not change the meaning because the meeting being scheduled for 2 PM is already implied in the original statement. However, adding 'cancelled' introduces a new possibility that was not present in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The meeting must have been cancelled or scheduled for 2 PM' from the original statement alone, as there is no information given about the meeting being cancelled.\n\nAnswer: No.",
