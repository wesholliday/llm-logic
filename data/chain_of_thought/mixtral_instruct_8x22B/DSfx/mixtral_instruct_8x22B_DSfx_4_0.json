            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'Either the fribble is crinked or it is snurgled' is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions (crinked or snurgled) must be true, but not necessarily both. When we are given the additional information that 'The fribble is not crinked', we can infer that the other condition in the disjunction must be true, because at least one of the conditions must be true. Therefore, we can infer that 'The fribble is snurgled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
