            "content": " Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical operation known as disjunctive syllogism. The statement \"Either the grommet is plopped or it is sploffed\" is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions (plopped or sploffed) must be true. The statement \"The grommet is not plopped\" is a negation of one of the conditions. According to the rules of logic, if one of the conditions in a disjunction is false, then the other condition must be true. Therefore, if the grommet is not plopped, it must be sploffed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
