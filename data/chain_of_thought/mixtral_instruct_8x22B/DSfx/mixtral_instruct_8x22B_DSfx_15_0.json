            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'Either the dreb is spened or it is vroombed' is a classic example of a logical disjunction, which means that either one or the other condition is true, but not both. When we are given the additional information that 'The dreb is not spened', we can infer that the other condition must be true, because the dreb cannot be both spened and vroombed at the same time, according to the initial statement. Therefore, if the dreb is not spened, it must be vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
