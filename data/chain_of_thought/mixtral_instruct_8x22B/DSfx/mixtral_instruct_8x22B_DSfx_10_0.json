            "content": " Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical operation known as disjunctive syllogism. The statement 'Either the wug is garpled or it is sproinged' is a disjunction, which means that either one or both of the statements 'the wug is garpled' and 'the wug is sproinged' are true. The statement 'The wug is not garpled' is the negation of one of the disjuncts. In a disjunctive syllogism, if one of the disjuncts is denied, then the other disjunct must be true. Therefore, from 'Either the wug is garpled or it is sproinged' and 'The wug is not garpled', we can infer 'The wug is sproinged'.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
