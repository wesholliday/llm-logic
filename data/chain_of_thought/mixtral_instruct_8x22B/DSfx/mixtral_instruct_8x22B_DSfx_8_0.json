            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of a logical operation known as disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid argument form. The statement 'Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked' is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions (daggled or cranked) must be true. The second statement 'The sprocket is not daggled' is a negation of one of the conditions. In a disjunctive syllogism, if one of the conditions is denied, then the other condition must be true. Therefore, if the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
