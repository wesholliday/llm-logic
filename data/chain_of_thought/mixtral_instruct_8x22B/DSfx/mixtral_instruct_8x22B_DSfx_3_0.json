            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of a logical rule known as disjunctive syllogism, which states that if you have two statements connected by 'or' (a disjunction), and you know that one of them is false, then the other must be true. In this case, the two statements are 'Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed' (disjunction) and 'The splat is not quanked' (negation of one of the disjuncts). Since we know that the splat is not quanked, we can infer that the other option must be true, i.e., the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
