            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The shank might not be nugged' implies that there is a possibility that the shank is not nugged. The second statement 'Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged' is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions (plooked or nugged) must be true. Since we know that the shank might not be nugged, it follows that the other condition (the shank is plooked) must be true. This is because if the shank is not nugged, then the only other possibility according to the second statement is that it is plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
