Either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that there is a possibility that the zinger is not smoogled. The second statement gives us two possibilities for the zinger: it is either fraggled or smoogled. However, since we know from the first statement that the zinger might not be smoogled, we can infer that the other possibility must be true. Therefore, the zinger must be fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
