It does not confirm that the twonk is not plinked, but it leaves the possibility open.\n\n2. \"Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked\" - This statement gives us two possibilities: either the twonk is varnished, or if it's not varnished, then it must be plinked.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that if the twonk is not plinked (as per the first statement), then according to the second statement, it must be varnished. This is because the second statement provides two mutually exclusive options (varnished or plinked), and if one is not true, then the other must be.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that 'The twonk is varnished'.",
