            "content": " Explanation: This logical argument is in the form of a conditional statement (if-then statement) and a given fact. The conditional statement is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" The given fact is \"Sam took a plane.\" In logic, this type of argument is known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument. The structure of modus ponens is:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. P.\n3. Therefore, Q.\n\nIn this case, P is \"Sam took a plane,\" and Q is \"Erin took a train.\" Since we know that P is true (Sam took a plane), we can infer that Q is also true (Erin took a train). This is a valid logical inference, as it follows the rules of logic.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
