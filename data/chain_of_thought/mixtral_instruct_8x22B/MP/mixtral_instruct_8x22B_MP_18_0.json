            "content": " Explanation: This logical reasoning is based on a type of argument called Modus Ponens, which is a valid argument form. The argument form is as follows: If P, then Q. P. Therefore, Q. In this case, P is 'The doll was plastic' and Q is 'The truck was metal'. Since the first statement is a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the second statement is the antecedent (P) of the conditional statement, we can infer the consequent (Q), which is 'The truck was metal'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
