The hypothesis is the condition that, if met, guarantees the conclusion. In this case, if the hypothesis 'Joe went to the park' is true, then the conclusion 'Lucy went to the zoo' must also be true. Since we are given that 'Joe went to the park' is true, we can infer that 'Lucy went to the zoo' is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
