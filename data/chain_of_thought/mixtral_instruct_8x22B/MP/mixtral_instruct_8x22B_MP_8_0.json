            "content": " Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument known as modus ponens. Modus ponens is a rule of inference that states if P implies Q, and P is true, then Q must be true. In this case, P is 'The vampire was awake' and Q is 'The mummy was awake'. The statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is the implication. Since we know that the vampire was awake (P is true), we can infer that the mummy was awake (Q is true).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
