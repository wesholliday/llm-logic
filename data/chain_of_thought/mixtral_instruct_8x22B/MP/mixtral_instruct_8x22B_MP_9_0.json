            "content": " Explanation: This logical argument is in the form of a conditional statement (if-then statement) and a given fact. The conditional statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" The given fact is \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\" In a conditional statement, if the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is true, then the consequent (the \"then\" part) must also be true. In this case, the antecedent is \"Lisa bought the red shirt,\" which is given as true. Therefore, the consequent \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
