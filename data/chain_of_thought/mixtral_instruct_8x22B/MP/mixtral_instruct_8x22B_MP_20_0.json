            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument that follows the form of a conditional statement. The first statement, \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,\" is a conditional statement, also known as a hypothetical proposition, in the form of \"If P, then Q.\" In this case, P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\" The second statement, \"The apple was red,\" is an assertion that the condition (P) is true. In logic, if a conditional statement is true and the condition (P) is also true, then the conclusion (Q) must be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
