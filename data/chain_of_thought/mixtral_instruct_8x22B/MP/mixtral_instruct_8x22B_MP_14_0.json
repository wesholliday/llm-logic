            "content": " Explanation: This logical reasoning problem can be solved using the concept of modus ponens, which is a rule of inference in classical logic. The rule states that if P implies Q, and P is true, then Q must also be true. In this case, P is 'The bear was in the cave' and Q is 'The wolf was in the den'. The statement 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den' is the implication. Since we know that 'The bear was in the cave' is true, we can infer that 'The wolf was in the den' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
