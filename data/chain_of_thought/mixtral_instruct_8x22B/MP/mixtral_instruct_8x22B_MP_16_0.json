            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument known as modus ponens. Modus ponens is a rule of inference that states if a conditional statement (if P then Q) is true, and the antecedent (P) is also true, then the consequent (Q) must be true. In this case, the conditional statement is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim', and the antecedent 'The shirt was cotton' is given as true. Therefore, according to the rule of modus ponens, we can infer that the consequent 'The pants were denim' is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
