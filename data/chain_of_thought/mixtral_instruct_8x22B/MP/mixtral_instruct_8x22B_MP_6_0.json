            "content": " Explanation: This logical argument is an example of modus ponens, a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus ponens states that if P implies Q, and P is true, then Q must be true. In this case, P is 'Sue chose pizza' and Q is 'Bob chose pasta'. Since we know that 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta' (P implies Q) and 'Sue chose pizza' (P is true), we can infer that 'Bob chose pasta' (Q is true).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
