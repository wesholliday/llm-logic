            "content": " Explanation: This logical argument is an example of modus ponens, a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus ponens states that if P implies Q, and P is true, then Q must also be true. In this case, P is 'Mary was at the wedding' and Q is 'Sue was at the wedding'. The statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is the implication. Since we know that Mary was at the wedding (P is true), we can infer that Sue was also at the wedding (Q is true).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
