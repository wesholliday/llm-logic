            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement, where the condition is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and the conclusion is \"Mark must have bought the blue shirt\". This means that if the condition is true, then the conclusion must also be true. However, if the conclusion is false, then the condition must also be false.\n\nThe second statement \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\" implies that the conclusion of the conditional statement might be false. If the conclusion is false, then according to the rules of logic, the condition must also be false. Therefore, if Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
