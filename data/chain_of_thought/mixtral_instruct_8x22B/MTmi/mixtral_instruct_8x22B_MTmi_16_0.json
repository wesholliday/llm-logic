            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\" is a conditional statement, where the condition is \"the shirt was cotton\" and the conclusion is \"the pants must have been denim\". The second statement \"The pants might not have been denim\" contradicts the conclusion of the conditional statement. However, this does not necessarily mean that the condition of the statement is false. It is possible that the shirt was not cotton, but it is also possible that the shirt was cotton and the pants were not denim, which would simply mean that the conditional statement is false. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The shirt was not cotton\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
