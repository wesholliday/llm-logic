            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\" is a conditional statement, where \"Sue chose pizza\" is the hypothesis and \"Bob must have chosen pasta\" is the conclusion. If the hypothesis is true, then the conclusion must also be true. However, if the conclusion is false, then the hypothesis cannot be true.\n\nThe second statement \"Bob might not have chosen pasta\" implies that the conclusion of the conditional statement is not necessarily true. Since the conclusion is not guaranteed to be true, the hypothesis \"Sue chose pizza\" cannot be true either. Therefore, we can infer that \"Sue did not choose pizza\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
