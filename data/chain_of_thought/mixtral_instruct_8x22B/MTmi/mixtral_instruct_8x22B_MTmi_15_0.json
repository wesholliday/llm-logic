            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train' is a conditional statement, where 'Sam took a plane' is the hypothesis and 'Erin must have taken a train' is the conclusion. The second statement 'Erin might not have taken a train' is a negation of the conclusion of the conditional statement. In logic, if the conclusion of a conditional statement is false, then the hypothesis must also be false. Therefore, if Erin did not take a train, then Sam could not have taken a plane.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
