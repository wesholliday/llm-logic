            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" is a conditional statement, where \"Mary was at the wedding\" is the hypothesis and \"Sue must have been at the wedding\" is the conclusion. This means that if the hypothesis is true, then the conclusion must also be true. However, if the conclusion is false, then the hypothesis must also be false.\n\nThe second statement \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\" suggests that the conclusion of the conditional statement might be false. If Sue might not have been at the wedding, then it's possible that the condition \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" is not met.\n\nTherefore, if the conclusion of the conditional statement is false (Sue might not have been at the wedding), then the hypothesis (Mary was at the wedding) must also be false.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that 'Mary was not at the wedding'.",
