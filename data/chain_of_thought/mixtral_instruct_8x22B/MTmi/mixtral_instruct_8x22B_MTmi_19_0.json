            "content": " Explanation: We have two statements to consider:\n1. If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n2. Jen might not have watched basketball.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if Tom watched football, then it is a necessary condition for Jen to have watched basketball. This is a logical implication, where the truth of the first statement (Tom watched football) guarantees the truth of the second statement (Jen watched basketball).\n\nThe second statement introduces uncertainty about whether Jen watched basketball or not. Since it says \"Jen might not have watched basketball,\" it implies that there is a possibility that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nNow, if we combine these two statements, we can analyze the situation. If Tom watched football, then according to the first statement, Jen must have watched basketball. However, the second statement tells us that Jen might not have watched basketball. This creates a contradiction, as both statements cannot be true at the same time.\n\nTo resolve this contradiction, we must accept that one of the statements is false. Since the second statement is a possibility (Jen might not have watched basketball), it does not necessarily mean that Jen did not watch basketball. It only introduces the possibility of her not watching basketball.\n\nHowever, if we assume that Jen did not watch basketball (based on the second statement), then according to the first statement, Tom could not have watched football. This is because the first statement establishes a necessary condition for Tom watching football, which is Jen watching basketball. If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom could not have watched football.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the logical analysis, we can infer that if Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football. However, this inference is based on the assumption that Jen did not watch basketball, which is not explicitly stated as a fact.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot definitively infer that \"Tom did not watch football\" based solely on the given statements. The inference is possible if we assume that Jen did not watch basketball, but this assumption is not explicitly stated as a fact.",
