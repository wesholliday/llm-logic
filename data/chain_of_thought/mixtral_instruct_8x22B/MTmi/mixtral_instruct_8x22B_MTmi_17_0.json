            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad\" and \"Kate might not have eaten salad\". The first statement is a conditional statement, where the condition is \"Ben ate pasta\" and the consequence is \"Kate must have eaten salad\". The second statement is a possibility, suggesting that the consequence of the conditional statement might not be true.\n\nIn logic, if a conditional statement is true and its consequence is false, then the condition must also be false. This is known as the principle of contrapositive. In this case, if \"Kate might not have eaten salad\" is true, then the consequence of the conditional statement is not always true. Therefore, the condition \"Ben ate pasta\" must not always be true either.\n\nHowever, the statement \"Kate might not have eaten salad\" does not definitively state that Kate did not eat salad. It only suggests a possibility. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that \"Ben did not eat pasta\". We can only infer that it is possible that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot definitively infer that 'Ben did not eat pasta'.",
