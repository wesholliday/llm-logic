            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\" is a conditional statement, where \"the book was written by James\" is the hypothesis and \"the book must be a mystery novel\" is the conclusion. The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\"\n\nThe second statement \"The book might not be a mystery novel\" introduces the possibility that the book is not a mystery novel. However, this does not confirm that the book is not a mystery novel, it only states that it might not be.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The book was not written by James\" based on the given information. We would need a definite statement that the book is not a mystery novel to use the contrapositive and make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No.",
