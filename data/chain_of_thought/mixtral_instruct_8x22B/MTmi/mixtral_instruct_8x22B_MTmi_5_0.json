The statement 'Amy might not have played tennis' implies that the conclusion of the conditional statement is not necessarily true. In logic, when the conclusion of a conditional statement is false, the hypothesis can be either true or false. Therefore, from the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that 'Jeff did not play basketball'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
