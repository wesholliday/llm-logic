            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is a conditional statement, also known as a material implication. In this case, the vampire being awake is the hypothesis (or antecedent), and the mummy being awake is the conclusion (or consequent). The statement being true means that if the hypothesis is true, then the conclusion must also be true. However, this does not necessarily mean that the hypothesis is true if the conclusion is true. In other words, just because the mummy was awake, we cannot definitively say that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: No.",
