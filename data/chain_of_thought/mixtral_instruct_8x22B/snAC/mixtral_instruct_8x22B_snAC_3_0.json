            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. This statement tells us that if the condition (the book was written by James) is true, then the conclusion (the book is a mystery novel) is also true. However, this statement does not tell us anything about what happens when the conclusion is true. In other words, just because the book is a mystery novel, we cannot necessarily conclude that it was written by James. There could be other authors who also write mystery novels.\n\nAnswer: No.",
