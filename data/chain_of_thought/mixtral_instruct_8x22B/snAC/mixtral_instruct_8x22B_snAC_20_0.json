            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement, also known as a material implication. In this case, the statement is in the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\" The truth of a conditional statement does not imply the truth of its converse, which would be \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\" Therefore, even though we know that the banana was yellow (Q is true), we cannot conclude that the apple was red (P is true) based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
