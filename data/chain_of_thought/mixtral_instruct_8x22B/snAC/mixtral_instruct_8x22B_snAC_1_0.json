            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement, also known as a material implication. In this case, \"Mary was at the wedding\" is the hypothesis, and \"Sue was at the wedding\" is the conclusion. The statement is true if both the hypothesis and conclusion are true, or if the hypothesis is false and the conclusion is true. However, the truth of the conclusion does not imply the truth of the hypothesis. In this case, we know that \"Sue was at the wedding\" is true, but this does not necessarily mean that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true. It's possible that Sue was at the wedding, but Mary was not.\n\nAnswer: No.",
