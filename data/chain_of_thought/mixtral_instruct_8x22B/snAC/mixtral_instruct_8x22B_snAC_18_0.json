            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. In this case, \"the doll was plastic\" is the hypothesis, and \"the truck was metal\" is the conclusion. The statement is true if, whenever the hypothesis is true, the conclusion is also true. However, this does not mean that the hypothesis is true whenever the conclusion is true. In other words, just because the truck is metal, we cannot conclude that the doll is plastic. The doll could be made of any material, and the truck would still be metal.\n\nAnswer: No.",
