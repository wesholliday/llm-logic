If it's possible that Jeff did not play basketball (as stated in the premise), then it cannot be the case that Jeff must have played basketball (as stated in the conclusion). The argument is an example of the logical principle of negation, where the negation of \"must\" (necessity) is \"might not\" (possibility).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
