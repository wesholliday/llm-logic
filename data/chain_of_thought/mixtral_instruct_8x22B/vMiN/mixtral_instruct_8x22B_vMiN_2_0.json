            "content": " Explanation: The argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows from the premise. The premise states that there is a possibility that the griffin was not in the forest. This means that it is not necessarily the case that the griffin must have been in the forest. Therefore, the conclusion that it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest is a logical consequence of the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
