            "content": " Explanation: The argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. The premise states that it's possible that Mary was not at the wedding, which means that it's not necessarily true that Mary was at the wedding. The conclusion, which states that it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding, is a direct consequence of the premise. If it's possible that Mary was not at the wedding, then it cannot be the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
