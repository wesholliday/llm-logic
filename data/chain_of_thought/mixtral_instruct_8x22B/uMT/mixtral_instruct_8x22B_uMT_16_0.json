            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements:\n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n2. The pants were not denim.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must be denim. However, the second statement tells us that the pants were not denim. This creates a contradiction, as the pants cannot be both denim and not denim at the same time.\n\nSince the second statement is definitive (the pants were not denim), we can conclude that the condition for the first statement (the shirt being cotton) must not be true. Therefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
