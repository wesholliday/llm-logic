The unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest. However, the second statement tells us that the unicorn was not in the forest. Therefore, it is not possible for the griffin to be in the forest, because if it were, the unicorn would also have to be in the forest, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.",
