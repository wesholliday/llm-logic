            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements: 1) If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo; and 2) Lucy did not go to the zoo. The first statement is a conditional statement, where \"Joe went to the park\" is the hypothesis and \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is the conclusion. The second statement tells us that the conclusion of the conditional statement is false. In a conditional statement, if the conclusion is false, then the hypothesis must also be false. Therefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
