            "content": " Explanation: We are given two pieces of information: (1) If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train; and (2) Erin did not take a train. From the second statement, we know that Erin did not take a train. Since the first statement is a conditional statement (if-then), we can look at its contrapositive to help us understand the relationship between the two statements. The contrapositive of \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\" Since we know that Erin did not take a train, we can apply the contrapositive to infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
