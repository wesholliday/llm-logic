            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements:\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This is a conditional statement, where the vampire being awake is the hypothesis and the mummy being awake is the conclusion.\n2. The mummy was not awake. This is a direct statement about the mummy's state.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the conclusion of the conditional statement is false (the mummy was not awake). In a conditional statement, if the conclusion is false, then the hypothesis must also be false to keep the statement true. Therefore, if the mummy was not awake, then the vampire could not have been awake either.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
