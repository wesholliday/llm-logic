The truck was not metal.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must be metal. However, the second statement tells us that the truck is not metal. This creates a contradiction, as both statements cannot be true at the same time.\n\nSince the second statement is a fact (the truck is not metal), the first statement cannot be true. Therefore, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
