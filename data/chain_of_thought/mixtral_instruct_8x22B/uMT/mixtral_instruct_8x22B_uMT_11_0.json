The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be written as \"If P then Q,\" where P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry.\" The second statement is \"the muffins were not blueberry,\" which can be written as \"not Q.\"\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, if a statement \"If P then Q\" is true and \"not Q\" is also true, then \"not P\" must be true. In other words, if the cake was chocolate (P), then the muffins were blueberry (Q), but the muffins were not blueberry (not Q), then the cake was not chocolate (not P).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
