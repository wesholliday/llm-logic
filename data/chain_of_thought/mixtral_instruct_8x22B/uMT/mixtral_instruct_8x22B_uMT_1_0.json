            "content": " Explanation: We are given two premises:\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. (This is a conditional statement, where Mary being at the wedding is the sufficient condition for Sue being at the wedding.)\n2. Sue was not at the wedding. (This is a direct statement about Sue's whereabouts.)\n\nFrom the second premise, we know that Sue was not at the wedding. According to the first premise, if Mary had been at the wedding, then Sue would have been at the wedding as well. However, since we know that Sue was not at the wedding, it must be the case that Mary was not at the wedding either. This is because the first premise establishes a relationship between Mary and Sue's presence at the wedding, and if one part of the relationship does not hold (Sue not being at the wedding), then the other part (Mary being at the wedding) cannot hold either.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
