            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements: 1) If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad, and 2) Kate did not eat salad. These statements form a logical chain where the first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement, and the second statement contradicts the consequent (then) part of the conditional statement. Since the consequent did not happen (Kate did not eat salad), we can infer that the antecedent (if) part of the conditional statement also did not happen (Ben did not eat pasta). This is based on the logical principle of modus tollens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and its consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
