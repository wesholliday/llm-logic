            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements: 1) If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis; and 2) Amy did not play tennis. These statements form a logical chain where the first statement is a conditional (if-then) statement, and the second statement contradicts the consequent (then) part of the conditional statement. Since the consequent is false (Amy did not play tennis), according to the rules of logic, the antecedent (if) part of the conditional statement must also be false. Therefore, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
