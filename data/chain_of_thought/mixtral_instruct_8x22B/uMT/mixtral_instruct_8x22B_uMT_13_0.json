            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements:\n1. If the car was red, then the truck was blue. (This is a conditional statement, where the car being red is the hypothesis and the truck being blue is the conclusion.)\n2. The truck was not blue. (This is a direct statement that contradicts the conclusion of the conditional statement.)\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the hypothesis of the conditional statement must be false because the conclusion is false. In other words, if the truck is not blue, then the car cannot be red, as per the given conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
