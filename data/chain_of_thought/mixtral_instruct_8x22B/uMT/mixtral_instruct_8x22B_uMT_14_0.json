            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements:\n1. If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n2. The wolf was not in the den.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if the bear was in the cave, then it would imply that the wolf was in the den. However, the second statement tells us that the wolf was not in the den. This creates a contradiction with the first statement if we assume that the bear was in the cave. Therefore, to resolve this contradiction, we must conclude that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
