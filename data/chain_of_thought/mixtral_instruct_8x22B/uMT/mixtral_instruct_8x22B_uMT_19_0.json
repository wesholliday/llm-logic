            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements:\n1. If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n2. Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can see that Tom watching football is a sufficient condition for Jen to watch basketball. This means that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. However, the second statement tells us that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nSince the first statement implies that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball, but we know from the second statement that Jen did not watch basketball, we can infer that the condition for Jen watching basketball (Tom watching football) did not occur. Therefore, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
