From premise (2), we know that the consequent of the conditional statement in premise (1) is false. According to the principle of contrapositive, if a conditional statement is true and its consequent is false, then its antecedent must also be false. Therefore, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
