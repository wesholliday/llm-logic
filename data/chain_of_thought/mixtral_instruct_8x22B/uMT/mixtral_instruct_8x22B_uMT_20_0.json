            "content": " Explanation: We are given two statements:\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n2. The banana was not yellow.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if the apple was red, then the banana must be yellow. However, the second statement tells us that the banana was not yellow. This creates a contradiction, as the banana cannot be both yellow and not yellow at the same time.\n\nSince the second statement is true (the banana was not yellow), the first statement cannot be true. Therefore, the condition for the apple being red (which would imply the banana being yellow) is not met.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that the apple was not red.",
