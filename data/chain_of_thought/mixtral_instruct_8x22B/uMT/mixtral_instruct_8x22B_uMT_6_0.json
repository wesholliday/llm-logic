            "content": " Explanation: We are given two pieces of information: (1) If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta; and (2) Bob did not choose pasta. From the first statement, we can infer that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob would not have chosen pasta either. However, the second statement tells us that regardless of what Sue chose, Bob did not choose pasta. This creates a contradiction with the first statement, which implies that the initial condition (Sue choosing pizza) could not have occurred. Therefore, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
