The second statement tells us that the book is not a mystery novel. These two statements cannot both be true at the same time. Therefore, we can infer that at least one of the statements is false. If the book is not a mystery novel, then it cannot have been written by James, according to the first statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that the book was not written by James.",
