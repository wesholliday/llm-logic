            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement, also known as a material implication. In this case, \"If the apple was red\" is the hypothesis (or antecedent), and \"then the banana was yellow\" is the conclusion (or consequent). The statement is true if both the hypothesis and conclusion are true, or if the hypothesis is false. However, the truth of the consequent does not imply the truth of the hypothesis. In this case, we know that the banana was yellow, but this does not necessarily mean that the apple was red. It is possible that the apple was a different color and the banana was still yellow.\n\nAnswer: No.",
