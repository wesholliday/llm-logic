            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement, also known as a material implication. In this case, \"Mary was at the wedding\" is the hypothesis, and \"Sue was at the wedding\" is the conclusion. The statement is true if both the hypothesis and conclusion are true, or if the hypothesis is false and the conclusion is true. However, the statement does not tell us anything about the truth of the hypothesis when the conclusion is true. In other words, just because Sue was at the wedding, we cannot conclude that Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No.",
