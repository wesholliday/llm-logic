However, just because the conclusion is true, it does not necessarily mean that the hypothesis is true. In other words, Jen could have watched basketball regardless of whether Tom watched football or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"Tom watched football\" is true based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: No.",
