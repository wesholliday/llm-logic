However, it also mentions that the book might not be on the table. This does not necessarily mean that the book is on the shelf, as there could be other locations where the book might be. The statement only provides information about two possible locations, but it does not exclude the possibility of other locations. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the book is on the shelf based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
