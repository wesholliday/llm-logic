The second statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" implies that the possibility of Fido being in the garden is not certain. However, this does not automatically mean that Fido is inside. It only suggests that the possibility of Fido being inside is not ruled out by the given information. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that Fido is inside based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
