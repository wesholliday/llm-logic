            "content": " Explanation: The statement presents two possibilities for the location of the remote control: either it is on the coffee table or it might be hiding under the couch. However, it also mentions that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch. This means that the possibility of the remote control being under the couch is uncertain or even unlikely. Since the remote control must be in one of the two mentioned locations and the possibility of it being under the couch is uncertain, we can infer that the remote control is more likely to be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
