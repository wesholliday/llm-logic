However, this does not necessarily mean that the keys are in the drawer. The statement only provides the possibility of the keys being in the drawer, but it does not confirm it. The keys could also be in a third location that was not mentioned in the statement. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: No.",
