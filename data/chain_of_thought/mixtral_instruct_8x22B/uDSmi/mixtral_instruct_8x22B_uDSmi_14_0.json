It also mentions that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge. This does not necessarily mean that the milk is on the counter, as the statement only provides two possibilities and does not exclude the possibility of the milk being in another location. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the milk is on the counter based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
