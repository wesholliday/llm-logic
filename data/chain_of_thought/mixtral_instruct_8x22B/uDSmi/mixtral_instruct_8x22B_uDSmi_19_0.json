It also mentions that the watch might not be on his wrist. However, the statement does not confirm that the watch is definitely not on his wrist, only that it might not be. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the watch is charging on the dresser based on the given information. It is possible that the watch is on his wrist, despite the suggestion that it might not be.\n\nAnswer: No.",
