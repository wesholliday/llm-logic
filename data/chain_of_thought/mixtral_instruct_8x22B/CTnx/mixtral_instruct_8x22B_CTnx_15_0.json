            "content": " Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then not Q\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If Q, then not P\", which is logically equivalent to the original statement. In this case, \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was not spened\" is the original statement, and its contrapositive is \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\". Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer that if the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
