            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat did not quank' is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed'. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer that 'If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed' is true if the original statement is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
