            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle did not tink' is a conditional statement that can be written as 'shanked => not tink'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'tink => not shanked', which is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. The statement 'If the whiffle tink, then the whiffle was not shanked' is the contrapositive of the original statement, so we can infer that it is true if the original statement is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
