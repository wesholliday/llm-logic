            "content": " Explanation: The original statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it did not surn\" is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not Q, then not P\", which in this case translates to \"If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered\". In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer that \"If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
