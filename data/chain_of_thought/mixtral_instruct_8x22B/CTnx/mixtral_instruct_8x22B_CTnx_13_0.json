            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the glip was slogged, then the glip was not tragged' is a logical statement of the form 'If P, then not Q'. This means that if P is true, then Q must be false. In this case, P is 'the glip was slogged' and Q is 'the glip was tragged'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If the glip was tragged, then the glip was not slogged', which is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
