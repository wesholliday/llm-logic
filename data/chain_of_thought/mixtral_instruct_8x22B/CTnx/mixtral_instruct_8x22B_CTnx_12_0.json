            "content": " Explanation: The given statement \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint\" is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was not shripped\", which is in the form of \"If Q, then P\". In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer that \"If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was not shripped\" is true if the original statement is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
