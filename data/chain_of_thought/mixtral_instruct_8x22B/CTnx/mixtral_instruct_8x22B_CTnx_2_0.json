            "content": " Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the wug was flooped\" and Q is \"the wug did not bim the zoint\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was not flooped\". In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer that if the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
