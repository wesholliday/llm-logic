            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of a logical implication and its contrapositive. The original statement is \"If P then Q\", where P is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and Q is \"the fribble did not crink\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not Q then not P\", which translates to \"If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\". In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
