The contrapositive of this statement is 'Varnished implies not plinked', which is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. The contrapositive is exactly the statement 'If the twonk was varnished, then the twonk was not plinked'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
