            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled\" is a conditional statement that can be written as \"Fraggled => Not Smoogled\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"Smoogled => Not Fraggled\", which is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. This means that if the zinger was smoogled, then it cannot be fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
