            "content": " Explanation: The given statement \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob did not movated\" is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the flob movated, then the flob was not skizzled\". In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer that \"If the flob movated, then the flob was not skizzled\" is true if the original statement is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
