            "content": " Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the smonk was vreebled\" and Q is \"the smonk did not plagged\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\". In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if it is true that \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk did not plagged\", then it is also true that \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
