            "content": " Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the sneg was crampled\" and Q is \"the sneg did not sprot the frink.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\" In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer that if the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
