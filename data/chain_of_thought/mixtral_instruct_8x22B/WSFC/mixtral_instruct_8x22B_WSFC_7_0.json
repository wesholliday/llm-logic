The statement \"The team might win the match and they might lose the match\" is a conjunction, which means that both outcomes are possible at the same time. However, in the context of a single match, the team cannot both win and lose at the same time. Therefore, while the original statement implies that both outcomes are possible, it does not imply that both outcomes can occur simultaneously.\n\nAnswer: No.",
