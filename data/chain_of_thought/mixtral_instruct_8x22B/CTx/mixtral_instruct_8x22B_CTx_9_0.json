            "content": " Explanation: The original statement \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\" is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not Q, then not P\", which in this case translates to \"If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked\". In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer that \"If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
