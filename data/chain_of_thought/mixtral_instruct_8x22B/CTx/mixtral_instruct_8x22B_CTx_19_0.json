            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged' is a conditional statement, also known as a sufficient condition. It means that if the smonk was vreebled, then it is guaranteed that the smonk plagged. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled'. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if the original statement is true, we can infer that if the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
