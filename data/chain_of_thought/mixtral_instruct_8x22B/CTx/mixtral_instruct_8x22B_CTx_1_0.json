            "content": " Explanation: The original statement \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled\" is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed\". In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, from the original statement, we can infer that if the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
