            "content": " Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P then Q,\" where P is \"the flug was blummed\" and Q is \"the flug was zimmed.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P.\" Therefore, the contrapositive of the original statement is \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\" Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer that \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed\" is true if the original statement is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
