            "content": " Explanation: This question is about the logical relationship between two statements. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P then Q,\" where P is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and Q is \"the dreb was spened.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\" In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if it is true that \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened,\" then it must also be true that \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
