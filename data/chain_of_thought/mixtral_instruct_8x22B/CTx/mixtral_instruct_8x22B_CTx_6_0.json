            "content": " Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P then Q,\" where P is \"the grommet was sploffed\" and Q is \"the grommet plopped the frink.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not Q then not P,\" which translates to \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\" In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if the original statement is true, we can infer that the grommet was not sploffed if it did not plop the frink.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
