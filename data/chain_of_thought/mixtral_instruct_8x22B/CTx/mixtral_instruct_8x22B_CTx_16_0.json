            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink' is a conditional statement, where 'the sneg was crampled' is the hypothesis and 'the sneg sproted the frink' is the conclusion. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If the sneg did not sprot the frink, then the sneg was not crampled'. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if it is true that 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink', then it is also true that 'If the sneg did not sprot the frink, then the sneg was not crampled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
