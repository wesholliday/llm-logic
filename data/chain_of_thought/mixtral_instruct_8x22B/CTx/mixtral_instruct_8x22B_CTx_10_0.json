            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled' is a conditional statement, also known as a sufficient condition. This means that if the condition (the wug was sproinged) is true, then the consequence (it was garpled) must also be true. However, the statement does not say anything about what happens when the wug is not sproinged or not garpled.\n\nTo infer 'If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged', we would need to know that the condition is also necessary, not just sufficient. In other words, we would need to know that the only way the wug can be garpled is if it was sproinged. Without this information, we cannot make the inference.\n\nHowever, the inference we are trying to make is a form of logical reasoning known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, if 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled' is true, then 'If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
