            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated' is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If the flob did not movate, then the flob was not skizzled'. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if it is true that 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated', then it is also true that 'If the flob did not movate, then the flob was not skizzled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
