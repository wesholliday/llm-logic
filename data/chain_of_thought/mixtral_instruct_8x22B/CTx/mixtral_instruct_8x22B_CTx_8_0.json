            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\". In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if it is true that \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\", then it is also true that \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
