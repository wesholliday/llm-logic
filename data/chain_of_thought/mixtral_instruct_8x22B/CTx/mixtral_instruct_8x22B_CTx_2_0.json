            "content": " Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P then Q,\" where P is \"the wug was flooped\" and Q is \"the wug bimmed the zoint.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P.\" Therefore, the contrapositive of the original statement is \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\" Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer that if the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
