            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked' is a conditional statement, where 'the fribble was snurgled' is the hypothesis and 'the fribble crinked' is the conclusion. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled'. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if it is true that 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked', then it is also true that 'If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
