            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged' is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If the clug did not snug, then the clug was not fleeked'. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if it is true that 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged', then it is also true that 'If the clug did not snug, then the clug was not fleeked'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
