            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\" is a conditional statement, also known as a material implication. The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled\". In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if it is true that \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\", then it is also true that \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
