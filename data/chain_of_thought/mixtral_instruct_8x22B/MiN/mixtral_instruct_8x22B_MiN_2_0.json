            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The griffin might not have been in the forest' implies that there is a possibility that the griffin was not in the forest. This means that the griffin's presence in the forest is not a certainty or a necessity. Therefore, it is not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest. The original statement is a negation of the certainty of the griffin's presence, which aligns with the inference 'It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
