            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The alien might not have visited Mars' implies that there is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars. This means that the alien's visit to Mars is not a certainty, but rather a possibility. The statement 'It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars' also implies that the alien's visit to Mars is not a certainty, but rather a possibility.
