            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The milk might not be on the counter' is a possibility statement, indicating that there is a chance that the milk is not on the counter. This does not exclude the possibility that the milk might also be on the counter. However, it does contradict the statement 'The milk must be on the counter', which is a necessity statement, indicating that there is no possibility for the milk to be anywhere else but the counter. Therefore, if 'The milk might not be on the counter', then it cannot be true that 'The milk must be on the counter'. This leads us to the conclusion that 'It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
