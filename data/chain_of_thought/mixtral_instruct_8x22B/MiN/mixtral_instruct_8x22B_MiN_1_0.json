            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'Mary might not have been at the wedding' is a possibility statement, indicating that there is a chance Mary was not at the wedding. This does not definitively state that Mary was not at the wedding, but rather that her presence was not guaranteed. The statement 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding' is a negation of a necessity statement. It implies that it is not necessarily true that Mary was at the wedding. Both statements convey the idea that Mary's presence at the wedding was not a certainty. Therefore, the first statement can be inferred from the second.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
