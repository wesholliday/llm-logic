            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'Sue might not have chosen pizza' is a possibility statement, indicating that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza. This means that the outcome of Sue choosing pizza is not certain or necessary. The statement 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza' is a negation of a necessity statement, indicating that it is not necessary that Sue chose pizza. Since both statements convey the idea that Sue choosing pizza is not a certain or necessary outcome, they are equivalent in meaning.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
