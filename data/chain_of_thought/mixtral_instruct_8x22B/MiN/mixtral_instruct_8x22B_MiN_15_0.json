This means that there is a chance that the shoes are not in the closet, but it does not definitively state that they are not there. On the other hand, 'It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet' is stating that it is not a necessity or a requirement for the shoes to be in the closet. This means that the shoes do not have to be in the closet, which is a similar concept to the possibility that they might not be there. Therefore, from the statement 'The shoes might not be in the closet', we can infer 'It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
