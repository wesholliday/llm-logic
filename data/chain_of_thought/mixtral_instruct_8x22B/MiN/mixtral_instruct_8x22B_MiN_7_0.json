            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"Alex might not have finished the race\" implies that there is a possibility that Alex did not finish the race. This means that the outcome of the race, with respect to Alex, is uncertain or not guaranteed. The statement \"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race\" also implies uncertainty or lack of guarantee about Alex finishing the race.
