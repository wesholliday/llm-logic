            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed\" is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. The statement \"The splat might not be quanked\" introduces the possibility that the splat is not quanked. Since the splat must either be quanked or morphed, and we know that it might not be quanked, we can infer that the splat is morphed. This is because if the splat is not quanked, then the only remaining possibility is that it is morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
