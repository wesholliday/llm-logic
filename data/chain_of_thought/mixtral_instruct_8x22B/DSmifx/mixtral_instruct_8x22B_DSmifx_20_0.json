The second statement 'The fleeg might not be surned' suggests that there is a possibility that the fleeg is not surned. However, this does not necessarily mean that the fleeg is bluttered. It is possible that the fleeg is neither surned nor bluttered, or that it is both surned and bluttered. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that 'The fleeg is bluttered' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
