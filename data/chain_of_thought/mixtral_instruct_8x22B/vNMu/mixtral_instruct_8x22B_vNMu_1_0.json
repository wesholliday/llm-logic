            "content": " Explanation: The argument is logically valid. The premise states that it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding, which means that Mary's presence at the wedding was not necessary or obligatory. This implies that there was a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding. Therefore, the conclusion that Mary might not have been at the wedding follows logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
