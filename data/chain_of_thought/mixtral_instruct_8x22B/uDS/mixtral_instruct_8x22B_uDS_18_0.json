It then provides additional information that the notebook is not on the nightstand. Since these are the only two possible locations mentioned, and we know the notebook is not in one of those locations, we can infer that it must be in the other location. Therefore, based on the information given, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
