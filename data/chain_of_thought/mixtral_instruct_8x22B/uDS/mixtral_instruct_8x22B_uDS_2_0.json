            "content": " Explanation: The statement is a classic example of logical disjunction, where two propositions are connected by 'or'. In this case, the propositions are \"the book is on the shelf\" and \"the book is resting on the table\". The statement also includes the negation of one of the propositions, \"the book isn't resting on the table\". According to the rules of logic, if one of the propositions in a disjunction is false, then the other must be true for the entire statement to be true. Therefore, since we know that the book isn't resting on the table, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
