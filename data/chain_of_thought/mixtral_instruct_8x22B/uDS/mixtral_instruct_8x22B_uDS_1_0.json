In this case, the disjunction is \"Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden.\" The statement also includes the proposition that \"Fido is not in the garden.\" Since Fido cannot be in the garden, the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside. Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
