In this case, the two conditions are \"the phone is in the living room\" and \"the phone is ringing in the kitchen.\" The statement also includes the additional information that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen. Since one of the conditions must be true and we know that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen, we can infer that the other condition, \"the phone is in the living room,\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
