            "content": " Explanation: The statement presents two possibilities for the location of the toy: either it is in the toy box or it is on the shelf. It then provides additional information that the toy is not on the shelf. Since these are the only two possibilities given and one has been eliminated, we can infer that the toy must be in the toy box. This is a form of logical reasoning known as disjunctive syllogism, where if we have two alternatives and one is false, then the other must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
