            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The company might expand or downsize' is a disjunction, which means that either one of the two possibilities (expanding or downsizing) could occur, but not necessarily both. When we say 'The company might expand and the company might downsize', we are implying that both possibilities could happen, which is not necessarily true based on the original statement.
