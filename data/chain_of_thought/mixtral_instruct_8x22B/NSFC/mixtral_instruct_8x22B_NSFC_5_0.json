            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'Sarah might study biology or chemistry' implies that Sarah has the possibility of studying either biology or chemistry, but not necessarily both. The use of 'or' in this context is inclusive, meaning it could be one or the other, or both. However, the statement does not provide enough information to definitively say that Sarah might study both subjects. It only tells us that she might study at least one of them.\n\nAnswer: No.",
