            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The team might win or lose the match' is a disjunction, which means that either one of the outcomes (winning or losing) is possible. When we infer 'The team might win the match and the team might lose the match', we are expressing the same idea but in a different way. This is known as a conjunction, where both outcomes are considered possible but not necessarily at the same time. In logic, the disjunction and the conjunction in this case are equivalent because they both convey the possibility of two mutually exclusive outcomes.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
