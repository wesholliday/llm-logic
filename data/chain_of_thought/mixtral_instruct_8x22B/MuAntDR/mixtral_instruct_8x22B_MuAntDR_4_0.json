However, we cannot definitively infer that the meeting was cancelled based solely on this statement. The statement only tells us that the meeting was either at 2 PM or it was cancelled, but it does not provide enough information to conclude that it was definitely cancelled. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive inference about the meeting being cancelled based on this statement alone.\n\nAnswer: No.",
