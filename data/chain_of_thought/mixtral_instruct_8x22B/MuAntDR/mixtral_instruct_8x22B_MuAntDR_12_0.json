However, the statement does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the project was extended. It is also possible that the project was completed by Friday, as that is one of the two possible outcomes mentioned in the statement. Without additional context or information, we cannot definitively determine whether the project was extended or not.\n\nAnswer: No.",
