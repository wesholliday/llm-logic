            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"The envelope must have been under a bed or upstairs\" suggests that there are two possible locations for the envelope: either under a bed or upstairs. However, this statement does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the envelope is upstairs. It could just as well be under a bed.
