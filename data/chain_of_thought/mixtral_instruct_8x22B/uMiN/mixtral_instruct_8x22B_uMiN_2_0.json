            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"The griffin might not have been in the forest\" implies that there is a possibility that the griffin was not in the forest. This means that the griffin's presence in the forest is not a certainty, but rather a possibility. If it's possible that the griffin was not in the forest, then it cannot be true that the griffin must have been in the forest. The phrase \"must have been\" implies a certainty or necessity, which contradicts the possibility that the griffin might not have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
