This does not definitively state that the scarf is not in the backpack, but rather suggests that it is not a certainty. Therefore, we cannot infer that it is not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in the backpack, as the statement does not provide enough information to make such a definitive conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No.",
