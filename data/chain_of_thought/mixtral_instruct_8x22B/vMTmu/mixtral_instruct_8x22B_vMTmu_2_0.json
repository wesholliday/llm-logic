            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical structure known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states \"If P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\" In this case, \"P\" is \"The griffin was in the forest\" and \"Q\" is \"The unicorn must have been in the forest.\" The first premise is the conditional statement \"If P, then Q,\" the second premise is \"Not Q,\" and the conclusion is \"Therefore, not P.\" Since this argument follows the form of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
