            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical construct known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must be false. In this case, P is 'The vampire was awake' and Q is 'The mummy must have been awake'. The first premise states that if P is true, then Q must be true. The second premise states that Q is not true. Therefore, according to the rule of modus tollens, P must not be true.\n\nHowever, the argument also involves the use of modal logic, specifically the use of the word 'must'. This adds a layer of complexity to the argument. In modal logic, 'must' implies necessity, not just a simple truth statement. So, the first premise could be interpreted as 'If the vampire was awake, then it is necessary that the mummy was awake'. The second premise then denies this necessity, not just the truth of the statement.\n\nDespite this added complexity, the argument remains logically valid. If it is necessary for the mummy to be awake for the vampire to be awake, and it is not necessary for the mummy to be awake, then the vampire cannot be awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
