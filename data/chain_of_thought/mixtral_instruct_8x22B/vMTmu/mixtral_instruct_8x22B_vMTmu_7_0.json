            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical construct known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens has the following structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"Alex finished the race\" and Q is \"Chris must have finished the race\". The first premise is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race\", which matches the form of the first statement in modus tollens. The second premise is \"It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race\", which matches the form of the second statement in modus tollens. The conclusion is \"Alex did not finish the race\", which matches the form of the conclusion in modus tollens.\n\nSince the argument matches the form of modus tollens, and modus tollens is a valid form of argument, this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
