            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical structure known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. The general form of modus tollens is:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue must have been at the wedding\". The first premise is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\", which matches the form of the first premise in modus tollens. The second premise is \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding\", which is the negation of Q and matches the form of the second premise in modus tollens. The conclusion is \"Mary was not at the wedding\", which is the negation of P and matches the form of the conclusion in modus tollens.\n\nSince the argument matches the form of modus tollens, and modus tollens is a valid form of argument, this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
