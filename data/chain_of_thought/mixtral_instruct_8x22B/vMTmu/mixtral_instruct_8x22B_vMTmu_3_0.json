            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical structure known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens has the following structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P is 'The book was written by James' and Q is 'The book must be a mystery novel'. The first premise is 'If P, then Q', the second premise is 'Not Q', and the conclusion is 'Therefore, not P'. Since this argument follows the structure of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
