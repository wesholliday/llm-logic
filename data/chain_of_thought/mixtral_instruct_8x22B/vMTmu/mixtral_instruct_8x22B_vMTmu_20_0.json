            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical construct known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must be false. In this case, P is 'The apple was red' and Q is 'The banana must have been yellow'. The first premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. The second premise states that it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow, which means Q is false. Therefore, according to the rule of modus tollens, P must be false, which means 'The apple was not red'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
