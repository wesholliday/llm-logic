            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical construct known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must be false. In this case, P is 'The doll was plastic' and Q is 'The truck must have been metal'. The first premise is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal', which is equivalent to P implies Q. The second premise is 'It's not the case that the truck must have been metal', which is equivalent to Q is false. Therefore, according to the rule of modus tollens, the conclusion 'The doll was not plastic' (P is false) is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
