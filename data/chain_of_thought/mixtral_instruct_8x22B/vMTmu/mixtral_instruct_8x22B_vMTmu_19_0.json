            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical structure known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens has the following structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen must have watched basketball\". The first premise is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\", which matches the form of the first statement in modus tollens. The second premise is \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball\", which matches the form of the second statement in modus tollens. The conclusion is \"Tom did not watch football\", which matches the form of the conclusion in modus tollens.\n\nSince the argument matches the form of modus tollens, and modus tollens is a valid form of argument, this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
