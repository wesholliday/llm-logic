            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical construct known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens has the following structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy must have played tennis\". The first premise is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis\", which matches the form of the first statement in modus tollens. The second premise is \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis\", which matches the form of the second statement in modus tollens. The conclusion is \"Jeff did not play basketball\", which matches the form of the conclusion in modus tollens.\n\nSince the argument matches the form of modus tollens, and modus tollens is a valid form of argument, this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
