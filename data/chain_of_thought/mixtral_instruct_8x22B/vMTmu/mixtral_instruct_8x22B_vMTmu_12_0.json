            "content": " Explanation: This argument is in the form of a logical construct known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens has the following structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo\". The first premise is \"If P, then Q\", the second premise is \"Not Q\", and the conclusion is \"Therefore, not P\". Since this argument follows the structure of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
