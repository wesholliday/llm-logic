However, just because the conclusion is true (the cat was outside), we cannot infer that the hypothesis is true (the dog was inside) without additional information. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. In logic, the truth of the conclusion does not imply the truth of the hypothesis.\n\nAnswer: No.",
