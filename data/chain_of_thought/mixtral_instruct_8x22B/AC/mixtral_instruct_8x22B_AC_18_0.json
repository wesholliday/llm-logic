The given information \"The truck was metal\" is the same as the conclusion of the conditional statement. However, just because the conclusion is true, we cannot infer that the hypothesis is true. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The doll was plastic\" based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
