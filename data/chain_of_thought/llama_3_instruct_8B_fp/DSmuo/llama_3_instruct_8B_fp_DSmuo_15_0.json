The statement \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door\" presents two mutually exclusive options: either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door. Since we know that the shoes must not be lined up by the door, we can conclude that the shoes must be in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
