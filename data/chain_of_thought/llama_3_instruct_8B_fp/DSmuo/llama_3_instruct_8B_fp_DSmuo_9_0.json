            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements. The first statement \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor\" implies that the missing puzzle piece cannot be blending in on the floor. The second statement \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor\" is a disjunction, which means it is a statement that says that one of the two options must be true. Since we know that the missing puzzle piece cannot be blending in on the floor, we can conclude that the other option, \"the missing puzzle piece is in the box\", must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
