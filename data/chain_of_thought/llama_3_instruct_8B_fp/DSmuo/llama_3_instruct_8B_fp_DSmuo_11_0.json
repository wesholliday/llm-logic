The first statement \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch\" implies that the newspaper's being on the porch is not a necessary condition. The second statement \"Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch\" presents a dichotomy, stating that the newspaper is either in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch.
