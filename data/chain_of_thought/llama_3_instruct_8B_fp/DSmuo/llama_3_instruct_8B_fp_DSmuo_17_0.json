The first statement \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack\" tells us that the scarf is not necessarily on the coat rack. The second statement \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack\" gives us two options for the scarf's location: either it's in the backpack or it's on the coat rack. Since we know the scarf is not necessarily on the coat rack, we can conclude that it must be in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
