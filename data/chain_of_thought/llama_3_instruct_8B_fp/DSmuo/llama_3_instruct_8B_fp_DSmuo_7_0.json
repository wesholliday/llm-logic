The first statement \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet\" tells us that the umbrella is not necessarily in the closet. The second statement \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet\" gives us two options: either the umbrella is in the car or it is in the closet. Since we know that it's not necessarily in the closet, we can conclude that it must be in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
