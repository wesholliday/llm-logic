The first statement \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist\" tells us that the watch being on his wrist is not a necessary condition. The second statement \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist\" presents us with two possibilities: either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist. Since we know that the watch being on his wrist is not a necessary condition, we can conclude that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
