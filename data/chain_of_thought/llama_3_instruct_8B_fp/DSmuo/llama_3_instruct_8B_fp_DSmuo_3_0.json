The first statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" tells us that the keys do not have to be in the cabinet. The second statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" presents us with two possibilities: either the keys are in the drawer or they must be in the cabinet. Since we know that the keys do not have to be in the cabinet, we can conclude that they must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
