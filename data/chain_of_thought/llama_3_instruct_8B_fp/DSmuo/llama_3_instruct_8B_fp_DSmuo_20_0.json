The first statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" tells us that the sunglasses are not necessarily perched on her head. The second statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" gives us two possibilities: either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head. Since we know that the sunglasses are not necessarily perched on her head, we can conclude that they must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
