            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements. The first statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that the toy is not necessarily sitting on the bookshelf. The second statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" provides two possible locations for the toy: the toy box or the bookshelf. Since the first statement tells us that the toy is not necessarily on the bookshelf, we can conclude that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
