The second statement \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk\" is a disjunction, which means that one of the two options must be true. Since we know that the pen is not necessarily on my desk, we can conclude that the pen must be in my bag. This is because the only other option is that the pen must be on my desk, which we know is not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
