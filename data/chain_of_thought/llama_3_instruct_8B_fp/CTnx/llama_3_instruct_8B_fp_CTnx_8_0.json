This statement is saying that if the sprocket was cranked, then it cannot be daggled at the same time. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the sprocket is daggled, then it cannot be cranked. The original statement only provides information about the relationship between being cranked and being daggled, but it does not provide information about the relationship between being daggled and being cranked.\n\nAnswer: no",
