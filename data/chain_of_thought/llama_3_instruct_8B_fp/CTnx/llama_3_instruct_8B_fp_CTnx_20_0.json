This statement is saying that if the fleeg is bluttered, then it cannot be surned. This is a logical relationship between the two states. To infer the opposite, we need to use the same logical relationship. If we assume that the fleeg surned, then we can conclude that it cannot be bluttered, because the two states are mutually exclusive. Therefore, we can infer that if the fleeg surned, then it was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
