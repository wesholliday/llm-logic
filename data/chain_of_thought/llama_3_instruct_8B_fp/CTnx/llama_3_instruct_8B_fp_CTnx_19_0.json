            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement, \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk did not plagged\". This statement is saying that if the smonk was vreebled, then it did not plagged. This implies that plagging and vreebling are mutually exclusive, meaning that if the smonk was vreebled, it could not have plagged, and vice versa.\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\", we need to apply the same logic. If the smonk plagged, then it could not have been vreebled, because plagging and vreebling are mutually exclusive. Therefore, if the smonk plagged, it must have been the opposite of vreebled, which is not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
