This is a classic example of a contrapositive, where the second clause is the negation of the first clause. To infer the second statement, we need to apply the same logic.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement would be: \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\". This is because the negation of \"the whiffle was shanked\" is \"the whiffle was not shanked\", and the negation of \"the whiffle did not tink\" is \"the whiffle tink\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
