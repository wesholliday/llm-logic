This statement is saying that if the flugel is blimmed, then it cannot be zargled at the same time. This is a logical relationship between the two states.\n\nTo infer the opposite conditional statement, \"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed\", we need to apply the same logical relationship. If the flugel is zargled, then it cannot be blimmed at the same time. This is a valid inference, as the same logical relationship applies.\n\nAnswer: yes",
