            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence \"The snork might be plonk\" implies that there is a possibility that the snork is plonk. However, it does not provide any information about other possibilities. To infer that the snork might be plonk or wobble, we would need additional information or context that suggests the snork could also be wobble.
