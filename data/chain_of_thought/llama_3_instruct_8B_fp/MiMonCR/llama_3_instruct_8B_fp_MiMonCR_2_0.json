            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence states that the recipe might be complicated, which implies that it may have multiple steps or components that need to be followed. The phrase \"and require exotic ingredients\" is added as a possible consequence of the recipe being complicated. The word \"and\" is used to indicate that the two clauses are related, suggesting that the requirement of exotic ingredients is a result of the recipe being complicated. Therefore, we can infer that the recipe might require exotic ingredients because it is complicated.\n\nAnswer: yes",
