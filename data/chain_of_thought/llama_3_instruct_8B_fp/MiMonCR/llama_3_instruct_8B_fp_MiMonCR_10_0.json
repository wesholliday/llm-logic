The word \"and\" suggests a causal relationship between the injury and the inability to compete. Therefore, we can infer that the athlete's inability to compete is a direct result of their injury. This implies that if the athlete is indeed injured, they would also be unable to compete. However, the original statement does not provide any information about the athlete's ability to compete in the absence of an injury.",
