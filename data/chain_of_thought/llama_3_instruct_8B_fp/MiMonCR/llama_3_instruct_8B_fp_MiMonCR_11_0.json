            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence states that the contract \"might be legally binding and have hidden clauses\". This implies that the contract has the potential to be legally binding, and one of the possible reasons for this is that it has hidden clauses. The phrase \"and have hidden clauses\" is providing additional information about what makes the contract potentially legally binding. Therefore, we can infer that the contract might have hidden clauses because it is one of the possible reasons why it might be legally binding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
