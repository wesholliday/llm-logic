            "content": "Explanation: The given sentence states that the meeting \"might be confidential\", which implies that the meeting's nature or content is not publicly disclosed. The second part of the sentence states that the meeting \"involve important decisions\", which suggests that the meeting's purpose is to make significant decisions. The use of \"might\" in the first part of the sentence indicates that the meeting's confidentiality is not certain, but the second part of the sentence provides additional information about the meeting's purpose. We can infer that the meeting might involve important decisions because the sentence provides a reason for the meeting's confidentiality, which is to discuss important decisions.\n\nAnswer: yes",
