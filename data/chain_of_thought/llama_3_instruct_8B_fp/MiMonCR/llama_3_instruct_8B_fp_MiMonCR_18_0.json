            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence states that the election \"might be close\", which implies that the outcome is uncertain or could go either way. The phrase \"and require a recount\" is a consequence of this uncertainty, suggesting that if the election is close, a recount might be necessary to determine the winner. The word \"might\" in the original sentence is a modal verb that indicates possibility, not certainty. Therefore, we can infer that the election might require a recount, but we cannot conclude that it will definitely require one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
