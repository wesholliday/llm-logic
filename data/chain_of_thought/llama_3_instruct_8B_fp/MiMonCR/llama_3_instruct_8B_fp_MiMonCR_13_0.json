The word \"revolutionary\" implies that the technology is significant and impactful, and the phrase \"change the industry\" suggests that the technology will have a profound effect on the industry. However, the sentence does not explicitly state that the technology will change the industry, but rather that it might be revolutionary and change the industry.
