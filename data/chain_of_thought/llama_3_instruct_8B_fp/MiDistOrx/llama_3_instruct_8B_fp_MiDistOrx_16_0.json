The use of the word \"or\" indicates that these are mutually exclusive options, and the snorkel can only be one of the two. The sentence is not saying that the snorkel might be both \"flibbit wibble\" and \"flump wibble\" at the same time, but rather that it might be one or the other.\n\nAnswer: yes",
