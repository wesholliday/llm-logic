            "content": "Explanation: The argument is an example of a categorical syllogism, specifically a modus ponens argument. The first premise is an \"if-then\" statement, which sets up a conditional relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence at the wedding. The second premise states that Sue was indeed at the wedding. The conclusion then logically follows that Mary must have been at the wedding as well, since the first premise established a necessary connection between the two.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it follows the correct form of a categorical syllogism. The conclusion logically follows from the premises, and there is no logical contradiction or flaw in the reasoning. The argument is a straightforward application of the modus ponens rule, which states that if P implies Q, and Q is true, then P must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
