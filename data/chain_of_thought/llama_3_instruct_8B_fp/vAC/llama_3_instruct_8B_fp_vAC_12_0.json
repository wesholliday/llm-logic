However, the argument is not logically valid because the first premise is not true. The first premise states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo, but this does not mean that if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park. The conclusion is trying to reverse the direction of the conditional statement, which is not allowed.\n\nAnswer: no",
