This implies that the sneg might not have sproted the frink.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that if the sneg was crampled, then it must have sproted the frink. This implies that if the sneg was crampled, then it is certain that the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nNow, we want to infer whether the sneg was not crampled. To do this, we need to combine the information from both statements. If the sneg was not crampled, then it is possible that the sneg did not sproted the frink (from statement 1). However, if the sneg was crampled, then it must have sproted the frink (from statement 2). Since we don't know whether the sneg was crampled or not, we cannot conclude that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: no",
