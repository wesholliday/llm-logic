This means that the dreb might not have been spened.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that if the dreb was vroombed, then it must have been spened. This implies that vroombed and spened are related in some way.\n\nNow, let's try to infer \"The dreb was not vroombed\". \n\nIf the dreb was not spened (as stated in statement 1), then it cannot be vroombed (since vroombed implies spened, as stated in statement 2). \n\nHowever, we cannot conclude that the dreb was not vroombed. The dreb might have been vroombed, but not spened. We don't have enough information to rule out this possibility.\n\nAnswer: no",
