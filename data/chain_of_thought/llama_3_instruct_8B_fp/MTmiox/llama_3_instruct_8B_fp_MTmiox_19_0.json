We want to infer whether \"The smonk was not vreebled\" is true.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the possibility of the smonk not plagging is not ruled out. This does not provide any information about the smonk's vreebled status.\n\nThe second statement provides a conditional relationship between the smonk's vreebled status and plagging. If the smonk is vreebled, then it must have plagged. However, this does not provide any information about the smonk's vreebled status when it has not plagged.\n\nSince we do not have any information about the smonk's vreebled status when it has not plagged, we cannot infer whether \"The smonk was not vreebled\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
