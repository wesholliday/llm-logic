We want to infer whether \"The flugel was not blimmed\" can be concluded from these statements.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the possibility of the flugel not being zargled is not ruled out. This does not provide any information about the flugel being blimmed.\n\nThe second statement provides a conditional relationship between the flugel being blimmed and the flugel being zargled. However, this does not provide any direct information about the flugel not being blimmed.\n\nWe cannot conclude that the flugel was not blimmed because the statements do not provide any evidence or logical connection to support this conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
