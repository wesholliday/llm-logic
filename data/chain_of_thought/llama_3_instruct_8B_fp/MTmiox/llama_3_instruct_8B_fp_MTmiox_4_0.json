However, we cannot directly infer that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nThe key point is that the first statement only provides a possibility that the fribble might not have crinked, but it does not provide any information about whether the fribble was snurgled or not. The second statement only provides a conditional relationship between being snurgled and crinked, but it does not provide any information about the fribble's actual state.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The fribble was not snurgled\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
