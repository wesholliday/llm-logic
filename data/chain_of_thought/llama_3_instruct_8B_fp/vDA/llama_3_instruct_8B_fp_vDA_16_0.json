However, the first premise only states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim, which does not provide any information about what happens when the shirt is not cotton. The conclusion is trying to make a claim about the pants based on the shirt's material, but the premises do not provide any logical connection between the two.\n\nAnswer: no",
