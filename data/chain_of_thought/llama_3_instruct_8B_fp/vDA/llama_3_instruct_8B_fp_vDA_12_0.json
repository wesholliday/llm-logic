            "content": "Explanation: The argument is an example of a conditional argument, where the first premise is a conditional statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\". The second premise is a negation of the antecedent \"Joe did not go to the park\". The conclusion is the negation of the consequent \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\". The argument is trying to use the conditional statement to make an inference about Lucy's action based on Joe's action.\n\nThe key question is whether the argument is logically valid. A valid argument is one where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, and the conclusion is true if the premises are true.\n\nIn this case, the argument is valid because the conditional statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" implies that if Joe did not go to the park, Lucy did not go to the zoo. The second premise \"Joe did not go to the park\" provides the necessary condition for the conclusion to follow. Therefore, the conclusion \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
