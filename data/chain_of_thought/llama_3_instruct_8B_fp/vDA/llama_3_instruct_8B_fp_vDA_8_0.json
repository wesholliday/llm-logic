            "content": "Explanation: The argument is an example of a categorical syllogism, specifically a modus tollens argument. The first premise is an \"if-then\" statement, which sets up a conditional relationship between the vampire's wakefulness and the mummy's wakefulness. The second premise is a negation of the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the first premise, which is the vampire's wakefulness. The conclusion is the negation of the consequent (the \"then\" part) of the first premise, which is the mummy's wakefulness.\n\nThe argument follows the correct form of modus tollens, where the negation of the antecedent (the vampire's wakefulness) leads to the negation of the consequent (the mummy's wakefulness). This is a logically valid form of argument, as it is impossible to construct a counterexample that would make the conclusion false while the premises are true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
