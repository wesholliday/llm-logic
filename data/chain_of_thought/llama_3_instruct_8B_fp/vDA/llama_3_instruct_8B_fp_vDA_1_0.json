            "content": "Explanation: The argument is an example of a modus tollens argument, which is a valid form of argument. The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. The second premise states that Mary was not at the wedding. The conclusion is that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nThe argument follows the correct form of modus tollens, which is:\n\nIf A, then B\nNot A\n\u2234 Not B\n\nIn this case, A is \"Mary was at the wedding\", B is \"Sue was at the wedding\", and the conclusion is \"Sue was not at the wedding\".\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it follows the correct form of modus tollens, and the premises are consistent with each other. If Mary was not at the wedding, then it is logically consistent to conclude that Sue was not at the wedding as well.\n\nAnswer: yes",
