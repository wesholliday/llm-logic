It's saying that it's not necessary for the watch to be charging on the dresser. This doesn't necessarily mean that the watch might not be charging on the dresser, but rather that it's not required to be charging on the dresser. The watch could still be charging on the dresser, but it's not a necessary condition.\n\nAnswer: no",
