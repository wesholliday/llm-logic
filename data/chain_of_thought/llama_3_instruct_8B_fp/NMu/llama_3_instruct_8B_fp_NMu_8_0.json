It's saying that it's not necessary for the vampire to have been awake. This does not necessarily imply that the vampire might not have been awake. The vampire could have been awake, but it's not necessary for them to have been. The statement is saying that there's no requirement for the vampire to have been awake, not that it's possible for them not to have been awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
