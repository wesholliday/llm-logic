This negation does not necessarily imply that the milk might not be on the counter. For example, it could be the case that the milk is on the counter, but it's not the case that it must be there. The statement only tells us that the milk's presence on the counter is not obligatory, but it doesn't provide any information about its actual location.\n\nAnswer: no",
