It's not saying that Alex definitely didn't finish the race, just that there's no certainty about it. This statement is leaving open the possibility that Alex might have finished the race, but it's not ruling out the possibility that they might not have finished it either.\n\nThe statement is not making a claim about the probability or likelihood of Alex finishing the race, it's just saying that there's no guarantee. Therefore, we can't infer that Alex might not have finished the race, because the statement is not providing any information about the likelihood of Alex not finishing the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
