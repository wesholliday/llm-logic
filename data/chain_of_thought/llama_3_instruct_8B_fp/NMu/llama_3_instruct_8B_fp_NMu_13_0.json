            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" is saying that the toy's presence in the toy box is not a necessary condition. This does not necessarily mean that the toy is not in the toy box, but rather that it's possible for the toy to be elsewhere. The statement is negating the idea that the toy's presence is mandatory, not that it's impossible for the toy to be in the toy box.\n\nThe statement is not making a claim about the toy's actual location, but rather about the necessity of its location. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that the toy might not be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: no",
