This negation does not necessarily imply that the notebook might not be in the drawer. For example, it could be the case that the notebook is in the drawer, but it's not the case that it must be in the drawer. The statement only tells us that the notebook's presence in the drawer is not obligatory, but it doesn't provide any information about the notebook's actual location.\n\nAnswer: no",
