It's saying that it's not necessary for the alien to have visited Mars. This does not necessarily imply that the alien might not have visited Mars. The alien could have visited Mars, but it's not necessary that they did. The statement only rules out the necessity of the alien visiting Mars, not the possibility.\n\nAnswer: no",
