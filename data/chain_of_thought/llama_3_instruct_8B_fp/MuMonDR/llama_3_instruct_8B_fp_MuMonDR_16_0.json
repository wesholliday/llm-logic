            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The room must have been cleaned daily\" implies that the room was cleaned at a regular interval, which is daily. However, it does not provide any information about whether the cleaning was done upon request or not. The statement only specifies the frequency of cleaning, not the trigger or motivation behind it. Therefore, we cannot infer that the room was cleaned upon request or daily, as the original statement does not provide enough information to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
