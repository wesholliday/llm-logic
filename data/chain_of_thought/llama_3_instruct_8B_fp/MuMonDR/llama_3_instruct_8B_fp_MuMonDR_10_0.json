            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The document must have been signed\" implies that the document has been authenticated or verified by the person who created it, which is the act of signing. However, it does not necessarily imply that the document was notarized, as notarization is a separate process that involves verification by a notary public. Notarization is not a requirement for signing a document, and many documents can be signed without being notarized. Therefore, we cannot infer that the document must have been notarized.\n\nAnswer: no",
