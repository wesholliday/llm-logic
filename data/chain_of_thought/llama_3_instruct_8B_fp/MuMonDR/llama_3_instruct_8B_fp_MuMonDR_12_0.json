However, it does not provide any information about whether the project was actually completed or not. It only sets a deadline. To infer that the project must have been extended or completed by Friday, we would need additional information that suggests the project was not completed by the original deadline. The original statement does not provide that information, so we cannot make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
