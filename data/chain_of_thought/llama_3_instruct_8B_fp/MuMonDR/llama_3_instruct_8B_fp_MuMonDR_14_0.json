However, it does not explicitly state whether the contract was renewable or not. The contract could have been a one-time agreement that was valid for a year, or it could have been a renewable contract that was valid for a year or more. The original statement does not provide enough information to determine whether the contract was renewable or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
