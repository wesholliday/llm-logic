However, it does not explicitly mention the possibility of subtitles. To infer that the movie must have been subtitled or in English, we would need additional information or context that suggests the presence of subtitles. Without that information, we can only conclude that the movie was spoken in English, but not necessarily that it had subtitles.\n\nAnswer: no",
