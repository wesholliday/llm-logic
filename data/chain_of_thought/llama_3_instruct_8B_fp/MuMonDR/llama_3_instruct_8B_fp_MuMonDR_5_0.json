            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package must have been delivered today\" implies that the package was delivered on the current day. However, it does not provide any information about the package's delivery on previous days. To infer that the package must have been delivered tomorrow or today, we would need additional information or context that suggests the package was not delivered on previous days.
