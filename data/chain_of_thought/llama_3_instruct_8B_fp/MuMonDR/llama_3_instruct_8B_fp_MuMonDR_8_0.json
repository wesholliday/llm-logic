However, it does not provide information about the restaurant's operating hours on other days of the week. Therefore, we cannot infer that the restaurant was open for limited hours or closed on Mondays because the original statement only provides information about the restaurant's closure on Mondays, not its operating hours on other days.\n\nAnswer: no",
