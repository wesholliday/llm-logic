However, the additional words \"glorp quank\" are not present in the original sentence, and there is no clear connection between these words and the original description of the wobble.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to infer that the wobble must also have the properties described by the words \"glorp quank\" because this information is not present in the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: no",
