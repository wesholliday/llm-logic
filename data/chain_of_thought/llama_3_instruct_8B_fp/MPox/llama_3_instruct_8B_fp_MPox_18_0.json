The conditional statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\" implies that if the shank was plooked, it must also be nugged. The premise \"The shank was plooked\" provides the condition for the conditional statement to be true. Since the premise is true, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that the shank was indeed nugged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
