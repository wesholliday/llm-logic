This implies that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true. In other words, if the glip was indeed slogged, then it must also have been tragged.\n\nHowever, the original statement \"The glip was slogged\" is not necessarily true. It's just a premise, and we don't have any evidence to support or deny it. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that \"The glip was tragged\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
