The conditional statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" implies that if the condition \"the fleeg was bluttered\" is true, then the consequent \"it surned\" must also be true. However, the original statement \"The fleeg was bluttered\" does not provide any information about whether the condition is true or not. Therefore, we cannot directly infer the consequent \"The fleeg surned\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
