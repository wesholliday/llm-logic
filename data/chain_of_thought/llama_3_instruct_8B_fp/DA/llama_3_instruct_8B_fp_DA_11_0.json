The cake was not chocolate.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the cake is not chocolate, then the muffins are not blueberry. This is because the statement is a conditional statement, and the antecedent (\"the cake was chocolate\") is negated in statement 2.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly conclude that the muffins were not blueberry from the given statements. We can only conclude that the muffins are not blueberry if the cake is not chocolate, but we don't know the actual color of the muffins.\n\nAnswer: no",
