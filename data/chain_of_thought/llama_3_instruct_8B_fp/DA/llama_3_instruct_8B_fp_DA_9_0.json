We want to know if we can infer \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\". To do this, we need to analyze the given statements and see if they provide enough information to conclude that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Lisa bought the red shirt) is false, then the consequence (Mark bought the blue shirt) is also false. However, the condition is false because Lisa did not buy the red shirt (according to the second statement). Therefore, the consequence is also false, which means that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
