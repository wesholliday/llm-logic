            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" and \"Tom did not watch football\". We need to determine if we can infer \"Jen did not watch basketball\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. However, this statement does not provide any information about what happens if Tom did not watch football. The second statement tells us that Tom did not watch football, but it does not provide any information about Jen's actions.\n\nSince we do not have any additional information about Jen's actions, we cannot infer that Jen did not watch basketball. We can only conclude that Jen might have watched basketball, but we do not have enough information to make a definitive statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
