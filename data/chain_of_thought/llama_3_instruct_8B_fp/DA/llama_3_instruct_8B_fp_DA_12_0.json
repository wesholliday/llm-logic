            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are:\n\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\n2. Joe did not go to the park\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo. This is because the conditional statement implies a causal relationship between Joe's action and Lucy's action. If Joe does not go to the park, then Lucy will not go to the zoo.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo from statement 2 alone. Statement 2 only tells us that Joe did not go to the park, but it does not provide any information about Lucy's action.\n\nTo infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo, we need to combine both statements. Since Joe did not go to the park, and if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would have gone to the zoo, we can conclude that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: yes",
