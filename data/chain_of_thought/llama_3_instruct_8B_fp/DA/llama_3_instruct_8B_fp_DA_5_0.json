            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" and \"Jeff did not play basketball\". We want to know if we can infer that \"Amy did not play tennis\". To do this, we need to analyze the given statements and see if we can logically conclude that Amy did not play tennis.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Jeff playing basketball) is not met, then the consequence (Amy playing tennis) is also not met. In this case, the condition is not met, since \"Jeff did not play basketball\". Therefore, we can conclude that Amy did not play tennis.\n\nAnswer: yes",
