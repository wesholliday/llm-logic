            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and \"The apple was not red\". The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the apple being red) is true, then the consequent (the banana being yellow) must also be true. However, the second statement tells us that the antecedent is actually false (the apple is not red). This means that the conditional statement is not applicable, and we cannot conclude that the banana is yellow.\n\nSince we cannot conclude that the banana is yellow, we cannot infer that the banana is not yellow either. The original conditional statement only provides a relationship between the apple being red and the banana being yellow, but it does not provide any information about the banana's color when the apple is not red.\n\nAnswer: no",
