We want to know if we can infer that \"The wolf was not in the den\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf is in the den. However, this does not mean that if the bear is not in the cave, then the wolf is not in the den. There could be other reasons why the wolf is in the den, unrelated to the bear's presence in the cave.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the bear is not in the cave. But this does not provide any direct information about the wolf's presence in the den. We cannot conclude that the wolf is not in the den just because the bear is not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: no",
