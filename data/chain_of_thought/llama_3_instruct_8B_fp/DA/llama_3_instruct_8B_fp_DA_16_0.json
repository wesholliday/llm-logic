            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" and \"The shirt was not cotton\". The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the shirt being cotton) is false, then the consequent (the pants being denim) is also false. The second statement tells us that the antecedent is indeed false, since the shirt is not cotton. Therefore, we can conclude that the pants are not denim, since the consequent of the conditional statement is also false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
