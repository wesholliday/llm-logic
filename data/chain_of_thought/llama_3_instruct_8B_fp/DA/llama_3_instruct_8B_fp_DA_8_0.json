We need to determine if we can infer \"The mummy was not awake\" from these statements.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake. However, this does not provide any information about the mummy's state when the vampire is not awake.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the vampire is not awake. But this does not necessarily mean that the mummy is not awake. The mummy could still be awake even if the vampire is not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The mummy was not awake\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
