We need to determine if we can infer \"The book is not a mystery novel\" from these statements.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. However, the second statement tells us that the book was not written by James. This means that the condition \"the book was written by James\" is not met.\n\nSince the condition is not met, we cannot conclude that the book is a mystery novel. The first statement only provides a relationship between the book being written by James and the book being a mystery novel, but it does not provide a relationship between the book not being written by James and the book not being a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: no",
