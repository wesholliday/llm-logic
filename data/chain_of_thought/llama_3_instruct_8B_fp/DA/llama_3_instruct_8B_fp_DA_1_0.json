            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Mary was not at the wedding\". The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is not met, then the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) cannot be inferred. The second statement tells us that the condition is not met, since Mary was not at the wedding. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about Sue's presence at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
