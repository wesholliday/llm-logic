            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" and \"The doll was not plastic\". We need to determine if we can infer \"The truck was not metal\" from these statements.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. However, the second statement tells us that the doll is not plastic. This means that the condition \"the doll is plastic\" is not met, and therefore we cannot conclude that the truck is metal.\n\nHowever, the first statement does not provide any information about what happens when the doll is not plastic. It only talks about the relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the truck's material based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
