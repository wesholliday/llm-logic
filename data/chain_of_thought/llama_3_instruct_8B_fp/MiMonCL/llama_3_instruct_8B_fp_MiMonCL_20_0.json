The phrase \"might be accidental\" is already present in the sentence, which explicitly mentions the possibility of the discovery being accidental. The additional information about the Nobel Prize is not relevant to the inference we are trying to make, as it only provides a consequence of the discovery being accidental, not the discovery itself being accidental. Therefore, we can directly infer that the discovery might be accidental.\n\nAnswer: yes",
