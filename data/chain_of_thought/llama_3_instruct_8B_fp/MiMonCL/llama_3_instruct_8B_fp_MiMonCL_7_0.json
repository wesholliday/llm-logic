            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The investment might be risky and offer high returns\" is a compound sentence that combines two clauses. The first clause \"The investment might be risky\" is a standalone statement that conveys a possibility of the investment being risky. The second clause \"offer high returns\" is a separate statement that conveys a potential benefit of the investment. The conjunction \"and\" connects the two clauses, indicating that both statements are related to the same investment. However, the presence of the second clause \"offer high returns\" does not necessarily imply the truth of the first clause \"The investment might be risky\". The two clauses are independent, and the truth of one does not guarantee the truth of the other.\n\nAnswer: yes",
