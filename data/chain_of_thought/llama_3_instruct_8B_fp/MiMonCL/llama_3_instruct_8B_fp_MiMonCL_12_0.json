            "content": "Explanation: The given sentence is a complex sentence, where the main clause is \"The contract might be legally binding\" and the subordinate clause is \"and have hidden clauses\". The word \"and\" is used to connect the two clauses, indicating that the two clauses are related. The presence of the subordinate clause \"and have hidden clauses\" provides additional information about the main clause \"The contract might be legally binding\". The phrase \"have hidden clauses\" implies that the contract may have some clauses that are not explicitly stated, which could affect its legal binding nature. Therefore, we can infer that the contract might be legally binding because the presence of hidden clauses could impact its legal binding status.\n\nAnswer: yes",
