            "content": "Explanation: The sentence states that the event \"might be formal or semi-formal\", which implies that the event could be either formal or semi-formal, but not necessarily one or the other. The use of the word \"or\" suggests that both options are possible, and the phrase \"might be\" indicates that the event's formality is uncertain. Therefore, we can infer that the event could indeed be semi-formal, as it is one of the two possibilities mentioned.\n\nAnswer: yes",
