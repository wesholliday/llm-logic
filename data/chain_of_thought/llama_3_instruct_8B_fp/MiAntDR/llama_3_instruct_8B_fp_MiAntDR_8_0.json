            "content": "Explanation: The given statement mentions that the restaurant \"might be closed on Mondays\" which implies that there is a possibility that the restaurant is closed on Mondays. Additionally, it also mentions that the restaurant \"might be open for limited hours\" which implies that there is a possibility that the restaurant is open for limited hours. The use of \"might\" in both cases indicates that these are possibilities, not certainties. Therefore, we can infer that the restaurant might be open for limited hours, but we cannot conclude that it definitely is.\n\nAnswer: yes",
