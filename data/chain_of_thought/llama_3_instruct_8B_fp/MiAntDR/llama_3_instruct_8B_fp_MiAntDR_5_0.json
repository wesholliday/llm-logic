            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package might be delivered today or tomorrow\" implies that there are two possible days when the package might be delivered. The word \"or\" is used to indicate that both options are possible, but not mutually exclusive. This means that the package might be delivered on either today or tomorrow, or possibly even on both days. Therefore, we can infer that the package might indeed be delivered tomorrow, as it is one of the possible days mentioned in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
