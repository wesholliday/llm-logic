The word \"or\" is used to indicate a choice between two alternatives. Since \"English\" is one of the options, it is likely that \"subtitled\" is also a possibility. However, the statement does not explicitly state that the movie will be subtitled, it only presents it as one of the possible options.\n\nAnswer: yes",
