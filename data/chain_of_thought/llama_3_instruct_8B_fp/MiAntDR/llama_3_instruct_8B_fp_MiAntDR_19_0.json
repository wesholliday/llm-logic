This implies that there are two possible ways to complete the application, one of which is in person. The use of the word \"or\" indicates that both options are mutually exclusive, meaning that the application cannot be completed both online and in person at the same time. Therefore, we can infer that the application can indeed be completed in person.\n\nAnswer: yes",
