            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence \"The keys might be in the drawer or on the table\" presents two possible locations where the keys could be: the drawer and the table. The use of the word \"or\" indicates that these are mutually exclusive options, meaning that the keys cannot be in both places at the same time. Therefore, we can infer that the keys might be on the table, as it is one of the explicitly mentioned possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes",
