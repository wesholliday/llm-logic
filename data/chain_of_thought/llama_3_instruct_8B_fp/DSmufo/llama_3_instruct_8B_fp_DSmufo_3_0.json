The first statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" tells us that the keys are not necessarily dangling in the cabinet. The second statement \"Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer\" presents us with two possibilities: either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer. Since we know that the keys are not necessarily dangling in the cabinet, we can conclude that they must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
