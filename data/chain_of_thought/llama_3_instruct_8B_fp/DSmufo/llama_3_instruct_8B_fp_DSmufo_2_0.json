            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements. The first statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" implies that the book is not necessarily resting on the table. The second statement \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf\" is a disjunction, which means that one of the two options must be true. Since the first statement tells us that the book is not necessarily resting on the table, we can conclude that the second option \"it is on the shelf\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
