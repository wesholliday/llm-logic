The first statement \"It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door\" tells us that the shoes do not have to be lined up by the door. The second statement \"Either the shoes must be lined up by the door or they are in the closet\" gives us two options: either the shoes must be lined up by the door or they are in the closet. Since we know that the shoes do not have to be lined up by the door, we can conclude that the second option is true, i.e., the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
