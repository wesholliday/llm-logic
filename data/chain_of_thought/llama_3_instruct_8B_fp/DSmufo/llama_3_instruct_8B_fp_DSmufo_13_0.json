            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements. The first statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that the toy is not necessarily sitting on the bookshelf. The second statement \"Either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box\" is a disjunction, which means it is a statement that says one of the two options is true. Since the first statement tells us that the toy is not necessarily sitting on the bookshelf, we can conclude that the second option \"it is in the toy box\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
