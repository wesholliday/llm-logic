            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements. The first statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" implies that the milk is not necessarily in the fridge. The second statement \"Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter\" is a disjunction, which means that one of the two options must be true. Since the first statement tells us that the milk is not necessarily in the fridge, we can conclude that the second option \"it is on the counter\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
