The first statement \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist\" tells us that the watch is not necessarily on his wrist. The second statement \"Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser\" gives us two possibilities: either the watch is on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser. Since we know that the watch is not necessarily on his wrist, we can conclude that it must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
