The first statement \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom\" implies that the cat is not necessarily playing in the bedroom. The second statement \"Either the cat must be playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch\" is a disjunction, which means that one of the two options must be true. Since we know that the cat is not necessarily playing in the bedroom, we can conclude that the other option, \"it's napping on the couch\", must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
