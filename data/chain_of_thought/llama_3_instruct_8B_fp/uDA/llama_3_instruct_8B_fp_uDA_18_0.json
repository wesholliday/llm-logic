However, the statement \"the doll was not plastic\" does not provide any direct information about the material of the truck. The fact that the doll is not plastic does not necessarily mean that the truck is not metal. The original statement only established a relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal, but it did not establish a relationship between the doll not being plastic and the truck not being metal.\n\nAnswer: no",
