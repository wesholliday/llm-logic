            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" implies a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. This means that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we cannot conclude that Mark bought the blue shirt. The statement \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" is a fact that contradicts the initial condition, so we cannot apply the conditional relationship to draw a conclusion about Mark's purchase.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. There is no additional information that suggests Mark's purchase of the blue shirt is dependent on Lisa's purchase of the red shirt. Mark's purchase of the blue shirt could still be independent of Lisa's purchase.\n\nAnswer: no",
