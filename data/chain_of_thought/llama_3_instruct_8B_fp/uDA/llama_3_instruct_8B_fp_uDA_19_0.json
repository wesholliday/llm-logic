            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Tom watching football) is not met, the consequence (Jen watching basketball) may not necessarily be true. The statement \"Tom did not watch football\" is a fact that contradicts the condition. Therefore, we cannot directly conclude that Jen watched basketball.\n\nHowever, we can use the original conditional statement to make an inference. Since Tom did not watch football, the condition is not met, and we cannot conclude that Jen watched basketball. We can only say that we don't know whether Jen watched basketball or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
