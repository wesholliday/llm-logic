However, the statement \"Ben did not eat pasta\" is a separate statement that does not directly relate to Kate eating salad.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can conclude that if Ben did not eat pasta, it does not necessarily mean Kate did not eat salad. The condition \"Ben ate pasta\" is not met, so we cannot infer anything about Kate's eating habits.\n\nAnswer: no",
