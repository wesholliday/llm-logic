            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" and \"The griffin was not in the forest\". We need to use logical deduction to determine if we can infer that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is also in the forest. However, this does not provide any information about the unicorn's presence in the forest when the griffin is not in the forest.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the griffin is not in the forest. This does not provide any direct information about the unicorn's presence in the forest.\n\nSince we don't have any additional information that links the griffin's absence to the unicorn's presence or absence, we cannot infer that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no",
