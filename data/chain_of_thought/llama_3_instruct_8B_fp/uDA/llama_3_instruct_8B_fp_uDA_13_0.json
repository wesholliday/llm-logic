However, the statement \"the car was not red\" is a contradictory statement, which means that the car cannot be red. Since the car cannot be red, the conditional statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is no longer applicable. Therefore, we cannot infer that the truck was not blue.\n\nAnswer: no",
