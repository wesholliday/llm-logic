We need to use these statements to infer whether Chris finished the race or not.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished the race. But we are also given that Alex did not finish the race. This means that the condition \"Alex finished the race\" is not true.\n\nSince the condition is not true, we cannot conclude that Chris finished the race. We cannot infer that Chris did not finish the race either, because we don't have any information about Chris's finishing status.\n\nAnswer: no",
