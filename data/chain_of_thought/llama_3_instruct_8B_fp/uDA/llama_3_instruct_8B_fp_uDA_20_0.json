However, the statement \"the apple was not red\" is a contradictory statement that negates the condition. This means that the condition (the apple being red) is actually false.\n\nSince the condition is false, we cannot apply the conditional statement to conclude that the banana is yellow. In fact, the statement \"the banana was yellow\" is no longer supported by the evidence. Therefore, we cannot infer that the banana was not yellow.\n\nAnswer: no",
