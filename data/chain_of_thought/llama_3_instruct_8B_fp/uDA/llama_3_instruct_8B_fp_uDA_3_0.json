This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the book was written by James) is true, then the consequence (the book is a mystery novel) must also be true. 2) The book was not written by James. This is a statement that contradicts the condition in the first statement.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that the condition (the book was written by James) is false. Since the condition is false, the consequence (the book is a mystery novel) must also be false. Therefore, we can infer that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: yes",
