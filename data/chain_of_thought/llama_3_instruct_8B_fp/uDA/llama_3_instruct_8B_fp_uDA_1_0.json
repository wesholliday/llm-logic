            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Mary was not at the wedding\". We need to analyze these statements to see if we can infer anything about Sue's presence at the wedding.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) is also true. However, the condition is not true, since we know that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nThe second statement simply tells us that Mary was not at the wedding, which is a fact.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot directly infer anything about Sue's presence at the wedding. The first statement only tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding, but since Mary was not at the wedding, this statement does not provide any information about Sue's presence.\n\nAnswer: no",
