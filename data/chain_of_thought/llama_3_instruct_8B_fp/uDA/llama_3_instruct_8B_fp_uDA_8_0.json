            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" and \"The vampire was not awake\". We need to use logical deduction to infer the state of the mummy.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake. This implies that the mummy's state is dependent on the vampire's state.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the vampire is not awake. This means that the vampire's state is not awake.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. Since the vampire is not awake, and the mummy's state is dependent on the vampire's state, we can conclude that the mummy's state is also not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
