However, the statement \"Sue did not choose pizza\" is a contradictory statement that negates the condition. This means that the original condition \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is no longer applicable.\n\nSince Sue did not choose pizza, we cannot infer that Bob chose pasta. The original condition only established a relationship between Sue's choice of pizza and Bob's choice of pasta, but it did not establish a relationship between Sue's non-choice of pizza and Bob's choice.\n\nAnswer: no",
