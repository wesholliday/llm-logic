The second statement \"The fleeg was bluttered\" confirms that the condition is indeed true. However, the conclusion \"The fleeg surned\" is only guaranteed if the conditional statement is true, which is the case here. Therefore, we can logically infer that the conclusion is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
