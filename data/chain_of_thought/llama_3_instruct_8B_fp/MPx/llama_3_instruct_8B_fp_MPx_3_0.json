            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of conditional statements, where \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\". This implies that the quanking of the splat is dependent on the morphing of the splat. The second statement \"The splat was morphed\" provides additional information, stating that the condition in the conditional statement is indeed true. Therefore, we can conclude that the quanking of the splat is also true, as it is a direct consequence of the morphing.\n\nAnswer: yes",
