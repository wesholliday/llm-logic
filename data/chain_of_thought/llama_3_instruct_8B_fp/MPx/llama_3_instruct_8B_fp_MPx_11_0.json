The flug was blummed\n\nWe are trying to infer the conclusion 'The flug was zimmed' from these statements. To do this, we need to apply the principle of modus ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement 'If A, then B' and we know that A is true, then we can conclude that B is true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed', and we know that the flug was blummed (from statement 2). Therefore, we can apply modus ponens to conclude that the flug was zimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
