To infer the conclusion, we need to apply the modus ponens rule, which states that if we have a conditional statement and its antecedent, we can infer the consequent. In this case, the antecedent is \"The sneg was crampled\" and the consequent is \"The sneg sproted the frink\". If the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
