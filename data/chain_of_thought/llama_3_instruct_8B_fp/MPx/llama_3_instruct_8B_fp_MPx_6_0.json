The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the grommet was sploffed) is true, then the consequence (the grommet plopped the frink) must also be true. The second statement is a declarative statement, which simply states that the condition is true. Since the condition is true, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that the consequence must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
