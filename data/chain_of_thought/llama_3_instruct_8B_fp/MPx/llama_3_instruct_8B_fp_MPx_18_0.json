The shank was plooked.\n\nWe are trying to infer whether the shank was nugged. To do this, we need to use the first statement, which is a conditional statement. The conditional statement says that if the shank was plooked, then it was nugged. This means that plooking implies nugging.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the shank was indeed plooked. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement to this situation. Since the shank was plooked, and plooking implies nugging, we can conclude that the shank was nugged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
