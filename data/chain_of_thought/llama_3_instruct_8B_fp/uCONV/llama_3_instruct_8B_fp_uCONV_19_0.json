However, this statement does not imply a direct relationship between Jen watching basketball and Tom watching football. The original statement only establishes a connection between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball, but it does not provide any information about the reverse scenario.\n\nIn other words, the original statement does not provide any evidence that Tom's action (watching football) is directly related to Jen's action (watching basketball). Therefore, we cannot infer that if Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football.\n\nAnswer: no",
