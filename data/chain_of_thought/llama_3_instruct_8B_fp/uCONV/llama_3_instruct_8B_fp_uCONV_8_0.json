            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is a conditional statement, which implies that the vampire's wakefulness is a necessary condition for the mummy's wakefulness. This means that if the vampire is awake, the mummy must also be awake. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the mummy is awake, the vampire must also be awake.\n\nIn other words, the given statement only establishes a relationship between the vampire's wakefulness and the mummy's wakefulness in one direction, from the vampire to the mummy. It does not provide any information about the relationship in the reverse direction, from the mummy to the vampire.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
