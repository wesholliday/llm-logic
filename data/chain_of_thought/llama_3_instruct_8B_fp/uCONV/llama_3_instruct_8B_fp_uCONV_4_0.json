It does not necessarily mean that the robot visited Jupiter only when the alien visited Mars. It could be that the robot visited Jupiter for some other reason, and the alien happened to visit Mars at the same time. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: no",
