            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement, which means that it implies a cause-and-effect relationship between Mary's presence at the wedding and Sue's presence at the wedding. The statement is saying that if Mary is present, then Sue is also present. However, this does not necessarily mean that if Sue is present, then Mary is also present. The original statement does not provide any information about the relationship between Sue's presence and Mary's presence in the reverse direction.\n\nIn other words, the original statement only establishes a connection between Mary's presence and Sue's presence in one direction, but does not provide any information about the connection in the other direction. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
