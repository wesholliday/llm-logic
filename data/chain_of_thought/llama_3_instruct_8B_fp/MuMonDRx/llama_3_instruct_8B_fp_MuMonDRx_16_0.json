It does not provide any additional information about the plonk, such as alternatives or possibilities. The sentence is a simple statement of fact.\n\nIn order to infer that \"The plonk must be quimble flonk or flimble zibber\", we would need additional information or context that suggests the plonk can be either quimble flonk or flimble zibber. However, the original sentence does not provide this information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the additional information.\n\nAnswer: no",
