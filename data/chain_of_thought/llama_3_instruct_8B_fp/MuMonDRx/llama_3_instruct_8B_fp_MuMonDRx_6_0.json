However, we cannot infer that the zibber must be bimboozle or fizzle zibber because the original statement does not provide any information about the zibber's relationship with bimboozle. The original statement only mentions fizzle zibber, and we cannot assume that bimboozle is related to fizzle zibber without additional context.\n\nAnswer: no",
