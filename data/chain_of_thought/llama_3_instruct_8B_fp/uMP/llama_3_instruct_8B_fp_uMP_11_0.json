It implies that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry. The second statement \"The cake was chocolate\" is a separate statement that confirms the condition in the first statement. Since the condition is met, we can apply the relationship established in the first statement to infer the state of the muffins.\n\nAnswer: yes",
