The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the book was written by James) is true, then the consequence (the book is a mystery novel) is also true. The second statement confirms that the condition is indeed true, as it states that the book was written by James. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement to the known condition, and conclude that the consequence (the book is a mystery novel) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
