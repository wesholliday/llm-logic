The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Alex finished the race) is true, then the consequence (Chris finished the race) is also true. The second statement is a simple statement that confirms the condition (Alex finished the race) is indeed true. Since the condition is true, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that the consequence is also true. Therefore, we can infer that Chris finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
