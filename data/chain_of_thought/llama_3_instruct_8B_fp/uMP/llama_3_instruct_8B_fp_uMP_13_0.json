The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the car being red) is true, then the consequence (the truck being blue) must also be true. The second statement confirms that the condition is indeed true, as the car is indeed red. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement to the known condition, and conclude that the consequence must also be true. In this case, the consequence is that the truck is blue.\n\nAnswer: yes",
