            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Mary was at the wedding\". The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) is also true. The second statement simply states that Mary was at the wedding, which means the condition in the first statement is true. Therefore, we can apply the first statement to the situation and conclude that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. Since we know Mary was at the wedding, we can infer that Sue was also at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
