            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal. This implies that the truck being metal is dependent on the doll being plastic. The second statement \"The doll was plastic\" confirms that the doll is indeed plastic. However, this confirmation does not directly provide information about the truck's material. To infer that the truck is metal, we need to apply the conditional statement to the confirmed fact that the doll is plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
