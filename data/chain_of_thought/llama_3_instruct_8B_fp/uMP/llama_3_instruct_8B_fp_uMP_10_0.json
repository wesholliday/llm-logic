The statement \"the dog was inside\" is a separate statement that provides additional information. We can combine these two statements to infer the location of the cat. Since the dog was inside, and the condition is that if the dog is inside, then the cat is outside, we can conclude that the cat is indeed outside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
