The bear was in the cave.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that the wolf is in the den only when the bear is in the cave. This is a conditional statement, which means that the wolf's presence in the den is dependent on the bear's presence in the cave.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the bear is indeed in the cave.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly conclude that the wolf is in the den from statement 2 alone. We need to consider the conditional relationship established in statement 1.\n\nSince the bear is in the cave (statement 2), we can apply the conditional statement 1 to infer that the wolf is in the den. The condition \"the bear was in the cave\" is met, so the consequence \"the wolf was in the den\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
