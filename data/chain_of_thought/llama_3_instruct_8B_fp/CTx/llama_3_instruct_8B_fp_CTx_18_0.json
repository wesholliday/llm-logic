This statement implies that plooking and nugging are related in some way, possibly that they are the same thing or that one always follows the other. However, this statement does not provide any information about the reverse relationship, i.e., whether not being nugged implies not being plooked.\n\nThe statement only provides information about the relationship between plooking and nugging in one direction, not the other. Therefore, we cannot infer the reverse relationship, i.e., \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked\".\n\nAnswer: no",
