            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement, \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\". This means that if the sprocket was cranked, it is necessarily true that the sprocket was daggled. However, this does not mean that if the sprocket was not daggled, it was not cranked. There could be other reasons why the sprocket was not daggled, unrelated to whether it was cranked or not.\n\nFor example, the sprocket might have been daggled previously, but then had the daggling undone. Or, the sprocket might have been cranked, but the daggling process failed to occur. In these cases, the sprocket would not be daggled, but it would still have been cranked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the sprocket was not daggled, then it was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: no",
