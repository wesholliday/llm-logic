The statement is saying that if the splat was morphed, it necessarily leads to the splat quanking. This is a logical implication, not a probabilistic one.\n\nTo infer the converse statement \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed\", we would need to know that the quanking is a sufficient condition for the morphing. In other words, we would need to know that if the splat quanks, then it must have been morphed. However, the original statement only implies that if the splat was morphed, then it quanks, not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the converse statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
