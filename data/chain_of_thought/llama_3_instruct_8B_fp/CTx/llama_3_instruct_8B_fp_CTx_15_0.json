However, this does not necessarily mean that if the dreb was not spened, it was not vroombed. There could be other possibilities where the dreb was not spened but was still vroombed.\n\nFor example, there could be another condition that makes the dreb vroombed, but not spened. In this case, the original implication does not provide enough information to conclude that if the dreb was not spened, it was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: no",
