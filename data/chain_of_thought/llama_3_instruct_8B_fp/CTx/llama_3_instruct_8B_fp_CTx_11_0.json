This does not necessarily mean that the converse is true, i.e., that the truth of the consequent implies the truth of the antecedent.\n\nIn other words, just because the flug being blummed implies the flug being zimmed, it does not mean that the flug not being zimmed implies the flug not being blummed. There could be other reasons why the flug is not zimmed, unrelated to whether it was blummed or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
