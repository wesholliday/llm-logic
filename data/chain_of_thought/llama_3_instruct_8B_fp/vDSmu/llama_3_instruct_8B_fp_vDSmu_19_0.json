The second premise then eliminates one of those possibilities, leaving only the other option. The conclusion then follows logically from the remaining option.\n\nThe first premise \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist\" sets up a binary choice between two possibilities. The second premise \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist\" eliminates one of those possibilities, leaving only the option that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nThe conclusion \"The watch is charging on the dresser\" follows logically from the remaining option, as the only other possibility has been eliminated.\n\nAnswer: yes",
