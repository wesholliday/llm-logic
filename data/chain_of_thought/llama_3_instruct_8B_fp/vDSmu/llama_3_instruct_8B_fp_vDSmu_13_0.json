            "content": "Explanation: The argument is using a disjunction (either/or) as the first premise, which means it's saying that one of two possibilities is true. The second premise is a negation of one of the possibilities, which means it's saying that the other possibility is true. The conclusion is then stating that the remaining possibility is true.
