            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The application must have been completed online and it must have included references\" is a compound sentence with two independent clauses joined by \"and\". The first clause \"The application must have been completed online\" states a requirement for the application, and the second clause \"it must have included references\" also states a requirement. The word \"and\" is used to connect these two clauses, indicating that both conditions must be met.\n\nThe question is asking if we can infer the statement \"The application must have been completed online and included references\" from the original statement. The answer is yes, because the original statement already includes both conditions, and the word \"and\" explicitly indicates that both conditions must be met.\n\nAnswer: yes",
