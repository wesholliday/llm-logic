The conjunction \"and\" is used to connect these two clauses, indicating that both clauses are true. However, the sentence does not explicitly state that \"fizzle snork\" and \"blimp frazzle\" are the same thing. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The plimp must be fizzle snork and blimp frazzle\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
