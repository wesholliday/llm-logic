            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence states that the quorple \"must be at snork gribble and it must be in the wibble plonk\". The word \"and\" is used to connect two clauses, indicating that both conditions must be met. The first clause states that the quorple must be at snork gribble, and the second clause states that it must be in the wibble plonk. The use of \"and\" implies that both conditions are necessary and sufficient for the quorple to be in the desired state.\n\nAnswer: yes",
