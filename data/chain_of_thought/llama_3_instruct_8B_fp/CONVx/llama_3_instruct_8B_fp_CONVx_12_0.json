The statement implies that if the smip was shripped, then it is likely that the smip lupped the zoint. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the smip lupped the zoint, then it was shripped. The relationship between the two clauses is not bidirectional, and we cannot infer the converse statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
