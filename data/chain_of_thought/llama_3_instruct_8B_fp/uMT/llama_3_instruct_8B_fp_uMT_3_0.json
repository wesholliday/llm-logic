It implies that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. However, the second statement \"Also, the book is not a mystery novel\" contradicts the first statement, indicating that the book cannot be both written by James and be a mystery novel at the same time.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the book was not written by James, because if it was, it would have to be a mystery novel, but it's not. Therefore, the book cannot be written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
