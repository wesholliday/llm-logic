            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the consequence (Amy playing tennis) must also be true. However, the statement \"Amy did not play tennis\" contradicts the consequence of the conditional statement. This means that the condition \"Jeff played basketball\" cannot be true, because if it were, the consequence \"Amy played tennis\" would also be true, but we know that's not the case because Amy didn't play tennis.\n\nAnswer: yes",
