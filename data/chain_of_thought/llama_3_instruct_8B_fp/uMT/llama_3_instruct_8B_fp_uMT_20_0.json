However, the statement \"the banana was not yellow\" contradicts the consequent of the original conditional statement. This means that the antecedent (the apple being red) cannot be true, because if it were, the consequent (the banana being yellow) would also be true, but we know that's not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
