If the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry. However, the statement \"the muffins were not blueberry\" contradicts the initial implication. This means that the muffins cannot be blueberry, which was previously linked to the cake being chocolate.\n\nSince the muffins are not blueberry, we cannot conclude that the cake is not chocolate. The initial implication only stated that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry, but it did not state that if the muffins are not blueberry, then the cake is not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
