            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" implies that there is a relationship between the type of shirt and the type of pants. However, the second statement \"the pants were not denim\" contradicts the first statement, which means that the shirt cannot be cotton. This is because the first statement is saying that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim, but the second statement is saying that the pants are not denim. Therefore, we can conclude that the shirt cannot be cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
