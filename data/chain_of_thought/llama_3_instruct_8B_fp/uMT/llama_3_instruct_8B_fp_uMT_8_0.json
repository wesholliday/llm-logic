            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" and \"The mummy was not awake\". We can start by analyzing the first statement, which is a conditional statement. It implies that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake. This does not imply that if the mummy is not awake, the vampire is also not awake. The second statement tells us that the mummy is not awake, but it does not provide any information about the vampire's state.\n\nFrom the given information, we cannot directly conclude that the vampire was not awake. The mummy's state does not provide any information about the vampire's state. We can only say that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake, but we do not have any information about the vampire's state in this case.\n\nAnswer: no",
