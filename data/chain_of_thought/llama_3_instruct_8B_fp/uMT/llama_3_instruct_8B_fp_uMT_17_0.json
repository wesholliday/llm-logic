From the first statement, we can conclude that if Ben ate pasta, Kate would have eaten salad. However, the second statement tells us that Kate did not eat salad. This means that the condition \"Kate ate salad\" is not met. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Ben ate pasta, but we cannot directly infer that Ben did not eat pasta either.\n\nAnswer: no",
