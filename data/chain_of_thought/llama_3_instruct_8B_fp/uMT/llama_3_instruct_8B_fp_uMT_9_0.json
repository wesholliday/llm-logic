However, the statement \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" contradicts the previous statement, indicating that the correlation is not absolute.\n\nThe original statement does not provide any information about Lisa's purchase of the red shirt, only that it is related to Mark's purchase of the blue shirt. Since Mark did not buy the blue shirt, we cannot conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
