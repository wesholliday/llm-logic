            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Sue was not at the wedding\". From the first statement, we can conclude that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. However, the second statement tells us that Sue was not at the wedding. This creates a contradiction, as we cannot have both \"Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Sue was not at the wedding\" at the same time.\n\nSince the statements are contradictory, we cannot infer anything about Mary's presence at the wedding. We cannot conclude that Mary was or was not at the wedding based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
