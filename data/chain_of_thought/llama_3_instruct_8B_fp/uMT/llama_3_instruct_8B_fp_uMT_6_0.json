However, the statement \"Bob did not choose pasta\" contradicts the initial correlation. This means that the initial correlation is no longer valid.\n\nSince the correlation is broken, we cannot infer that Sue did not choose pizza. The original statement only established a connection between Sue's choice and Bob's choice, but it did not provide any information about Sue's choice independently.\n\nAnswer: no",
