Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can conclude that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. But statement 2 tells us that Jen did not watch basketball. This means that the condition in statement 1 (Jen watching basketball) is not met.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that Tom did not watch football. The condition in statement 1 is only that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. It does not say that if Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Tom did not watch football based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
