            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is a conditional statement that implies a relationship between the properties of the doll and the truck. It suggests that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. However, the statement \"the truck was not metal\" contradicts the implication made by the first statement. This means that the truck cannot be metal, which in turn means that the original conditional statement is false.\n\nSince the original conditional statement is false, we cannot infer that the doll is not plastic. The original statement only provided a relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal, but it did not provide any information about the doll's material if the truck is not metal.\n\nAnswer: no",
