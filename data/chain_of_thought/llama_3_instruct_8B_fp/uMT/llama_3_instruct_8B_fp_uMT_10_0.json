It does not say that the cat is always outside, only that it is outside when the dog is inside.\n2. \"The cat was not outside.\"\nThis statement tells us that the cat is not outside, which contradicts the first statement. This means that the dog cannot be inside, because if it were, the cat would be outside, but the cat is not outside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
