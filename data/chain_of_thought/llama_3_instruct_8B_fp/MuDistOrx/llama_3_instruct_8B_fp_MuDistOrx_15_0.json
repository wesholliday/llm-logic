The \"or\" in this sentence is an inclusive \"or\", which means that the speaker is suggesting that the frazzle must be in either flibbit or frozz, or possibly both. The sentence is not saying that the frazzle must be in one or the other, but rather that it must be in at least one of the two options.\n\nAnswer: yes",
