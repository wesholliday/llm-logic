            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"Sue was not at the wedding\" and \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\". We can use the second statement to create a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" can be rewritten as \"Sue was at the wedding\" is true if \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true.\n\nWe can then use the first statement \"Sue was not at the wedding\" to conclude that the condition \"Sue was at the wedding\" is false. Since the condition is false, we can infer that the antecedent \"Mary was at the wedding\" is also false. This means that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
