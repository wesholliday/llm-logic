We want to know if we can infer that \"The griffin was not in the forest\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the unicorn is not in the forest. From the second statement, we know that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is also in the forest. However, this does not give us any information about the griffin's presence in the forest when the unicorn is not in the forest.\n\nWe cannot conclude that the griffin is not in the forest because the second statement only talks about the relationship between the griffin and the unicorn's presence in the forest, but it does not provide any information about the griffin's presence when the unicorn is not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no",
