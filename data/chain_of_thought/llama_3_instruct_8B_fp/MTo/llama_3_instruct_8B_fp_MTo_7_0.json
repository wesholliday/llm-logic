We want to know if we can infer that \"Alex did not finish the race\".\n\nFrom the second statement, we can deduce that if Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished the race. However, this does not provide any information about what happens if Chris did not finish the race. The first statement tells us that Chris did not finish the race, but it does not provide any direct information about Alex's finish.\n\nWe cannot conclude that Alex did not finish the race because there is no direct connection between Chris's finish and Alex's finish. The statements only provide information about the relationship between Chris's finish and Alex's finish under the condition that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
