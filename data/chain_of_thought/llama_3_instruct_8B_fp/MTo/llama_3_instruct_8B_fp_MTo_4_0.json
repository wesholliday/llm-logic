We want to know if we can infer that \"The alien did not visit Mars\".\n\nFrom the second statement, we can deduce that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. However, this does not provide any information about the alien's visit to Mars if the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nThe first statement \"The robot did not visit Jupiter\" does not provide any direct information about the alien's visit to Mars. It only tells us that the robot did not visit Jupiter, but it does not give us any information about the alien's actions.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The alien did not visit Mars\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
