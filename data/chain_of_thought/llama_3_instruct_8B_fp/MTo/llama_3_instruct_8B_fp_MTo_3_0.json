We want to know if we can infer \"The book was not written by James\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the book is not a mystery novel. From the second statement, we know that if the book was written by James, then it would be a mystery novel. This implies that James only writes mystery novels.\n\nNow, we can combine this information. If the book is not a mystery novel (as stated in the first statement), then it cannot be written by James (since James only writes mystery novels). Therefore, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
