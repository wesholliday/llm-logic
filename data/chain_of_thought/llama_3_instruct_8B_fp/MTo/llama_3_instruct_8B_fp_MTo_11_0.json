We want to know if we can infer that \"The cake was not chocolate\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the muffins are not blueberry. From the second statement, we know that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry. This implies that if the cake is not chocolate, then the muffins are not blueberry.\n\nHowever, we only know that the muffins are not blueberry, not that they are not blueberry because the cake is not chocolate. There could be another reason why the muffins are not blueberry.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The cake was not chocolate\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
