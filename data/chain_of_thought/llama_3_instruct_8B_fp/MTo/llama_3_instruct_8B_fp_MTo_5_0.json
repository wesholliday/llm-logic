            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"Amy did not play tennis\" and \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\". We need to use these statements to infer whether Jeff played basketball or not. From the second statement, we can conclude that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. However, we are also given that Amy did not play tennis. This means that if Jeff played basketball, Amy would not have played tennis, which contradicts the second statement. Therefore, we can conclude that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
