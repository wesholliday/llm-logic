We want to know if we can infer \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. The second statement tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt. However, we know that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, so this implies that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
