We want to know if we can infer that \"Tom did not watch football\". To do this, we need to analyze the given statements and see if we can logically conclude that Tom did not watch football.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. But we are also given that Jen did not watch basketball. This means that if Tom watched football, Jen would not have watched basketball, which contradicts the second statement. Therefore, Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
