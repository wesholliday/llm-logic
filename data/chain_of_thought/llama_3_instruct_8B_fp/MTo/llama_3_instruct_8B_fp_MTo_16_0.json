            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"The pants were not denim\" and \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\". The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the shirt being cotton) is true, then the consequent (the pants being denim) must also be true. However, the first statement tells us that the pants were not denim, which contradicts the consequent of the second statement.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that the antecedent of the second statement (the shirt being cotton) must be false. This is because if the antecedent were true, the consequent (the pants being denim) would also be true, but we know that the pants were not denim. Therefore, the shirt cannot be cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
