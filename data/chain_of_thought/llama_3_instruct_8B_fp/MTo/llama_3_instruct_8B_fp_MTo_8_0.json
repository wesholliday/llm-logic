We want to know if we can infer that \"The vampire was not awake\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the mummy is not awake. From the second statement, we know that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake. However, this does not give us any information about the vampire's state when the mummy is not awake.\n\nWe cannot conclude that the vampire is not awake because there is no information about the vampire's state when the mummy is not awake. The statements only provide information about the mummy's state and the relationship between the mummy's and vampire's states when the vampire is awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
