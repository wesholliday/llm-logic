            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"The banana was not yellow\" and \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\". The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the apple being red) is true, then the consequent (the banana being yellow) must also be true. However, the first statement tells us that the banana is not yellow. This creates a contradiction with the second statement, which implies that the banana is yellow if the apple is red.\n\nSince the banana cannot be both yellow and not yellow at the same time, we can conclude that the antecedent of the second statement (the apple being red) must be false. This means that the apple is not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
