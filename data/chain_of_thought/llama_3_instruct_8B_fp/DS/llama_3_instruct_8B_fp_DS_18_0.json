            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand\" and \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand\". The first statement is a disjunction, which means it is saying that one of the two options is true. The second statement is a negation, which means it is saying that the second option is false.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand. This means that the first option, \"The notebook is in the drawer\", must be true. This is because the first statement is saying that either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand, and we have already eliminated the second option.\n\nAnswer: yes",
