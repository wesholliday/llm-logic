            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch\" and \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch\". The first statement is a disjunction, which means it is saying that one of the two options is true. The second statement is a negation, which means it is saying that the second option is false.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the remote control is not hiding under the couch. This means that the only option left is that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is indeed on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
