            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden\" and \"Fido is not in the garden\". The first statement is a disjunction, which means it is true if at least one of the two options is true. The second statement is a negation, which means it is true if the opposite of the statement is true.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that Fido is not in the garden. This means that the first option in the disjunction, \"Fido is in the garden\", is false.\n\nSince the first option is false, the only remaining option is \"Fido is inside\". Therefore, we can infer that Fido is indeed inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
