We can start by analyzing the second statement, which is a disjunction (either/or) statement. This means that one of the two options must be true. If the sprocket is not daggled, then the first option \"the sprocket is cranked\" must be true, since the second option \"it is daggled\" is already ruled out.\n\nAnswer: yes",
