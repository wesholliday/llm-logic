We can start by analyzing the second statement, which is a disjunction (a statement that says something is either true or true). This means that at least one of the two options must be true. If the zinger is not smoogled, then the first option \"the zinger is fraggled\" must be true, because the second option \"it is smoogled\" is already ruled out.\n\nAnswer: yes",
