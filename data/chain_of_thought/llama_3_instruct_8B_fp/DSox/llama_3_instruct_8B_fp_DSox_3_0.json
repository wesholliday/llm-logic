We can start by analyzing the second statement, which is a disjunction (a statement that says something is either A or B). This means that one of the two options must be true. If the splat is not quanked, then the first option \"the splat is morphed\" must be true, since the second option \"it is quanked\" is already ruled out.\n\nAnswer: yes",
