We can start by analyzing the second statement, which is a disjunction (either/or) statement. This means that one of the two options must be true. If the sneg is not sproted, then the first option \"the sneg is crampled\" must be true, since the second option \"it is sproted\" is already ruled out.\n\nAnswer: yes",
