From the first statement, we know that the wug is not garpled. From the second statement, we know that either the wug is sproinged or it is garpled. Since we know that the wug is not garpled, we can conclude that it must be sproinged. This is because the only other option is that it is garpled, but we know that's not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
