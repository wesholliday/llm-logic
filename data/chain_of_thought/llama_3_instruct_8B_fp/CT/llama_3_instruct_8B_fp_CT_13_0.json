            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement, which means that it implies a relationship between the car's color and the truck's color. The statement is saying that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. However, this does not mean that if the truck is not blue, then the car must not be red.\n\nThe original statement does not provide any information about what happens when the truck is not blue. It only talks about the relationship between the car's color and the truck's color when the car is red. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the truck is not blue, then the car is not red.\n\nAnswer: no",
