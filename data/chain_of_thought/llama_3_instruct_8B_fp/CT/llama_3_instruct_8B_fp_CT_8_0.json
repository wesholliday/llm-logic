            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is a conditional statement, which means that it implies a relationship between the two conditions. The \"if\" clause is the antecedent, and the \"then\" clause is the consequent. The statement is saying that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake. This implies that the mummy's wakefulness is dependent on the vampire's wakefulness.\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake\", we would need to assume that the mummy's wakefulness is the only possible state that can occur independently of the vampire's wakefulness. However, the original statement does not provide any information about the mummy's wakefulness when the vampire is not awake. It only tells us that if the vampire is awake, the mummy is also awake, but it does not provide any information about the mummy's state when the vampire is not awake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
