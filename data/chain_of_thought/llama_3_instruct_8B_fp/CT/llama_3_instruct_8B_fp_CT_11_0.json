This means that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. However, this does not imply that if the muffins are not blueberry, then the cake is not chocolate.\n\nThe original statement only provides a relationship between the cake being chocolate and the muffins being blueberry, but it does not provide any information about the relationship between the muffins not being blueberry and the cake not being chocolate. In other words, the original statement does not provide a sufficient basis to make an inference about the cake's flavor based on the muffins' flavor.\n\nAnswer: no",
