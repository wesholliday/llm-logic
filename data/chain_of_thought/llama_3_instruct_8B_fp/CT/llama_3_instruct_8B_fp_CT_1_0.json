            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement, which means that it implies a relationship between the two statements. Specifically, it implies that if Mary is at the wedding, then Sue must also be at the wedding. This is a logical implication, as the statement is saying that Mary's presence at the wedding is a sufficient condition for Sue's presence.\n\nHowever, the converse implication \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\" is not necessarily true. It's possible that Mary was at the wedding, but Sue was not, which would contradict this implication.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the converse implication from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
