This means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, it is necessarily true that Mark bought the blue shirt. However, this does not mean that if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt. The original statement only provides information about the relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt, but it does not provide information about the relationship between Mark not buying the blue shirt and Lisa not buying the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
