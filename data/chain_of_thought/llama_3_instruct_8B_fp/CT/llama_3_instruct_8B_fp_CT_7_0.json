This does not necessarily mean that if the consequent is false (Chris did not finish the race), then the antecedent must also be false (Alex did not finish the race).\n\nIn other words, the original statement only provides information about the relationship between Alex and Chris when both of them finish the race. It does not provide any information about what happens when Chris does not finish the race.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
