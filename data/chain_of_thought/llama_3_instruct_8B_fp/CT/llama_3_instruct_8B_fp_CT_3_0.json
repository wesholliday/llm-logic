            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement, \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\". This implies that there is a relationship between the two clauses, where if the book was written by James, it must be a mystery novel. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the book is not a mystery novel, it was not written by James.\n\nIn other words, the original statement only provides information about the relationship between James and mystery novels, but does not provide any information about the relationship between James and non-mystery novels. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the book is not a mystery novel, it was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: no",
