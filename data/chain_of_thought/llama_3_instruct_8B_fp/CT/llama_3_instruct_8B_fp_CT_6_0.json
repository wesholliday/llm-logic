Specifically, it says that if Sue chooses pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. This does not necessarily mean that if Bob does not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza. There could be other possibilities, such as Bob choosing something else entirely, or Sue choosing pizza and Bob choosing pasta anyway.\n\nAnswer: no",
