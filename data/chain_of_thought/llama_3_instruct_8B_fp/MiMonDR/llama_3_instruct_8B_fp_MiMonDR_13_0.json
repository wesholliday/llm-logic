This uncertainty can be extended to include the possibility that the meeting might be scheduled, as the opposite of being cancelled is being scheduled. The sentence does not explicitly state that the meeting might be scheduled, but the context of uncertainty and possibility allows us to infer that it might be scheduled as well.\n\nAnswer: yes",
