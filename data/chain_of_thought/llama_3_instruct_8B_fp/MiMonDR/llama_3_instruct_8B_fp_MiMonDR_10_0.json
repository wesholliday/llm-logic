            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The computer might be broken\" implies that there is a possibility that the computer is not functioning properly or is non-functional. The word \"might\" indicates a degree of uncertainty or possibility. To infer \"The computer might be working or broken\" would mean that the computer could be in one of two states: either it is working or it is broken. This inference is reasonable because the original statement already implies that the computer's state is uncertain, and the two states mentioned (working or broken) cover all possible outcomes.\n\nAnswer: yes",
