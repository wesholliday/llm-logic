            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The train might be late\" implies that there is a possibility that the train will arrive late, but it does not explicitly rule out the possibility that the train might arrive on time. The word \"might\" is a modal verb that indicates possibility, and it does not provide any information about the other possible outcomes. Therefore, we can infer that the train might be on time or late, as the statement does not exclude the possibility of the train arriving on time.\n\nAnswer: yes",
