The second statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" is a negation, which means it's saying that the opposite of the first statement is true.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden. But the second statement tells us that Fido is not necessarily in the garden. This means that the only remaining option is that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
