The second statement \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" is a negation, which means that the opposite of the statement is true. Since the cookies cannot be both in the jar and hidden in the pantry at the same time, we can conclude that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
