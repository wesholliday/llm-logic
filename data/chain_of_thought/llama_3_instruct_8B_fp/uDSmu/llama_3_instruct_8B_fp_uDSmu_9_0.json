The second statement \"Also, it's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor\" adds a new piece of information, which is that the piece not necessarily being on the floor. This doesn't provide any new information about the piece being in the box. The original statement still presents two possibilities, and the second statement doesn't rule out the possibility that the piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
