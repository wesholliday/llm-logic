The second statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" is a negation, which means it's saying that the opposite of the first option is true.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf. However, we can't directly infer that the toy is in the toy box. The disjunction only provides two options, but it doesn't give us any information about which one is actually true.\n\nAnswer: no",
