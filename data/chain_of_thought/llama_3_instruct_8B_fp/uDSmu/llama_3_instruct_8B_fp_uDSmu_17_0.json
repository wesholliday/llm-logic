            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack\" presents two mutually exclusive options. This means that if the scarf is not stuffed in the backpack, it must be draped on the coat rack, and vice versa. The second statement \"it's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack\" implies that the scarf is not draped on the coat rack. Since the scarf is not draped on the coat rack, we can conclude that it must be stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
