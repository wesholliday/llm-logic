            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" presents two mutually exclusive options. This means that if the sunglasses are not in her bag, they must be perched on her head, and vice versa. The second statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" implies that the sunglasses are not perched on her head.
