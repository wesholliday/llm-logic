The second statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" is a negation, which means it's saying that the second option is not true.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that the first option \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" must be true. This is because the first statement is saying that either the remote control is on the coffee table or it's hiding under the couch, and the second statement is saying that it's not hiding under the couch. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
