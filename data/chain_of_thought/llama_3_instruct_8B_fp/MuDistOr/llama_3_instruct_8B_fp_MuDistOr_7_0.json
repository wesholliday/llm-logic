The word \"or\" is used to indicate that one of the two options must be true, but not necessarily both. The statement is saying that the flight's status is either delayed or cancelled, but it's not saying that it's both.\n\nIn this case, we can infer that the flight must have been either delayed or cancelled, but not necessarily both. The original statement is not implying that the flight must have been both delayed and cancelled, but rather that one of the two options must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
