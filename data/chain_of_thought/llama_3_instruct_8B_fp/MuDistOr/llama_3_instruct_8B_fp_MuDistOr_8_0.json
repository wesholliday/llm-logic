            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The document must have been signed or notarized\" is a disjunction, which means it is stating that one or both of the conditions must be true. However, the inference \"The document must have been signed or it must have been notarized\" is a conjunction, which means it is stating that one or the other of the conditions must be true. The original statement does not imply that the document must have been signed or notarized exclusively, but rather that it must have been signed or notarized in some way. Therefore, we cannot infer that the document must have been signed or it must have been notarized.\n\nAnswer: no",
