            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence \"The keys must have been in the drawer or on the hook\" is a compound sentence with a coordinating conjunction \"or\". The \"or\" implies that the two clauses \"in the drawer\" and \"on the hook\" are mutually exclusive, meaning that the keys cannot be in both places at the same time. Therefore, we can infer that the keys must have been in either the drawer or on the hook, but not both.\n\nAnswer: yes",
