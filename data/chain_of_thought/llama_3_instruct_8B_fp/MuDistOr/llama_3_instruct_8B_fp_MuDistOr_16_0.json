            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence is a compound sentence, where \"or\" is used to connect two clauses. The word \"or\" is used to indicate that one of the two options must be true, but not necessarily both. In this case, the sentence is saying that the contract must have been approved by either the legal team or the CEO, implying that it's possible for it to be approved by one or the other, but not necessarily both.\n\nThe inference being asked is whether the original sentence implies that the contract must have been approved by one of the two options, but not necessarily both. The answer is yes, the original sentence does imply this. The use of \"or\" in the sentence suggests that the contract must have been approved by one of the two options, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it was approved by both.\n\nAnswer: yes",
