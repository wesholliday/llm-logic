            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the tizzer is on, then the goom is snurpled\" is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition \"the tizzer is on\" is true, then the consequence \"the goom is snurpled\" must also be true. However, this statement does not provide any information about the plink light. It only talks about the relationship between the tizzer and the goom.\n\nTo infer the new statement \"If the tizzer is on and the plink light is out, then the goom is snurpled\", we would need additional information that links the plink light to the goom. The original statement does not provide this information, so we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
