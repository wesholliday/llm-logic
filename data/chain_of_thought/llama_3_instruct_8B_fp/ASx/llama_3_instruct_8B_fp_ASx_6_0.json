However, the statement does not provide any information about the presence or absence of \"plorks\" or any other factors that might affect the outcome.\n\nThe added condition \"and I am wearing plorks\" introduces a new variable that is not present in the original statement. Without any additional information or evidence, we cannot infer that the presence of \"plorks\" would affect the outcome of \"glurping\" on \"my snarfs\". The original statement only provides a general relationship between \"glurping\" and \"hurting my snarfs\", and does not provide any specific information about the role of \"plorks\" in this relationship.\n\nAnswer: no",
