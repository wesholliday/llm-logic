The second clause provides additional information about the exam, but it does not directly support the conclusion that the exam was difficult. The sentence does not provide any explicit evidence or logical connection between the exam being difficult and covering all chapters. Therefore, we cannot infer that the exam must have been difficult solely based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
