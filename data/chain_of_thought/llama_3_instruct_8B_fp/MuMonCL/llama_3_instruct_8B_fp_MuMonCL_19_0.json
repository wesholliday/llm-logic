            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a compound sentence, which means it contains two independent clauses joined by a conjunction. The first clause is \"The application must have been completed online\" and the second clause is \"included references\". The conjunction \"and\" is used to join these two clauses. The second clause provides additional information about the first clause, but it does not modify the meaning of the first clause. Therefore, we can infer the first clause, \"The application must have been completed online\", from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
