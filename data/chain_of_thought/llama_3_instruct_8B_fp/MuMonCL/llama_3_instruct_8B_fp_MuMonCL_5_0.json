            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for\" implies that the package was delivered today, but it also adds an additional condition that it was signed for. The \"and\" in the statement suggests that both conditions must be true. However, the second condition \"signed for\" does not necessarily imply that the package was delivered today. It's possible that the package was delivered earlier and signed for today. Therefore, we cannot infer that the package must have been delivered today solely based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
