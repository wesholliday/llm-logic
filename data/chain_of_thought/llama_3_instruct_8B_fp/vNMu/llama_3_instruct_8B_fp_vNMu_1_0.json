            "content": "Explanation: The argument is attempting to establish a possibility (Mary might not have been at the wedding) based on the negation of a necessity (It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding). The key question is whether the negation of a necessity implies a possibility.\n\nIn this case, the argument is logically valid because the negation of a necessity does indeed imply a possibility. If it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding, then it's possible that Mary was not at the wedding. This is because the negation of a necessity (Mary must have been at the wedding) implies that Mary's presence at the wedding is not guaranteed, which in turn implies that Mary's absence at the wedding is possible.\n\nAnswer: yes",
