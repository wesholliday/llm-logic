It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered. This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the options must be true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that it's not the case that the fleeg must be surned. This means that the first option in the disjunction (the fleeg must be surned) is false.\n\nSince the first option is false, the second option (the fleeg is bluttered) must be true. This is because the disjunction is exhaustive, meaning that one of the options must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
