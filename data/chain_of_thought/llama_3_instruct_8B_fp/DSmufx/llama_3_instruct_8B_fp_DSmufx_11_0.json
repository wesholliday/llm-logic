It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed. This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the options must be true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that it's not the case that the flug must be zimmed. This means that the first option in the disjunction (the flug must be zimmed) is false.\n\nSince the first option is false, the second option (the flug is blummed) must be true. Therefore, we can infer that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
