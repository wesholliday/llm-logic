It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked. This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the options must be true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that it's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked. This implies that the whiffle is not tinked.\n\nNow, we can combine the information from both statements. Since the whiffle is not tinked, and it must be tinked or shanked, it must be shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
