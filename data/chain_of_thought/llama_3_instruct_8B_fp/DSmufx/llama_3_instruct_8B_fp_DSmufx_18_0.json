It's not the case that the shank must be nugged.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the shank must be either nugged or plooked. From statement 2, we know that the shank cannot be nugged (since it's not the case that it must be nugged).\n\nSince the shank cannot be nugged, it must be plooked. This is because statement 1 says that the shank must be either nugged or plooked, and we've already ruled out the possibility of it being nugged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
