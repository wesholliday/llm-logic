The if-then statement is saying that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. This implies that the two choices are related in some way, but it does not necessarily mean that they are mutually exclusive. The second statement, \"Bob chose pasta\", confirms the then part of the if-then statement, but it does not provide any information about Sue's choice. Therefore, we cannot infer Sue's choice based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
