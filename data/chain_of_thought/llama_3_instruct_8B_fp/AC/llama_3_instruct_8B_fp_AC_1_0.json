Sue was at the wedding\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. This is a conditional statement, and the condition is \"Mary was at the wedding\". The conclusion is \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n\nStatement 2 tells us that Sue was indeed at the wedding. However, this statement does not provide any information about Mary's presence at the wedding.\n\nTo infer that Mary was at the wedding, we would need to know that the condition in statement 1 is true, i.e., we would need to know that Mary was at the wedding. But statement 2 only tells us that Sue was at the wedding, not that Mary was.\n\nAnswer: no",
