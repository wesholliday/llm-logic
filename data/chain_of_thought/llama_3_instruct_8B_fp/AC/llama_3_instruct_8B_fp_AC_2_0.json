The unicorn was in the forest\n\nWe are trying to infer the truth of the statement \"The griffin was in the forest\". To do this, we need to use the first statement, which is an if-then statement. This statement says that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is also in the forest.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the unicorn is indeed in the forest. But this does not directly tell us whether the griffin is in the forest or not. The if-then statement only gives us a conditional relationship between the griffin and the unicorn, but it does not provide a direct conclusion about the griffin's presence in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the truth of the statement \"The griffin was in the forest\" solely based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
