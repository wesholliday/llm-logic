Jen watched basketball\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequence (Jen watched basketball) must also be true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Jen did indeed watch basketball. However, this does not provide any direct information about Tom's actions. The statement only tells us about Jen's actions, not Tom's.\n\nSince we don't have any additional information about Tom's actions, we cannot directly infer that Tom watched football. The conditional statement only provides a relationship between Tom's actions and Jen's actions, but it does not provide a direct link between Tom's actions and the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
