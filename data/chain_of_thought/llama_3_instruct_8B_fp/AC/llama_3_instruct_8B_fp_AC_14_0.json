The wolf was in the den.\n\nWe are trying to infer whether the bear was in the cave or not. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means it only implies the conclusion if the antecedent (the bear being in the cave) is true. The second statement is a categorical statement, which simply states that the wolf was in the den.\n\nTo infer the conclusion, we need to use the first statement. If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. But we don't know if the bear was in the cave or not. We only know that the wolf was in the den. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that the bear was in the cave.\n\nAnswer: no",
