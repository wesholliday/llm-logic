The conditional statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" implies that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. The categorical statement \"The muffins were blueberry\" tells us that the muffins are indeed blueberry. However, this does not necessarily mean that the cake is chocolate. The conditional statement only provides a relationship between the cake being chocolate and the muffins being blueberry, but it does not provide a direct relationship between the muffins being blueberry and the cake being chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
