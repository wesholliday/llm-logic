            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\" and \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball\". The first statement implies that if Tom watched football, then Jen would have watched basketball. The second statement negates this implication, stating that Jen did not have to watch basketball. This means that Tom did not watch football, because if he did, Jen would have had to watch basketball, but she didn't.\n\nAnswer: yes",
