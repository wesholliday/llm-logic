            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake\" and \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake\". The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the vampire was awake) is true, then the consequent (the mummy must have been awake) must also be true. The second statement is a negation of the consequent, which means that the mummy must not have been awake.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the vampire was not awake. If the mummy must not have been awake, then the vampire must not have been awake either, since if the vampire was awake, the mummy would have been awake as well. Therefore, the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
