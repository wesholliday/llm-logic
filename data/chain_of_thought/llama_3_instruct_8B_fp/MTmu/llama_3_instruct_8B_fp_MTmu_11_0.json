            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are:\n\n1. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\n2. It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry. This is a conditional statement, and the antecedent is \"the cake was chocolate\". The consequent is \"the muffins must have been blueberry\".\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry. This is a negation of the consequent in statement 1.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry (from statement 1). But it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry (from statement 2). This means that the cake cannot have been chocolate, because if it was, the muffins would have been blueberry, but they're not.\n\nAnswer: yes",
