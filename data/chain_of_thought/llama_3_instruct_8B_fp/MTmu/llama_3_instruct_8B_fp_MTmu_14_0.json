It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. This is a conditional statement, and the antecedent is \"the bear was in the cave\". The consequent is \"the wolf must have been in the den\".\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that it's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den. This is a negation of the consequent in statement 1.\n\nNow, we can use the principle of contrapositive to infer that if the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave. This is because if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den (by statement 1), and if the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave (by contrapositive).\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer that the bear was not in the cave from the given statements. We can only infer that if the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: no",
