            "content": "Explanation: The given argument is a conditional statement, \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\". This statement implies that if the apple is red, then the banana has a specific property (being yellow). However, the second statement \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow\" is a negation of the conclusion of the first statement. This negation does not directly affect the antecedent (the apple being red) of the first statement.\n\nThe negation only tells us that the banana not having the property of being yellow is possible, but it does not provide any information about the apple being red or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that the apple was not red from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
