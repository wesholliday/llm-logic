            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are:\n\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n2. It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This is a conditional statement, and the antecedent is \"Joe went to the park\". The consequent is \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo\".\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that it's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This is a negation of the consequent in statement 1.\n\nNow, we want to infer whether Joe did not go to the park. To do this, we need to negate the antecedent of statement 1, which is \"Joe went to the park\". If we negate this, we get \"Joe did not go to the park\".\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer \"Joe did not go to the park\" from the given statements. The reason is that the negation of the consequent in statement 2 does not necessarily imply the negation of the antecedent in statement 1.\n\nFor example, it's possible that Joe went to the park, but Lucy did not go to the zoo. In this case, the antecedent of statement 1 is true, but the consequent is false. This would mean that the negation of the consequent in statement 2 is true, but the negation of the antecedent in statement 1 is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"Joe did not go to the park\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
