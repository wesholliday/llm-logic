            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\" and \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel\". The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the book was written by James) is true, then the consequent (the book must be a mystery novel) must also be true. The second statement is a negation of the consequent, which means that the book must not be a mystery novel.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that the book was not written by James. This is because if the book was written by James, then it would have to be a mystery novel, but we know that it's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel. Therefore, the book cannot have been written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
