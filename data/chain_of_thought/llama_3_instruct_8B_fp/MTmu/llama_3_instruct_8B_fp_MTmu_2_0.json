            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest\" and \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest\". The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the griffin being in the forest) is true, then the consequent (the unicorn being in the forest) must also be true. The second statement is a negation of the consequent, which means that the unicorn not being in the forest is true.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest. This is because if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn would also have to be in the forest, but we know that the unicorn is not in the forest. Therefore, the griffin cannot be in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
