            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" and \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding\". The first statement implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue's presence at the wedding is a necessary condition. The second statement negates this necessary condition, implying that Sue's presence at the wedding is not a necessary condition. This means that Sue's presence at the wedding is not guaranteed, even if Mary was at the wedding.\n\nFrom this, we cannot directly infer that Mary was not at the wedding. The original statement only talks about the relationship between Mary and Sue's presence at the wedding, not about Mary's presence itself. We don't have any information about Mary's presence or absence.\n\nAnswer: no",
