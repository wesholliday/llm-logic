            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are:\n\n1. If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\n2. It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. This is a conditional statement, and the antecedent is \"the car was red\". The consequent is \"the truck must have been blue\".\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that it's not the case that the truck must have been blue. This is a negation of the consequent in statement 1.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue (by statement 1). But it's not the case that the truck must have been blue (by statement 2). This means that the car cannot have been red, because if it was, the truck would have been blue, but it's not.\n\nAnswer: yes",
