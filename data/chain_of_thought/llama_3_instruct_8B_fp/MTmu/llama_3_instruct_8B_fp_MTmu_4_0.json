It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter. \n\nFrom statement 2, we can infer that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nNow, combining these two inferences, we can conclude that if the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter. \n\nHowever, we cannot directly conclude that the alien did not visit Mars. We can only conclude that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter, but we don't know whether the alien visited Mars or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
