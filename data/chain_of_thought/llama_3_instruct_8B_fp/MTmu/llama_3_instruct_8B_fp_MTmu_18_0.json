            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" and \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\". The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the doll being plastic) is true, then the consequent (the truck being metal) must also be true. The second statement is a negation of the consequent, which means that the truck is not necessarily metal.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that the antecedent (the doll being plastic) is not necessarily true. This is because if the antecedent were true, then the consequent (the truck being metal) would also be true, but we know that the consequent is not necessarily true. Therefore, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: no",
