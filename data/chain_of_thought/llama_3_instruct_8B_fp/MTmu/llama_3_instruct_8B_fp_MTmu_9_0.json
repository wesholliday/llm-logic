            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" and \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\". The first statement implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. The second statement negates this implication, stating that it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This means that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nFrom this, we cannot directly infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. The original statement only implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt, but it does not say anything about what happens if Lisa did not buy the red shirt. The second statement only tells us that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, but it does not provide any information about Lisa's purchase.\n\nAnswer: no",
