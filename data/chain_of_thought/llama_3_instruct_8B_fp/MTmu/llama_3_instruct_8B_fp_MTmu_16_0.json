            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\" and \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim\". The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the shirt being cotton) is true, then the consequent (the pants being denim) must also be true. The second statement is a negation of the consequent, which means that the pants cannot be denim.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that the antecedent (the shirt being cotton) cannot be true. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants would have to be denim, but we know that's not the case. Therefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
