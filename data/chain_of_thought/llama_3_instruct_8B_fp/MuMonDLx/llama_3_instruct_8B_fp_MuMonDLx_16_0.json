It does not provide any information about other possible states of \"the frazzle\". The addition of \"or flibbit floob\" would require additional information or context to make a logical connection between the two states. Without any additional information, we cannot infer that \"The frazzle must be crunk zump or flibbit floob\" because the original statement only provides information about one possible state.\n\nAnswer: no",
