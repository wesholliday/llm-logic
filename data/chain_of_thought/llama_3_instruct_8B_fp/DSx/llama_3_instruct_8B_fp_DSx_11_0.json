From the second statement, we know that the flug is not zimmed. Now, let's analyze the first statement. It says \"Either the flug is blummed or it is zimmed\". Since we know that the flug is not zimmed (from the second statement), we can conclude that the flug must be blummed. This is because the first statement is saying that either blummed or zimmed is true, and we've already ruled out zimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
