The shank is not nugged.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the shank is either plooked or nugged. From statement 2, we know that the shank is not nugged. This means that the shank cannot be nugged, as it is explicitly stated that it is not.\n\nNow, we can use the principle of excluded middle, which states that a statement is either true or false. Since the shank is not nugged, it must be plooked. This is because the only other option, that the shank is nugged, has been ruled out.\n\nAnswer: yes",
