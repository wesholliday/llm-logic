The first statement is a disjunction, which means it is saying that one of the two options is true. The second statement is a negation, which means it is saying that the opposite of the second option is true.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the whiffle is not tinked. This means that the first option, \"the whiffle is shanked\", must be true. This is because the first statement is saying that either the whiffle is shanked or it is tinked, and we have already eliminated the second option.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
