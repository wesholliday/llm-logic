We need to determine if we can infer that \"The splat is morphed\" from these statements.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the splat is either morphed or quanked. From the second statement, we know that the splat is not quanked. Therefore, we can conclude that the splat must be morphed, since it cannot be quanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
