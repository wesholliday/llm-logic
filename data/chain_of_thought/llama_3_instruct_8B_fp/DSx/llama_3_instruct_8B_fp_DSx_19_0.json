The first statement is a disjunction, which means it is saying that one of the two options is true. The second statement is a negation, which means it is saying that the opposite of the second option is true.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the smonk is not plagged. This means that the first option in the disjunction, \"the smonk is vreebled\", must be true. This is because the disjunction is saying that either the smonk is vreebled or it is plagged, and we have already eliminated the possibility that it is plagged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
