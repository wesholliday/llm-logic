We need to determine if we can infer \"The smip is shripped\" from these statements.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the smip is either shripped or lupped. The second statement tells us that the smip is not lupped. Therefore, we can conclude that the smip must be shripped, since it cannot be lupped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
