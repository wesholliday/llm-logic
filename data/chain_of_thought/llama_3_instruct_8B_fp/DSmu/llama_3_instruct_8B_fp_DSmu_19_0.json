It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the watch is either charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist. Statement 2 tells us that it's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist. This means that the watch cannot be on his wrist.\n\nNow, we are left with only one option from statement 1, which is that the watch is charging on the dresser. Since the watch cannot be on his wrist, it must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
