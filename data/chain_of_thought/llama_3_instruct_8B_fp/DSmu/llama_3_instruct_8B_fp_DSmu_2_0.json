It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the book is either on the shelf or it must be resting on the table. From statement 2, we know that it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table. This implies that the book cannot be resting on the table.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n* If the book is on the shelf, then it satisfies the condition in statement 1.\n* If the book is not on the shelf, then it must be resting on the table, which is not the case according to statement 2.\n\nSince the book cannot be resting on the table, it must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
