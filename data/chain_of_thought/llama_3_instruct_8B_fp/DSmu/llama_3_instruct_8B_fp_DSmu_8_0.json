It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the remote control is either on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch. This is an exhaustive list of possibilities, meaning that one of these two options must be true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that it's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch. This implies that the remote control is not hiding under the couch.\n\nNow, we can combine these two pieces of information. Since the remote control is not hiding under the couch, and it's either on the coffee table or hiding under the couch, we can conclude that the remote control must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
