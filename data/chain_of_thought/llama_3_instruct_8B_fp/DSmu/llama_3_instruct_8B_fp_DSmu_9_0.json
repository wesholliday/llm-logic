It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are only two possibilities: the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor. Statement 2 tells us that the second possibility (it must be blending in on the floor) is not the case.\n\nSince the second possibility is ruled out, we can conclude that the first possibility must be true, which is that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
