It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the pen is either in my bag or it must be on my desk. Statement 2 tells us that it's not the case that the pen must be on my desk. This means that the pen cannot be on my desk.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If the pen is in my bag, then it's indeed in my bag, and we can conclude that the pen is in my bag.\n* If the pen is not in my bag, then it must be on my desk (from statement 1). But we know that it's not the case that the pen must be on my desk (from statement 2), which is a contradiction.\n\nSince we've ruled out the possibility that the pen is not in my bag, we can conclude that the pen is indeed in my bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
