            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" presents a disjunction, which means that one of the two options must be true. The second statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" negates one of the options. Since the second statement explicitly denies the possibility of the sunglasses being perched on her head, we can conclude that the first option, \"the sunglasses are in her bag\", must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
