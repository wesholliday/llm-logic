It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the missing sock is either in the laundry basket or under the bed. From statement 2, we know that it's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed. This implies that the missing sock is not under the bed.\n\nNow, we can use the principle of excluded middle, which states that a statement is either true or false. Since the missing sock is not under the bed, it must be in the laundry basket. This is because statement 1 says that the missing sock is either in the laundry basket or under the bed, and we've already ruled out the possibility of it being under the bed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
