            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical inference, specifically a modus ponens argument. The given statements are:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (Hypothesis)\n2. The book is a mystery novel (Conclusion)\n\nWe need to determine if it follows that the book was written by James. To do this, we can apply the modus ponens rule, which states that if P implies Q, and Q is true, then P must also be true.\n\nIn this case, P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel\". Since the hypothesis states that if P is true, then Q is true, and we know that Q is true (the book is a mystery novel), we can conclude that P must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
