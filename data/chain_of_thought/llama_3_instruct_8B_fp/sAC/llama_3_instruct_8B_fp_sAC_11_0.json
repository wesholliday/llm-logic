It means that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. This does not necessarily mean that if the muffins are blueberry, then the cake must be chocolate. The conditional statement only provides a relationship between the cake being chocolate and the muffins being blueberry, but it does not provide a direct relationship between the muffins being blueberry and the cake being chocolate.\n\nHowever, we are given another statement \"The muffins were blueberry\" which is true. This means that the muffins being blueberry is a fact. Now, we can use the original conditional statement to infer that if the muffins are blueberry, then the cake must be chocolate. This is because the original statement says that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry, and we know that the muffins are blueberry.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the cake is indeed chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
