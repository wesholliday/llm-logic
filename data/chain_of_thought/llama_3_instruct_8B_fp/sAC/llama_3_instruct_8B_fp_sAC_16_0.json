            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement, which means that it implies a relationship between the shirt and the pants. The statement is saying that if the shirt is made of cotton, then the pants must be made of denim. This is a logical implication, not a direct statement about the shirt.\n\nThe second statement \"The pants were denim\" is a factual statement that confirms one part of the conditional statement.\n\nTo determine if the shirt was cotton, we need to go back to the original conditional statement and see if the pants being denim implies that the shirt was cotton. The answer is yes, it does. If the pants were denim, then it is logical to conclude that the shirt was cotton, since the conditional statement implies that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim.\n\nAnswer: yes",
