The \"if\" clause is the antecedent, and the \"then\" clause is the consequent. The statement is saying that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we are given that the consequent \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is true. This means that the conditional statement is satisfied, and we can conclude that the antecedent \"Joe went to the park\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
