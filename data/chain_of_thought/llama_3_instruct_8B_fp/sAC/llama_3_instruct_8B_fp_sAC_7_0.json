The second statement \"Chris finished the race\" is a categorical statement that asserts the truth of the consequent.\n\nSince the consequent is true, we can infer that the antecedent must also be true. This is because the conditional statement guarantees that if the antecedent is true, the consequent must also be true. Therefore, we can conclude that \"Alex finished the race\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
