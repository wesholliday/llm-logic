However, this does not mean that the condition is the only possible cause of the consequence. There could be other conditions that also lead to the consequence.\n\nIn this case, we are given that the truck was metal, which means that the consequence is true. But we cannot conclude that the condition (the doll being plastic) is true. There could be other reasons why the truck was metal, and we don't have enough information to determine whether the doll was plastic or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
