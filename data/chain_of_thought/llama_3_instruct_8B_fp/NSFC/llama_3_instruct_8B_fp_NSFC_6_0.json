            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package might arrive on Monday or Tuesday\" is a disjunctive statement, which means it presents two mutually exclusive options. The word \"or\" is used to indicate that the package will arrive on either Monday or Tuesday, but not both. This implies that the package will arrive on one of the two days, but not necessarily both.\n\nIn this case, we cannot infer that the package might arrive on both Monday and Tuesday. The original statement only provides two options, and it does not suggest that the package might arrive on both days.\n\nAnswer: no",
