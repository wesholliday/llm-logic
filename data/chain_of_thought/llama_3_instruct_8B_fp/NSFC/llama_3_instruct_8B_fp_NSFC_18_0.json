            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The project might be completed early or late\" is a disjunction, which means it presents two mutually exclusive possibilities. The word \"or\" is used to indicate that one of the two options must be true, but not both. This implies that the project cannot be completed both early and late at the same time. Therefore, we cannot infer that the project might be completed both early and late.\n\nAnswer: no",
