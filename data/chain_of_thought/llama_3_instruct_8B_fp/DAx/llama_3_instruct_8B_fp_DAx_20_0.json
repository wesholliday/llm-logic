We want to know if we can infer \"The fleeg did not surn\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned. This is a conditional statement, and the antecedent (the condition) is \"the fleeg was bluttered\". The consequent (the result) is \"it surned\".\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the fleeg was not bluttered. This is a categorical statement that contradicts the antecedent of the first statement.\n\nSince the antecedent of the first statement is false (the fleeg was not bluttered), we cannot conclude that the consequent is true (it did not surn). The conditional statement only tells us what happens if the condition is met, but it does not tell us what happens if the condition is not met.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the fleeg did not surn.\n\nAnswer: no",
