The sneg was not crampled\n\nWe can analyze the first statement as a conditional statement, where \"the sneg was crampled\" is the antecedent and \"the sneg sproted the frink\" is the consequent. This means that if the sneg was crampled, then it is implied that the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nThe second statement, \"The sneg was not crampled\", is a negation of the antecedent in the first statement. This means that the condition \"the sneg was crampled\" is not true.\n\nUsing the principle of modus tollens, we can infer that if the antecedent is false, then the consequent is also false. In this case, since \"the sneg was not crampled\" is true, we can conclude that \"the sneg sproted the frink\" is also false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
