The flob was not skizzled\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the flob was skizzled, then it movated. However, this does not provide any information about the flob's movation status if it was not skizzled.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the flob was not skizzled. But this does not necessarily mean that the flob was not movated. The flob could have been movated even if it was not skizzled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the flob was not movated based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
