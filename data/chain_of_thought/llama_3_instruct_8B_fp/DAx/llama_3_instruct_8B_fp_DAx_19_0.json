The smonk was not vreebled\n\nWe can analyze the first statement as a conditional statement, where \"vreebled\" is the antecedent and \"plagged\" is the consequent. This means that if the smonk is vreebled, then it must be plagged.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the smonk was not vreebled. Since the antecedent of the first statement is not true, we cannot conclude that the smonk is plagged.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly conclude that the smonk was not plagged. The first statement only tells us that if the smonk is vreebled, then it is plagged, but it does not provide any information about the smonk's plagging status when it is not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: no",
