The flugel was not blimmed\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the flugel was blimmed, then it was also zargled. However, statement 2 tells us that the flugel was not blimmed. Since the flugel was not blimmed, we cannot conclude that it was zargled.\n\nThe original statement 1 only provides a conditional relationship between blimmed and zargled, and does not provide a direct relationship between not blimmed and not zargled. Therefore, we cannot infer that the flugel was not zargled solely based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
