We need to determine if we can infer \"The zinger was not smoogled\" from these statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the zinger was fraggled) is false, the consequent (the zinger was smoogled) is also false. However, the second statement tells us that the antecedent is indeed false (the zinger was not fraggled).\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that the consequent (the zinger was smoogled) is also false. This means that we cannot infer that the zinger was not smoogled, because the original conditional statement does not provide any information about the zinger's smoogled status when it is not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: no",
