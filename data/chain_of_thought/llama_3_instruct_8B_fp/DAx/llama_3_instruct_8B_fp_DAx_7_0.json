The whiffle was not shanked.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the whiffle was shanked, then it tinked. However, statement 2 tells us that the whiffle was not shanked. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the whiffle tinked.\n\nThe original statement 1 only establishes a relationship between \"shanked\" and \"tinked\" when the whiffle is shanked. It does not provide any information about what happens when the whiffle is not shanked. Therefore, we cannot infer that the whiffle did not tink.\n\nAnswer: no",
