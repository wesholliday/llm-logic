We want to know if we can infer \"The shank was not nugged\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the shank was plooked, then it was also nugged. But the second statement tells us that the shank was not plooked. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the shank was nugged.\n\nThe first statement only provides a relationship between being plooked and being nugged, but it does not provide any information about the shank's status when it is not plooked. Since we know the shank was not plooked, we cannot make any conclusions about whether it was nugged or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
