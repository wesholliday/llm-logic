We need to determine if we can infer \"The twonk was not varnished\" from these statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the twonk was plinked) is false, then the consequent (it was varnished) is also false. However, the second statement tells us that the antecedent is indeed false (the twonk was not plinked).\n\nUsing the principle of modus tollens, we can conclude that the consequent (it was varnished) is also false. This means that we cannot infer that the twonk was not varnished.\n\nAnswer: no",
