            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" and \"The sprocket was not cranked\". We need to determine if we can infer \"The sprocket was not daggled\" from these statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the sprocket was cranked) is not met, then the consequence (the sprocket was daggled) will not occur. However, the second statement tells us that the condition (the sprocket was not cranked) is indeed met.\n\nSince the condition is not met, we cannot conclude that the consequence (the sprocket was daggled) occurs. In other words, we cannot infer that the sprocket was daggled.\n\nAnswer: no",
