The splat was not morphed.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the splat was morphed, then it quanked. However, statement 2 tells us that the splat was not morphed. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the splat quanked.\n\nThe original statement 1 only provides a conditional relationship between morphing and quanking, but it does not provide a direct relationship between not morphing and not quanking. Therefore, we cannot infer that the splat did not quank solely based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
