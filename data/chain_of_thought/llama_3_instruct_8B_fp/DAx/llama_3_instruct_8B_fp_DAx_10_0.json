The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the wug being sproinged) is false, then the consequent (the wug being garpled) must also be false. The second statement tells us that the antecedent is indeed false. Therefore, we can conclude that the consequent is also false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
