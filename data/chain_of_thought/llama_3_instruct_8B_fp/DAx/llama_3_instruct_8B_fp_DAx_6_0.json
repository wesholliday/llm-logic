The grommet was not sploffed.\n\nWe are trying to infer the statement: The grommet did not plop the frink.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can conclude that if the grommet was sploffed, it would plop the frink. However, statement 2 tells us that the grommet was not sploffed. This means that the condition for the grommet to plop the frink (i.e., being sploffed) is not met.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that the grommet did not plop the frink. The grommet might have plooped the frink for some other reason, or it might not have plooped the frink at all. We simply don't have enough information to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
