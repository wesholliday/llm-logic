We need to determine if we can infer \"The glip was not tragged\" from these statements.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the glip was slogged, then it was also tragged. However, the second statement tells us that the glip was not slogged. This means that the condition for the first statement is not met, and therefore we cannot conclude that the glip was tragged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
