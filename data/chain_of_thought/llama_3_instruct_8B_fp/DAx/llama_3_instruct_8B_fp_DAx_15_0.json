We need to determine if we can infer \"The dreb was not spened\" from these statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (\"the dreb was vroombed\") is false, then the consequent (\"the dreb was spened\") is also false. However, the second statement \"The dreb was not vroombed\" tells us that the antecedent is indeed false.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that the consequent \"the dreb was spened\" is also false. This does not necessarily mean that the dreb was not spened, but rather that we cannot conclude that it was spened.\n\nAnswer: no",
