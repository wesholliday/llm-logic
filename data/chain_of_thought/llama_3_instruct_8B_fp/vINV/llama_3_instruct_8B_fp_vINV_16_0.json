            "content": "Explanation: The argument is an example of a conditional argument, where the conclusion is derived from the premise using the rules of conditional logic. The premise states that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim. This can be represented as a conditional statement: \"If (shirt is cotton) then (pants are denim)\". The conclusion states that if the shirt is not cotton, then the pants are not denim. This can be represented as another conditional statement: \"If (shirt is not cotton) then (pants are not denim)\".\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise states that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim. This implies that the pants are denim only when the shirt is cotton. The conclusion states that if the shirt is not cotton, then the pants are not denim. This implies that the pants are not denim when the shirt is not cotton.\n\nThe key insight here is that the conclusion is logically following from the premise. If the shirt is not cotton, then the pants cannot be denim, because the premise states that the pants are denim only when the shirt is cotton. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
