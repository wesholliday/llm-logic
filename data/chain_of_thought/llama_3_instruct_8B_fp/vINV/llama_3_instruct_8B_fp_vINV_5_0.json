            "content": "Explanation: The argument is an example of a conditional argument, where the conclusion is derived from the premise using modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid argument form that states: \"If A implies B, and not-B, then not-A\". In this case, the premise \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" can be rewritten as \"If Jeff played basketball, then it is true that Amy played tennis\". The conclusion \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis\" can be rewritten as \"If not-Jeff played basketball, then not-Amy played tennis\".\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it follows the correct application of modus tollens. If the premise is true, and the antecedent of the premise (Jeff playing basketball) is negated, then the consequent of the premise (Amy playing tennis) must also be negated. This is because the premise states that Jeff playing basketball implies Amy playing tennis, and if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\n\nAnswer: yes",
