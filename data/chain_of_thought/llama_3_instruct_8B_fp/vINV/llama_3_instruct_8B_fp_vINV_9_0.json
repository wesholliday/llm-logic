            "content": "Explanation: The argument is an example of a conditional argument, where the conclusion is also a conditional statement. The premise states that if Lisa buys the red shirt, then Mark buys the blue shirt. The conclusion states that if Lisa does not buy the red shirt, then Mark does not buy the blue shirt. The key to determining the validity of this argument is to examine the relationships between the antecedents and consequents of the conditional statements.\n\nThe premise implies that the two events (Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt) are causally related, and that if one occurs, the other must also occur. The conclusion is logically following from this premise, as it is simply the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is obtained by swapping the antecedent and consequent, and negating both.\n\nSince the conclusion is logically following from the premise, and the premise is a true statement, the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
