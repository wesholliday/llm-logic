            "content": "Explanation: The argument is an example of a conditional argument, where the conclusion is derived from the premise using logical rules. The premise states that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. This can be represented as a conditional statement: \"If A (apple is red), then B (banana is yellow)\". The conclusion states that if the apple is not red, then the banana is not yellow. This can be represented as another conditional statement: \"If not A (apple is not red), then not B (banana is not yellow)\".\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise only provides information about the relationship between the apple being red and the banana being yellow. It does not provide any information about the relationship between the apple being not red and the banana being not yellow.\n\nHowever, we can use the principle of contraposition to derive the conclusion from the premise. Contraposition states that if \"If A, then B\" is true, then \"If not B, then not A\" is also true. In this case, we can apply contraposition to the premise: \"If A (apple is red), then B (banana is yellow)\" to get \"If not B (banana is not yellow), then not A (apple is not red)\".\n\nThis derived conclusion matches the original conclusion, which states \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\". Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
