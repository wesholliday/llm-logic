            "content": "Explanation: The argument is an example of a conditional argument, where the conclusion is derived from the premise by applying the same conditional structure. The premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. The conclusion is derived by applying the same structure to the negation of the premise, stating that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nThe key to determining the validity of this argument is to examine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, the premise establishes a relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence at the wedding. If Mary's presence implies Sue's presence, then it is reasonable to conclude that Mary's absence would imply Sue's absence.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it is a correct application of the conditional structure. The conclusion logically follows from the premise, and the relationship between the two statements is consistent and coherent.\n\nAnswer: yes",
