            "content": "Explanation: The argument is an example of a conditional argument, where the conclusion is derived from the premise using logical rules. The premise states that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. This can be represented as a conditional statement: \"If P (doll is plastic) then Q (truck is metal)\". The conclusion states that if the doll is not plastic, then the truck is not metal. This can be represented as another conditional statement: \"If not P (doll is not plastic) then not Q (truck is not metal)\".\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise states that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. This implies that the truck being metal is dependent on the doll being plastic. The conclusion states that if the doll is not plastic, then the truck is not metal. This implies that the truck not being metal is dependent on the doll not being plastic.\n\nThe key question is whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise. The answer is yes, because the conclusion is simply the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is obtained by swapping the antecedent and the consequent, and then negating both. In this case, the contrapositive of the premise \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P\". This is exactly the form of the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
