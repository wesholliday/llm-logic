            "content": "Explanation: The argument is an example of a conditional argument, where the conclusion is derived from the premise by applying the same conditional structure. The premise states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. The conclusion states that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo. To determine the validity of the argument, we need to examine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nThe key insight here is that the conclusion is not a direct logical consequence of the premise. Instead, the conclusion is derived by applying the same conditional structure to the negation of the premise. Specifically, the conclusion is saying that if the antecedent of the premise is negated (i.e., Joe did not go to the park), then the consequent of the premise must also be negated (i.e., Lucy did not go to the zoo).\n\nThis type of argument is known as a \"contrapositive\" argument, where the conclusion is derived by applying the same conditional structure to the negation of the premise. Contrapositive arguments are generally valid, as long as the original conditional statement is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
