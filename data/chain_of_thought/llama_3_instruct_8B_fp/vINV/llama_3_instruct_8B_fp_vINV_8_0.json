            "content": "Explanation: The argument is an example of a conditional argument, where the conclusion is derived from the premise. The premise states that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is awake. This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent (the vampire being awake) is related to the consequent (the mummy being awake) by the \"if-then\" relationship. The conclusion is trying to derive a new conditional statement, where the antecedent is the opposite of the original antecedent (the vampire not being awake), and the consequent is the opposite of the original consequent (the mummy not being awake).\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logic. Specifically, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise, without any additional assumptions or information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
