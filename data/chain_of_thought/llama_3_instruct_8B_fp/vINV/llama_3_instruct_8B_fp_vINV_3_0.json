            "content": "Explanation: The argument is an example of a conditional argument, where the conclusion is derived from the premise using the rules of conditional logic. The premise states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. The conclusion states that if the book was not written by James, then it is not a mystery novel. To determine the validity of the argument, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if it follows logically from the premise.\n\nThe conclusion is not a direct negation of the premise, but rather a conditional statement that is derived from the premise. The conclusion is saying that if the book was not written by James, then it is not a mystery novel. This is a valid conclusion because it is logically following from the premise.\n\nThe premise is saying that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. This implies that if the book was not written by James, then it cannot be a mystery novel. This is because the premise is setting up a conditional relationship between the author and the genre of the book.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
