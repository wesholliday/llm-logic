            "content": "Explanation: The given sentence \"The blimple might be snorked and frobbed\" implies that the blimple has the possibility of being both snorked and frobbed. The use of the word \"and\" suggests that these are two separate actions that can occur to the blimple. Since snorking and frobbing are two distinct actions, we can infer that the blimple might be frobbed, as it is already established that it might be snorked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
