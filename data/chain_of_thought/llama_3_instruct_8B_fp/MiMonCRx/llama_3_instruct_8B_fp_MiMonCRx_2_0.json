The word \"snorked\" is not a common verb in English, and it's likely that it's a made-up or nonsense word. However, the word \"wumbled\" is a possible verb that could be used in a sentence. Since \"quibble\" is a noun, it's possible that it could be the object of the verb \"wumbled\", which means to confuse or disorient.\n\nAnswer: yes",
