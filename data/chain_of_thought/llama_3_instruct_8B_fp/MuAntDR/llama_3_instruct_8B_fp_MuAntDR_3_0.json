The phrase \"or\" is used to indicate that the keys could be in either the drawer or on the table, or possibly both. However, the statement doesn't provide any additional information that would allow us to conclude that the keys were specifically on the table. We can't rule out the possibility that the keys were actually in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: no",
