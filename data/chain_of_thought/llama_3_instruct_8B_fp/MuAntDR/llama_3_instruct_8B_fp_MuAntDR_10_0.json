            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The document must have been signed or notarized\" is a disjunction, which means it presents two options: either the document was signed or it was notarized. The word \"or\" is used to indicate that one of the two options is sufficient to meet the condition. However, the statement does not explicitly state that the document must have been notarized, only that it must have been signed or notarized.\n\nIn this case, we cannot infer that the document must have been notarized because the statement does not rule out the possibility that the document was signed instead. The statement only provides a choice between the two options, but it does not imply that one option is more preferred or necessary than the other.\n\nAnswer: no",
