            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package must have been delivered yesterday or the day before\" is a disjunction, which means it presents two possibilities. It's saying that the package was delivered either yesterday or the day before, but not necessarily both. The statement doesn't provide any information about which of the two options is more likely or if they are mutually exclusive. Therefore, we cannot infer that the package must have been delivered the day before, as it could have been delivered yesterday instead.\n\nAnswer: no",
