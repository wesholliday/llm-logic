            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday or extended\" presents two possibilities: either the project was completed by Friday or it was extended. The word \"or\" is a disjunction, which means that one of the two options must be true. However, the statement does not explicitly state that the project was extended. It only provides two alternatives, but it does not necessarily imply that the project was extended.\n\nAnswer: no",
