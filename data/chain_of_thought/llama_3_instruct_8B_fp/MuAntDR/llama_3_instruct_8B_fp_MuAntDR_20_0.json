            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The event must have been formal or semi-formal\" provides two options for the type of event: formal or semi-formal. The use of \"or\" implies that both options are possible, and the event could have been either formal or semi-formal. However, the statement does not provide any information that would allow us to rule out the possibility of the event being formal. Therefore, we cannot infer that the event must have been semi-formal.\n\nAnswer: no",
