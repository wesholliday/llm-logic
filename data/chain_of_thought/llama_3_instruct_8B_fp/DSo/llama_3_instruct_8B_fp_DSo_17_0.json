The second statement says that either the scarf is stuffed in the backpack or it is draped on the coat rack. We can use the first statement to eliminate one of the options in the second statement. Since the scarf is not draped on the coat rack, we can conclude that the scarf must be stuffed in the backpack. This is because the second statement says that either the scarf is stuffed in the backpack or it is draped on the coat rack, and we have already eliminated the latter option.\n\nAnswer: yes",
