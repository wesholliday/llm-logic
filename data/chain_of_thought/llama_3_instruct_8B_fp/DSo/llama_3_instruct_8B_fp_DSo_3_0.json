From the first statement, we know that the keys are not in the cabinet. The second statement is a disjunction, which means it is saying that one of the two options is true. Since we know that the keys are not in the cabinet, we can conclude that the other option must be true, which is that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
