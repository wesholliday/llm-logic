From the first statement, we know that the shoes are not lined up by the door. From the second statement, we know that there are only two possibilities: either the shoes are in the closet or they are lined up by the door. Since we know that they are not lined up by the door, we can conclude that the shoes must be in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
