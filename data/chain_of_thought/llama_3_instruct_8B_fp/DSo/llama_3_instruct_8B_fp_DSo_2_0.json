From the first statement, we know that the book is not resting on the table. From the second statement, we know that the book is either on the shelf or resting on the table. Since we know the book is not resting on the table, we can conclude that it must be on the shelf. This is because the only other option, resting on the table, has been ruled out.\n\nAnswer: yes",
