The second statement says that either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch. We can combine these two statements to get a conclusion. Since the remote control is not hiding under the couch, we can conclude that it must be on the coffee table. This is because the second statement says that either it is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch, and we have already eliminated the possibility of it being under the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
