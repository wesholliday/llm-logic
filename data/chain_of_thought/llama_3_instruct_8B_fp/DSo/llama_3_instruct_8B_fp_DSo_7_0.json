The second statement says that either the umbrella is in the car or it is tucked away in the closet. We are asked to infer whether the umbrella is in the car.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the umbrella is not tucked away in the closet. This means that the only other option left is that the umbrella is in the car. The second statement says that either the umbrella is in the car or it is tucked away in the closet, but we already know that it's not tucked away in the closet. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
