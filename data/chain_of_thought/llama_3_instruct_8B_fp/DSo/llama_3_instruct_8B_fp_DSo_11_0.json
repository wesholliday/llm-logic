From the first statement, we know that the newspaper is not sitting on the porch. The second statement provides two possibilities: either the newspaper is in the driveway or it is sitting on the porch. Since we already know that the newspaper is not sitting on the porch, we can eliminate that possibility. This leaves us with only one option: the newspaper must be in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes",
