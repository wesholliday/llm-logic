From the first statement, we know that the milk is not in the fridge. The second statement provides two possibilities: either the milk is on the counter or it is chilling in the fridge. Since we already know that the milk is not in the fridge, we can eliminate the second possibility. This leaves us with only one option: the milk must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
