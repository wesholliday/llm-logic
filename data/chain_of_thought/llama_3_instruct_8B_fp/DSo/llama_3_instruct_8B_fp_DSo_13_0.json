The second statement is a disjunction, which means it is saying that one of the two options is true. The first statement is saying that the second option (\"it is sitting on the shelf\") is not true. Therefore, we can conclude that the first option (\"it is in the toy box\") must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
