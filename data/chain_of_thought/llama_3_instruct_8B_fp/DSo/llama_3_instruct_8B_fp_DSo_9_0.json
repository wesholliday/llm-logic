The second statement says that either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it is blending in on the floor. We can infer that the missing puzzle piece is either in the box or on the floor, but we don't have enough information to conclude that it is in the box.\n\nHowever, we can use the first statement to eliminate one of the possibilities. Since the missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor, we can conclude that it is not on the floor. This means that the only remaining possibility is that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
