From the first statement, we know that the sunglasses are not on her head. The second statement provides two possibilities: either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are on her head. Since we already know that they are not on her head, we can eliminate the second possibility. This leaves us with only one option: the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
