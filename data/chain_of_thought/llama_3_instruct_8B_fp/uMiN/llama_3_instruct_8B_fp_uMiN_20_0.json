This does not necessarily mean that the sunglasses are definitely not in the bag, but rather that it's a possibility. To infer that the sunglasses must not be in the bag, we would need more information or a stronger statement. The original statement only suggests that it's possible that the sunglasses are not in the bag, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that they are.\n\nAnswer: no",
