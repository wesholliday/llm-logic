This does not necessarily mean that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, but rather that it is a possibility. However, it does suggest that we cannot conclude with certainty that Lisa did buy the red shirt. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
