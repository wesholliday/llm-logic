This does not necessarily mean that the alien did not visit Mars, as there is also a possibility that it did visit Mars. The statement is simply acknowledging that we cannot be certain about the alien's visit to Mars. To infer that the alien must not have visited Mars would be an unjustified conclusion, as we have no evidence to support this claim.\n\nAnswer: no",
