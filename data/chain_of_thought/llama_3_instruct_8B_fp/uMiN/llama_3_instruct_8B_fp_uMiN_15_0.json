This possibility is not necessarily the only possibility, but it is one of the possibilities. The statement does not rule out the possibility that the shoes are in the closet, it only suggests that it is not certain. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the shoes must not be in the closet, but rather that we cannot be certain about their location.\n\nAnswer: no",
