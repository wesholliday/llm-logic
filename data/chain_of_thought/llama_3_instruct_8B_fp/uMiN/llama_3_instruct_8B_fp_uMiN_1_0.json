It only suggests that there is a chance that Mary was not present. To infer that Mary must not have been at the wedding, we would need more information or a stronger statement, such as \"Mary was not at the wedding\" or \"It is impossible for Mary to have been at the wedding\". The original statement does not provide enough evidence to conclude that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
