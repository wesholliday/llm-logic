This does not necessarily mean that the griffin was not in the forest, as there is still a possibility that it was. However, it does suggest that we cannot conclude with certainty that the griffin was in the forest. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest, as the possibility of it not being there is not ruled out.\n\nAnswer: yes",
