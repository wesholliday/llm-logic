This does not necessarily mean that Sue did not choose pizza, but rather that it is a possibility. To infer that Sue must not have chosen pizza, we would need more information or a stronger statement. The original statement only provides a possibility, not a certainty. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Sue must not have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: no",
