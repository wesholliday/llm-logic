This is a statement of uncertainty, indicating that the pen's presence or absence in the bag is not certain. From this statement, we cannot conclude that the pen must not be in the bag, as the possibility of it being in the bag still exists. However, we can infer that it is not the case that the pen must be in the bag, as the statement explicitly states that there is a possibility it might not be.\n\nAnswer: yes",
