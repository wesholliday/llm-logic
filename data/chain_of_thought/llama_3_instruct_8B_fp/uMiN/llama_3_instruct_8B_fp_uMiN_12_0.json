This does not necessarily mean that the jacket is not draped over the chair, as it could still be. However, it does suggest that we cannot assume with certainty that the jacket is draped over the chair. Therefore, we can infer that it's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
