Publishing data indicates thrillers will likely be the #1 genre this year, followed closely by romances, with mysteries far behind. These genres lead the market, so if romances aren\u2019t #1, then if thrillers aren\u2019t, mysteries will be. Moreover, thrillers likely will lead sales and hence romances likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if thrillers aren\u2019t #1, mysteries will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: The argument states that thrillers will likely be the #1 genre this year, followed closely by romances, with mysteries far behind. It also states that if romances aren\u2019t #1, then if thrillers aren\u2019t, mysteries will be. However, the argument does not provide any information about the likelihood of thrillers not being #1. It only provides information about the relative positions of thrillers, romances, and mysteries. Therefore, we cannot conclude that it is likely that if thrillers aren\u2019t #1, mysteries will be.\n\nAnswer: no",
