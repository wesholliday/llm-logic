    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the stock market, real estate market, and bond market are the primary investment vehicles. According to financial advisors, the stock market likely will see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns. These markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn\u2019t have the highest returns, then if stocks don\u2019t, bonds will. Moreover, stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if stocks don\u2019t have the highest returns, bonds will?",

            "content": "Explanation: The argument states that according to financial advisors, the stock market is likely to have the highest returns, followed by real estate, and then bonds. It also states that if real estate doesn't have the highest returns, then bonds will. However, the argument does not provide any information about the relationship between stocks and bonds. It only provides information about the relative performance of stocks, real estate, and bonds. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if stocks don't have the highest returns, bonds will.\n\nAnswer: no",
