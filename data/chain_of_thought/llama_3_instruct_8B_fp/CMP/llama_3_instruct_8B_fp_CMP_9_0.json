    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it\u2019s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be. Moreover, it\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: The argument states that apples are likely to be the top-selling fruit, followed by bananas, and then oranges. It also states that if bananas aren't the top seller, then oranges will be. However, the argument does not provide any information about what will happen if apples aren't the top seller. It only provides information about the likely order of the top-selling fruits when apples are the top seller.\n\nThe argument also states that if apples aren't the top seller, then bananas won't be. This implies that if apples aren't the top seller, then oranges will be the top seller. However, this conclusion is not directly supported by the original data, which only provides information about the likely order of the top-selling fruits when apples are the top seller.\n\nAnswer: no",
