    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don\u2019t increase the most, then if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won\u2019t increase the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

            "content": "Explanation: The argument states that rents are expected to increase the most, followed by home prices, and then mortgage rates. It also states that if home prices don't increase the most, then if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Additionally, it is stated that rents are likely to increase the most, which implies that home prices are unlikely to increase the most. The question asks whether it follows that if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.\n\nThe argument is trying to establish a conditional statement, which is \"if rents don't increase the most, then mortgage rates will increase the most\". The argument provides two premises: (1) if home prices don't increase the most, then if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most, and (2) rents are likely to increase the most, which implies that home prices are unlikely to increase the most.\n\nFrom premise (1), we can infer that if rents don't increase the most, then mortgage rates will increase the most, as long as home prices don't increase the most. From premise (2), we can infer that home prices are unlikely to increase the most. Combining these two inferences, we can conclude that if rents don't increase the most, then mortgage rates will increase the most.\n\nAnswer: yes",
