    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": "Explanation: The passage states that Tennessee is likely to add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, and Missouri's growth is significantly lower. It also states that if Georgia doesn't add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn't, Missouri will. Additionally, it is stated that Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won't. From this information, we can deduce that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, it is likely that Georgia will add the most jobs. However, the passage does not provide any information about what will happen if Georgia doesn't add the most jobs. Therefore, we cannot conclude that it is likely that Missouri will add the most jobs if Tennessee doesn't.\n\nAnswer: no",
