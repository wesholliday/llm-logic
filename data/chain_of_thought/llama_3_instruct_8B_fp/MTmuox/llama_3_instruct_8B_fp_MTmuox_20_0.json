            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned\" and \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned\". The first statement is a negation of the form \"not A\", where A is the statement \"the fleeg must have been surned\". The second statement is a conditional statement of the form \"if B, then C\", where B is the statement \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and C is the statement \"it must have been surned\".\n\nWe can start by analyzing the second statement. If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned. This means that if the fleeg was bluttered, it is impossible for it not to have been surned. In other words, the two statements \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and \"it must have been surned\" are logically equivalent.\n\nNow, let's look at the first statement. It's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned. This means that it is possible for the fleeg not to have been surned. However, we know that if the fleeg was bluttered, it must have been surned. Therefore, if the fleeg was not surned, it cannot have been bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
