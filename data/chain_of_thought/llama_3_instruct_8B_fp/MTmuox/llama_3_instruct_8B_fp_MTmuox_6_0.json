'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink'\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that the grommet did not necessarily have to plop the frink. This does not provide any information about whether the grommet was sploffed or not.\n\nFrom statement 2, we can infer that if the grommet was sploffed, then it must have plop the frink. This does not provide any information about whether the grommet was sploffed or not.\n\nWe cannot directly infer 'The grommet was not sploffed' from these two statements. We would need additional information to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
