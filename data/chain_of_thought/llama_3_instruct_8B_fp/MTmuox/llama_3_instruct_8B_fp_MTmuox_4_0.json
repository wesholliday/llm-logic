We want to know if we can infer that \"The fribble was not snurgled\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the fribble's crinkedness is not necessarily true. This does not give us any information about the fribble's snurgledness.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement. It says that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked. This does not imply that the fribble was not snurgled. It only implies that if the fribble was snurgled, then it would have crinked.\n\nWe cannot infer that the fribble was not snurgled from these two statements. We do not have any information that would allow us to conclude that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: no",
