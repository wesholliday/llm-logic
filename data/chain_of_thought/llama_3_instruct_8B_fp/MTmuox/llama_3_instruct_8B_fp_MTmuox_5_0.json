            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"It's not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled\" and \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled\". The first statement is a negation of the possibility that the zinger must have been smoogled, which means that it is possible that the zinger was not smoogled. The second statement is a conditional statement that says if the zinger was fraggled, then it must have been smoogled. This implies that if the zinger was not smoogled, then it was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
