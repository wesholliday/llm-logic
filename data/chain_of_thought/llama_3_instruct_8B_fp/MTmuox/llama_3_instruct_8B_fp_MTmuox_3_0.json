We want to know if we can infer \"The splat was not morphed\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that it's not necessary for the splat to have quanked. This doesn't give us any information about whether the splat was morphed or not.\n\nThe second statement tells us that if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked. This implies that if the splat was not morphed, then it didn't have to quank. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the splat was not morphed. It's possible that the splat was morphed, but for some reason, it didn't have to quank.\n\nSince we can't conclude that the splat was not morphed from the given statements, we cannot infer \"The splat was not morphed\".\n\nAnswer: no",
