This implies that being fleeked is a sufficient condition for being snugged. \n\nNow, we want to infer whether the clug was not fleeked. \n\nIf the clug was not fleeked, then it must not have been snugged (since being fleeked is a sufficient condition for being snugged). \n\nBut this is exactly what the first statement says: \"It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged\". \n\nSo, we can conclude that the clug was not fleeked. \n\nAnswer: yes",
