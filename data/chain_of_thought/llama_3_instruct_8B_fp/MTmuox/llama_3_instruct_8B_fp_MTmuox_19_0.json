We want to know if we can infer \"The smonk was not vreebled\".\n\nFrom the second statement, we can conclude that if the smonk was vreebled, then it must have plagged. This implies that plagging is a necessary condition for being vreebled.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that it's not the case that the smonk must have plagged. This means that plagging is not a necessary condition for the smonk.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the smonk was vreebled. If it was vreebled, then it must have plagged, according to the second statement. But we know that plagging is not a necessary condition for the smonk, so it's possible that the smonk was vreebled without plagging.\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude that the smonk was not vreebled. We can only say that if the smonk was vreebled, then it must have plagged, but we don't have enough information to rule out the possibility that the smonk was vreebled.\n\nAnswer: no",
