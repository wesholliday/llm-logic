This implies that the floob cannot be in both places at the same time, nor can it be in neither place. The statement does not explicitly state that the floob cannot be in the bimboozle, but it does not provide any information that would suggest it can be in both places either. Therefore, we cannot infer that the floob must be on the quibble, as it could still be in the bimboozle.\n\nAnswer: no",
