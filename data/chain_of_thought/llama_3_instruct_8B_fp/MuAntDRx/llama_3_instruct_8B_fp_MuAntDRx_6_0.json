The word \"or\" is used to indicate that one of the two options must be true. However, this does not necessarily mean that the second option (bimboozle) is true. The statement only provides a choice between the two options, but it does not provide any information that would allow us to conclude that bimboozle is the correct option.\n\nAnswer: no",
