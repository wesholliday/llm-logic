From the first statement, we know that the sunglasses must be either on her head or in her bag. The second statement tells us that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be on her head, which means that the sunglasses cannot be on her head. Therefore, we can conclude that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
