            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer\" and \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand\". The first statement is a disjunction, which means it is saying that one of the two options must be true. The second statement is a negation, which means it is saying that the first option is not true.\n\nFrom the second statement, we can conclude that the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand. This means that the first option in the disjunction is not true.\n\nSince the first option is not true, the only remaining option is that the notebook is in the drawer. Therefore, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
