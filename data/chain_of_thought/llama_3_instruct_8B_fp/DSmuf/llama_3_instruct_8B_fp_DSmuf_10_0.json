It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the missing sock is either under the bed or in the laundry basket. From statement 2, we know that it's not the case that the missing sock is under the bed. This means that the missing sock cannot be under the bed.\n\nSince the missing sock is not under the bed, and it's either under the bed or in the laundry basket, we can conclude that the missing sock must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
