We want to know if we can deduce \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" from these statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the consequence (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true. However, this does not mean that if the consequence is true, then the condition must also be true.\n\nThe second statement \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" only tells us that the consequence of the first statement is true, but it does not provide any information about the condition. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
