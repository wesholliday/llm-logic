Erin took a train\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. This is a conditional statement, and it does not directly imply that Sam took a plane. It only provides a relationship between Sam's action and Erin's action.\n\nStatement 2, \"Erin took a train\", provides additional information about Erin's action, but it does not provide any direct information about Sam's action.\n\nSince we do not have any additional information about Sam's action, we cannot deduce that Sam took a plane. The given statements do not provide a sufficient basis to conclude that Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: no",
