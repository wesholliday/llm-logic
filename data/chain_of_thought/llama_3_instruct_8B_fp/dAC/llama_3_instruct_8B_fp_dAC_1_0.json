            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\n2. Sue was at the wedding\n\nWe can start by analyzing the first statement, which is a conditional statement. It says that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. This implies that Sue's presence at the wedding is dependent on Mary's presence.\n\nThe second statement, \"Sue was at the wedding\", provides additional information. Since Sue was indeed at the wedding, we can conclude that the condition in the first statement is met, i.e., Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly conclude that Mary was at the wedding from the second statement alone, because the second statement only tells us that Sue was at the wedding, not that Mary was there.\n\nTherefore, we need the first statement to connect the two pieces of information. Since the first statement establishes a relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence, and we know that Sue was at the wedding, we can infer that Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
