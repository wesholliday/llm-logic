The muffins were blueberry\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the muffins are indeed blueberry. However, this information does not provide any direct evidence about the cake. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it only provides information about the relationship between the cake and the muffins under certain conditions.\n\nThe condition in this case is that the cake is chocolate. If we assume that the cake is not chocolate, the first statement does not provide any information about the muffins. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the cake is chocolate based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
