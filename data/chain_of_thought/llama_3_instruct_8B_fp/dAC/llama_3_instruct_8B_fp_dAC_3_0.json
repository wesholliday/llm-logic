We want to know if we can deduce \"The book was written by James\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. This is a conditional statement, and the condition is \"the book was written by James\". \n\nThe second statement tells us that the book is indeed a mystery novel. \n\nHowever, we cannot directly conclude that the book was written by James. The first statement only tells us that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel, but it does not tell us that the book was written by James. \n\nWe need more information to conclude that the book was written by James. For example, if we had another statement like \"The book was written by James\", then we could deduce that the book was written by James.\n\nAnswer: no",
