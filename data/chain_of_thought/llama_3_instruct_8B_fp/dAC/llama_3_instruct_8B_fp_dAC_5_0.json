The conditional statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" implies that if Jeff played basketball, Amy played tennis. The categorical statement \"Amy played tennis\" tells us that Amy did play tennis. However, it does not provide any information about Jeff's actions. We cannot conclude that Jeff played basketball because the conditional statement only provides a relationship between Jeff's actions and Amy's actions, but it does not provide a direct relationship between Jeff's actions and the conclusion.",
