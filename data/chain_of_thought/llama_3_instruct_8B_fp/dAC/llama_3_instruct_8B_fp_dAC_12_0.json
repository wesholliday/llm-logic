The conditional statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" implies that there is a relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo. The categorical statement \"Lucy went to the zoo\" provides additional information about Lucy's actions. However, the conditional statement does not provide a direct link between Joe's actions and the conclusion that Joe went to the park. We cannot logically conclude that Joe went to the park solely based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
