However, the second statement \"It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter\" suggests that there is no necessary connection between the robot's visit to Jupiter and the alien's visit to Mars.\n\nFrom these statements, we cannot conclude that the alien did not visit Mars. The statements only provide information about the relationship between the alien's visit to Mars and the robot's visit to Jupiter, but do not provide any information about the alien's visit to Mars itself.\n\nAnswer: no",
