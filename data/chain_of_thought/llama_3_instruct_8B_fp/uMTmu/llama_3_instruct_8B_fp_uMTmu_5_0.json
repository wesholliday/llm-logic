However, the second statement \"it's not the case that Amy must have played tennis\" suggests that Amy's tennis playing is not necessarily linked to Jeff's basketball playing. This means that even if Jeff did play basketball, Amy might not have played tennis. The absence of a link between Jeff's basketball playing and Amy's tennis playing means that we cannot infer that Jeff did not play basketball.",
