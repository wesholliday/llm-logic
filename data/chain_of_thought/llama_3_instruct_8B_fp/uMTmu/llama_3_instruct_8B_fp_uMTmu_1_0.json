            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" implies a conditional relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence. This means that if Mary was at the wedding, it is necessary for Sue to also be at the wedding. However, the second statement \"it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding\" suggests that Sue's presence is not necessarily tied to Mary's presence. This creates a contradiction, as the first statement implies a necessary relationship between the two, while the second statement denies it.\n\nAnswer: yes",
