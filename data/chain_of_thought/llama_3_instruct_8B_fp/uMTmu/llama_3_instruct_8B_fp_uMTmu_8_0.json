However, the statement \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake\" is a negation of the consequence, which does not necessarily imply that the condition (the vampire being awake) is false.\n\nIn other words, just because the mummy not being awake does not necessarily follow from the vampire being awake, it does not mean that the vampire was not awake. There could be other reasons why the mummy was not awake, unrelated to the vampire's state.\n\nAnswer: no",
