However, this does not necessarily mean that the muffins are blueberry if the cake is not chocolate. The second statement \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry\" is a negation of the first statement, which means that the muffins do not have to be blueberry. This does not provide any information about the cake.\n\nThe key point is that the statements do not provide any direct information about the cake's flavor. The first statement only talks about the muffins, and the second statement only talks about the muffins not being blueberry. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the cake's flavor.\n\nAnswer: no",
