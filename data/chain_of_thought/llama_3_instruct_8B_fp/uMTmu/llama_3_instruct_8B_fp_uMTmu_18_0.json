            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" is a conditional statement, which means that it's saying that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. However, this statement does not provide any information about the material of the doll or truck when the condition is not met. In other words, it only tells us what happens when the doll is plastic, but it doesn't tell us what happens when the doll is not plastic.\n\nThe second statement \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\" is a negation of the previous statement, which means it's saying that the truck does not have to be metal. This statement does not provide any information about the material of the doll.\n\nFrom these statements, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic. We only know that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal, but we don't know what happens when the doll is not plastic. We also don't know the material of the doll or truck.\n\nAnswer: no",
