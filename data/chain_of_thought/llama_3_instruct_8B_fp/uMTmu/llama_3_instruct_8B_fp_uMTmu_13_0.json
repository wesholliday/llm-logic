            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\" is a conditional statement, which means that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. However, this does not mean that the truck must be blue in general. The statement only establishes a relationship between the car and the truck, but it does not provide any information about the truck's color in isolation.\n\nThe second statement \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue\" is a negation of the previous statement, which means that the truck's color is not determined by the car's color. This does not provide any information about the car's color.\n\nFrom these statements, we cannot infer that the car was not red. The statements only provide information about the relationship between the car and the truck, but not about the car's color in isolation.\n\nAnswer: no",
