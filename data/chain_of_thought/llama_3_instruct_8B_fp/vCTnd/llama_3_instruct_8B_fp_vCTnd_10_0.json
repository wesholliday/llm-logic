            "content": "Explanation: The argument is an example of a conditional argument, where the conclusion is derived from the premise using conditional logic. The premise states that if advice was offered, it was not helpful advice. The conclusion states that if helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered. To determine the validity of the argument, we need to examine the logical structure of the argument and see if it follows a valid pattern.\n\nThe argument can be rewritten in a more formal way:\n\nPremise: If (advice was offered) then (advice was not helpful)\nConclusion: If (helpful advice was offered) then (advice was not offered)\n\nThe argument appears to be using a contrapositive structure, where the conclusion is derived by taking the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of the premise would be \"If advice was helpful, then advice was not offered\". This is equivalent to the conclusion, which states \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered\".\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it follows a valid pattern of conditional logic. The conclusion is derived from the premise using the contrapositive structure, which is a valid way to derive a conclusion from a premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
