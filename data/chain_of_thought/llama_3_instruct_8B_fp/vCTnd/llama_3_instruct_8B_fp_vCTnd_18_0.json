            "content": "Explanation: The given argument is an example of a conditional argument, where the conclusion is conditional upon the premise. The premise states that if the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth. The conclusion states that if the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed. To determine the validity of this argument, we need to examine the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise is saying that if the issue was discussed at all, then it was not discussed in depth. This implies that the issue was not thoroughly examined or explored. The conclusion is saying that if the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed. This seems to be a contradictory statement, as discussing something in depth implies that it was thoroughly examined and explored.\n\nThe issue here is that the premise and conclusion are using the same term \"discussed\" in different ways. The premise is using \"discussed\" to mean a superficial or cursory examination, while the conclusion is using \"discussed\" to mean a thorough or in-depth examination. This ambiguity creates a logical contradiction, making the argument invalid.\n\nAnswer: no",
