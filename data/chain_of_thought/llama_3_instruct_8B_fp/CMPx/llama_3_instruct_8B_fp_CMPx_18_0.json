    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a blimfet, a crongle, and a narzil are the leading bafwidgers. Experts expect the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most this year, followed by the crongle, with the narzil bafwidging much less. These are the only major bafwidgers, so if the crongle doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, then if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most. Moreover, the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most, and hence the crongle likely won\u2019t bafwidge the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will?",

            "content": "Explanation: The passage states that the blimfet is expected to bafwidge the most, followed by the crongle, and then the narzil. It also states that if the crongle doesn't bafwidge the most, then if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most. Additionally, it is stated that the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most, and hence the crongle likely won't bafwidge the most. We are asked to determine if it follows that it's likely that, if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, the narzil will.\n\nThe passage provides a clear ranking of the bafwidgers, with the blimfet expected to bafwidge the most, followed by the crongle, and then the narzil. If the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, it means that either the crongle or the narzil will bafwidge the most. Since the crongle likely won't bafwidge the most, it follows that the narzil will bafwidge the most if the blimfet doesn't. Therefore, it is likely that, if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, the narzil will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
