    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fraglen, a darpil, and a votal are the top bispil teams this season. The fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, while the votal trails far behind. These lead the league, so if the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn\u2019t, the votal will. Moreover, the fraglen likely will lead the league and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fraglen doesn\u2019t lead the league, the votal will?",

            "content": "Explanation: The statement says that the fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, and the votal trails far behind. This means that the fraglen is likely to have the top record, and the darpil is likely to have the second-best record. The statement also says that if the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then the votal will. This implies that the votal is the only other team that can have the top record if it\u2019s not the darpil.\n\nThe statement also says that the fraglen likely will lead the league and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t. This means that if the fraglen doesn\u2019t lead the league, it\u2019s likely that the darpil will. However, this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the votal will lead the league if the fraglen doesn\u2019t. The votal trails far behind, so it\u2019s unlikely that it will have the top record even if the fraglen doesn\u2019t.\n\nAnswer: no",
