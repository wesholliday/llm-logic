    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

            "content": "Explanation: The argument states that the jantiz is the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, and the sulect has weaker qualifications. This means that the jantiz has a higher chance of getting the zulision than the cramen, and the cramen has a higher chance than the sulect. The argument also states that if the cramen doesn't get the zulision, then the sulect will, and that the jantiz likely will get the zulision and the cramen likely won't. This suggests that the jantiz's likelihood of getting the zulision is high, and the cramen's likelihood is low.\n\nHowever, the question asks whether it's likely that if the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, the sulect will. This is a different scenario than the original one, where the jantiz likely gets the zulision and the cramen likely doesn't. In this new scenario, the jantiz not getting the zulision means that the cramen has a higher chance of getting it, since the jantiz is no longer in the running. The sulect still has weaker qualifications than the cramen, so it's less likely to get the zulision.\n\nAnswer: no",
