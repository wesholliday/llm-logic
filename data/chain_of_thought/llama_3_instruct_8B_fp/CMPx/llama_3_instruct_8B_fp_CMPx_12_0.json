    "user_prompt": "Suppose a stribben, a vanoon, and a jentapp are applying to rent a bondle. The owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant, followed by the vanoon, while the jentapp seems much less qualified to rent a bondle. Since these are the only applicants, if the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, then if the stribben isn\u2019t selected, the jentapp will be selected. Moreover, the stribben likely will be chosen and hence the vanoon likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the stribben isn\u2019t selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be?",

However, this does not necessarily mean that if the stribben is not selected, the jentapp will be chosen. The owner may still choose the vanoon over the jentapp, even if the stribben is not selected. The fact that the jentapp is the least qualified applicant does not guarantee that they will be chosen if the stribben and vanoon are not selected.\n\nAnswer: no",
