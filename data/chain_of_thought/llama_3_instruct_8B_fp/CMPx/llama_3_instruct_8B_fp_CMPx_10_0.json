    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantole, a dribban, and a cruggit are the most downloaded fillip apps this month. Market watchers expect the fantole likely will retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit download rate significantly lower. These lead the downloads, so if the dribban isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn\u2019t, the cruggit will be. Moreover, the fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fantole isn\u2019t the most downloaded, the cruggit will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: The passage states that the fantole is likely to retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit having a significantly lower download rate. It also states that if the dribban isn't the most downloaded, then the cruggit will be, and that the fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won't. The question asks whether it follows that if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, the cruggit will be.\n\nThe key to this question is the relationship between the fantole, dribban, and cruggit. If the fantole is likely to retain the top spot, and the dribban is likely to be second, then the cruggit is unlikely to be the most downloaded. However, if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, it's possible that the dribban could be, or that the cruggit could be. The passage doesn't provide enough information to determine the likelihood of the cruggit being the most downloaded if the fantole isn't.\n\nAnswer: no",
