    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crastin, a nivet, and a jomial are the top bispets this breeding season. Breeders expect the crastin likely will birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. These lead in birthing, so if the nivet doesn\u2019t birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn\u2019t, the jomial will. Moreover, the crastin likely will lead births and hence the nivet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, the jomial will?",

            "content": "Explanation: The problem states that the crastin is expected to birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, and then the jomial. It also states that if the nivet doesn't birth the most offspring, then the jomial will. Additionally, it's stated that the crastin is likely to lead births, which means that if the crastin doesn't lead births, the nivet will. The question asks whether it's likely that if the crastin doesn't lead births, the jomial will.\n\nFrom the given information, we can conclude that if the crastin doesn't lead births, the nivet will. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the jomial will lead births. The jomial is expected to birth many fewer offspring than the crastin and the nivet, so it's possible that even if the crastin and the nivet don't lead births, the jomial still won't.\n\nAnswer: no",
