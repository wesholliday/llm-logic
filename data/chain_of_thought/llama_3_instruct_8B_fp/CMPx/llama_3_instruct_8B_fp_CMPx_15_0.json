    "user_prompt": "Suppose a fantole, a dribban, and a snorpul have the best odds to win this season's Rizzle Cup. Oddsmakers believe it's most probable the fantole will capture the cup, followed by the dribban, while the snorpul is a heavy longshot. Since these are the only top contenders, if the dribban doesn\u2019t win the cup, then if the fantole doesn\u2019t win, the snorpul will win. Moreover, the fantole likely will win the cup and hence the dribban likely won't win. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will?",

            "content": "Explanation: The problem states that the fantole has the best odds to win, followed by the dribban, and the snorpul is a longshot. This means that the fantole is more likely to win than the dribban, and the dribban is more likely to win than the snorpul. The problem also states that if the dribban doesn't win, then if the fantole doesn't win, the snorpul will win. This implies that the snorpul can only win if the fantole doesn't win and the dribban doesn't win. Additionally, the problem states that the fantole likely will win the cup and hence the dribban likely won't win. This implies that the fantole's likelihood of winning is high, and the dribban's likelihood of winning is low.\n\nHowever, the problem asks whether it's likely that if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will. This is a conditional statement, and we need to consider the likelihood of the fantole not winning and the snorpul winning under those conditions.\n\nAnswer: no",
