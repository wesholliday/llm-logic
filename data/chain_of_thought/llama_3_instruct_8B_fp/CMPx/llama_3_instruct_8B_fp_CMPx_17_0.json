    "user_prompt": "Suppose a flinker, a dringen, and a n\u00fcffen have the best projections to have a breakout season next year. Talent scouts believe it's highly probable the flinker will have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen, while the n\u00fcffen is an outside shot. Since these are the only top prospects, if the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. Moreover, scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season and hence the dringen likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will?",

            "content": "Explanation: The argument states that the talent scouts believe the flinker has the best projections to have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen, and the n\u00fcffen is an outside shot. It also states that if the dringen doesn't have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. Additionally, the scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season and hence the dringen likely won't.\n\nHowever, the argument does not provide any information about the likelihood of the flinker not having a breakout season. It only provides information about the likelihood of the flinker having a breakout season, which is high. Therefore, we cannot conclude that it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will.\n\nAnswer: no",
