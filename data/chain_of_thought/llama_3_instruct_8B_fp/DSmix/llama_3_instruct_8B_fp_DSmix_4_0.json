The fribble might not be crinked\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the fribble is either snurgled or crinked. From statement 2, we know that the fribble might not be crinked. This implies that the fribble is not crinked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled (from statement 1).\n* If the fribble is not snurgled, then it must be crinked (from statement 1), but we know it's not crinked (from statement 2).\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
