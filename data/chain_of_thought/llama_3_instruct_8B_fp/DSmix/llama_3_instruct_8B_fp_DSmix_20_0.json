The fleeg might not be surned.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the fleeg is either bluttered or surned. From statement 2, we know that the fleeg might not be surned. This implies that the fleeg is not necessarily surned.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered (from statement 1).\n* If the fleeg is surned, then it could be either bluttered or not bluttered (from statement 1).\n\nSince we know the fleeg might not be surned (from statement 2), we can conclude that the fleeg is not surned. Therefore, the fleeg must be bluttered (from statement 1).\n\nAnswer: yes",
