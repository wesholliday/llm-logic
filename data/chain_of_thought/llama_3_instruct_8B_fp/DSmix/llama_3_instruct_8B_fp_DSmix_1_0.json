The flugel might not be zargled\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the flugel is either blimmed or it must be zargled. This is an either-or situation, which means that if the flugel is not blimmed, it must be zargled.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the flugel might not be zargled. This implies that there is a possibility that the flugel is not zargled.\n\nNow, let's combine the information. If the flugel is not zargled (as stated in statement 2), then it must be blimmed (as stated in statement 1). This is because the only other option is that it must be zargled, but we know that's not the case.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
