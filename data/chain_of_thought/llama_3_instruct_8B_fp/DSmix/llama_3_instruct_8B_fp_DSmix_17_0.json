The flob might not be movated.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the flob is either skizzled or movated. From statement 2, we know that the flob might not be movated. This implies that the flob is not necessarily movated.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If the flob is skizzled, then it must be skizzled (since it's either skizzled or movated).\n* If the flob is not skizzled, then it must be movated (since it's either skizzled or movated). But we know that the flob might not be movated, so this possibility is ruled out.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude that the flob is indeed skizzled. If it were not skizzled, it would have to be movated, but we know that's not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
