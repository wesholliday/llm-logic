The smonk might not be plagged\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the smonk is either vreebled or plagged. From statement 2, we know that the smonk might not be plagged. This implies that the smonk is not plagged.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If the smonk is not plagged, then it must be vreebled (from statement 1).\n* If the smonk is plagged, then statement 2 would be false, which is not possible.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the smonk is indeed vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
