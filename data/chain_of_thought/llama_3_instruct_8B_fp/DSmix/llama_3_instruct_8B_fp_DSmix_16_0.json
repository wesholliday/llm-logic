The sneg might not be sproted\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the sneg is either crampled or it must be sproted. This implies that the sneg is not both crampled and sproted at the same time.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the sneg might not be sproted. This implies that there is a possibility that the sneg is not sproted.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If the sneg is crampled, then it cannot be sproted (since it's either crampled or sproted, but not both).\n* If the sneg is not crampled, then it might be sproted (since it's not crampled, but it might be sproted).\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can conclude that the sneg is indeed crampled. If it were not crampled, then it would be possible for it to be sproted, which contradicts statement 2.\n\nAnswer: yes",
