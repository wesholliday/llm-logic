The sprocket might not be daggled.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the sprocket is either cranked or it must be daggled. This implies that the sprocket is either cranked or it has the possibility of being daggled.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the sprocket might not be daggled. This implies that the possibility of the sprocket being daggled is not certain.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that the sprocket is not necessarily daggled. However, we cannot conclude that the sprocket is cranked. The sprocket might be cranked, but it could also be in some other state.\n\nAnswer: no",
