The smip might not be lupped\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the smip is either shripped or lupped. From statement 2, we know that the smip might not be lupped. This implies that the smip is not lupped.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If the smip is shripped, then it is indeed shripped, and the first statement is satisfied.\n* If the smip is not shripped, then it must be lupped, but we know it's not lupped (from statement 2). This is a contradiction, so the smip cannot be not shripped.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the smip is indeed shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
