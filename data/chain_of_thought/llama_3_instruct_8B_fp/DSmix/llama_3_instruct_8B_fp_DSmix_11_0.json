The flug might not be zimmed.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the flug is either blummed or it must be zimmed. This implies that the flug is not both blummed and not zimmed at the same time.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the flug might not be zimmed. This implies that there is a possibility that the flug is not zimmed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If the flug is not blummed, then it must be zimmed (from statement 1). But this contradicts statement 2, which says that the flug might not be zimmed.\n* Therefore, the only possibility is that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
