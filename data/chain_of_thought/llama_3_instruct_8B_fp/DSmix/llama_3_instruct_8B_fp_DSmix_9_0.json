The twonk might not be plinked.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the twonk is either varnished or it must be plinked. This implies that the twonk is either varnished or it has the possibility of being plinked.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the twonk might not be plinked. This implies that the possibility of the twonk being plinked is not certain.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. If the twonk is not plinked, then it must be varnished (from statement 1). But we know that the twonk might not be plinked (from statement 2). Therefore, we can conclude that the twonk is indeed varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
