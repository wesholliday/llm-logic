We need to analyze these statements to see if we can infer that \"The smonk is vreebled\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the possibility of the smonk being plagged is not certain, as it \"might not\" be plagged. This leaves open the possibility that the smonk is not plagged.\n\nThe second statement presents a dichotomy: either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled. This means that if the smonk is not plagged (as suggested by the first statement), then it must be vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
