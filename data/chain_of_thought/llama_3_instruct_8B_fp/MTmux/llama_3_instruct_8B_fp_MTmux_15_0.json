It's not the case that the dreb must have been spened.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the dreb was vroombed, then it must have been spened. This is a conditional statement, and the antecedent is \"the dreb was vroombed\". \n\nFrom statement 2, we know that it's not the case that the dreb must have been spened. This is a negation of the consequent of the conditional statement in statement 1.\n\nNow, we can use the principle of contrapositive to infer that if the dreb was not spened, then it was not vroombed. This is because if the dreb was not spened, then the antecedent of the conditional statement in statement 1 is not true, and therefore the consequent is also not true.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer that the dreb was not vroombed from the given statements. We can only infer that if the dreb was not spened, then it was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: no",
