It's not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint. This is a conditional statement, and the antecedent is \"the smip was shripped\". \n\nFrom the second statement, we know that it's not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint. This implies that the smip did not lup the zoint.\n\nNow, if the smip did not lup the zoint, then it's possible that the smip was not shripped. This is because the first statement only says that if the smip was shripped, then it must have lupped the zoint. It does not say that if the smip did not lup the zoint, then it was not shripped.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the smip was not shripped. We can only say that the smip did not lup the zoint.\n\nAnswer: no",
