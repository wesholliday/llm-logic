It's not the case that the smonk must have plagged.\n\nWe can start by analyzing the first statement. It's a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the smonk was vreebled) is true, then the consequent (the smonk must have plagged) must also be true. This implies that if the smonk was vreebled, then plagging is a necessary condition for the smonk being vreebled.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement. It says that it's not the case that the smonk must have plagged. This means that plagging is not a necessary condition for the smonk being vreebled.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that the smonk being vreebled does not necessarily imply plagging. This means that the smonk could have been vreebled without plagging.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the smonk was not vreebled. The original statements do not provide enough information to conclude that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: no",
