This is a conditional statement, and the antecedent is \"the flug was blummed\". \n\nThe second statement says that it's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed. This is a negation of the conclusion of the first statement. \n\nFrom this, we can infer that the flug was not blummed. If the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed, but it's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed. Therefore, the flug was not blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
