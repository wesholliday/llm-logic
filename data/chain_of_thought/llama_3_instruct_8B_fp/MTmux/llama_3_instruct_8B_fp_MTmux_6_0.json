It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink.\n\nWe can start by analyzing the first statement. It's a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the grommet was sploffed) is true, then the consequent (the grommet must have plopped the frink) must also be true. This implies that if the grommet was sploffed, then it must have plopped the frink.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement. It's a negation of the consequent of the first statement. This means that the grommet must not have plopped the frink.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that the grommet was not sploffed. If the grommet was sploffed, then it must have plopped the frink, but since it's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink, the grommet cannot have been sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
