It's not the case that the shank must have been nugged.\n\nWe can start by analyzing the first statement, which is a conditional statement. It says that if the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged. This implies that plooking the shank is a sufficient condition for the shank to be nugged.\n\nThe second statement says that it's not the case that the shank must have been nugged. This can be interpreted as saying that the shank not being nugged is possible.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n* If the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged (by statement 1). But we know that it's not the case that the shank must have been nugged (by statement 2). This means that the shank cannot have been plooked, because if it was, it would have to be nugged, but it's not.\n* If the shank was not plooked, then it's possible that it's not nugged (by statement 2). In this case, we can conclude that the shank was not plooked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shank was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
