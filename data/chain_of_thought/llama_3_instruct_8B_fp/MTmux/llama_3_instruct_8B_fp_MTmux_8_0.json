It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled.\n\nWe can start by analyzing the first statement. It's a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the sprocket was cranked) is true, then the consequent (the sprocket must have been daggled) must also be true. However, the second statement tells us that it's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled. This means that the consequent of the first statement is actually false.\n\nNow, we can use the principle of contrapositive to infer that if the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false. In other words, if the sprocket was not daggled, then it was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
