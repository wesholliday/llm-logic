It's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled.\n\nWe can start by analyzing the first statement. It's a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the flugel was blimmed) is true, then the consequent (the flugel must have been zargled) must also be true. This implies that if the flugel was blimmed, then it must have been zargled.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement. It says that it's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled. This means that the flugel must not have been zargled.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the flugel was blimmed, then it must have been zargled. But from the second statement, we know that the flugel must not have been zargled. This creates a contradiction, as we have two statements that cannot both be true.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the first statement is false, which means that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
