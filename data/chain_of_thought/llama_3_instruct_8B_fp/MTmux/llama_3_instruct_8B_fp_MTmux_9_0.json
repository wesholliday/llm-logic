It's not the case that the twonk must have been varnished.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished. This is a conditional statement, and it does not provide any information about the twonk's plinking status if it was not varnished.\n\nStatement 2 says that it's not the case that the twonk must have been varnished. This means that the twonk's being varnished is not a necessary condition. However, this statement does not provide any information about the twonk's plinking status.\n\nFrom these statements, we cannot directly infer that the twonk was not plinked. We can only conclude that the twonk's being varnished is not a necessary condition, but we still don't know whether the twonk was plinked or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
