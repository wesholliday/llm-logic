            "content": "Explanation: \n\nThe given argument is an argument by contrapositive. The original statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked\" can be rewritten as \"If the splat was not quanked, then it was not morphed\". This is because the contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\".\n\nThe second statement \"It's not the case that the splat must have quanked\" can be rewritten as \"The splat may or may not have quanked\".\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the splat may or may not have quanked. This means that the possibility of the splat not being quanked is not ruled out.\n\nNow, if we apply the contrapositive of the original statement to this situation, we get \"If the splat was not quanked, then it was not morphed\". Since the possibility of the splat not being quanked is not ruled out, it is possible that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
