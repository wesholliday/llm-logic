            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The event must have been formal\" provides information about the level of formality of the event, but it does not specify the type of formality. Formal events can range from business meetings to weddings, and the level of formality can vary greatly. The term \"formal\" does not necessarily imply a specific type of formality, such as black-tie. Therefore, we cannot infer that the event must have been formal or black-tie.\n\nAnswer: no",
