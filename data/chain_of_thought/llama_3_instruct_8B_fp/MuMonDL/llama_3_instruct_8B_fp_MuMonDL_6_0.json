            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The concert must have been sold out\" implies that all available tickets were purchased, leaving no tickets remaining. However, it does not provide information about the initial number of tickets available. It is possible that the concert had limited tickets to begin with, but it is also possible that it had a large number of tickets available and they were all sold out.
