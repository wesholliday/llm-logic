However, it does not explicitly rule out the possibility that the movie had subtitles in other languages. To infer that the movie must have had English subtitles, we would need additional information or context that suggests the movie was not entirely in English. Without such information, we cannot conclude that the movie had English subtitles.\n\nAnswer: no",
