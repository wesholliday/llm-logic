We want to know if we can infer that \"The doll was not plastic\".\n\nFrom the second statement, we can deduce that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. However, this does not provide any information about the doll's material if the truck is not metal. The first statement only tells us that the truck might not be metal, but it does not provide any information about the doll.\n\nSince we cannot conclude anything about the doll's material from the given statements, we cannot infer that \"The doll was not plastic\". We need more information to make a conclusion about the doll's material.\n\nAnswer: no",
