We want to know if we can infer that \"Sam did not take a plane\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Erin's taking a train is not certain, but it's possible. From the second statement, we know that if Sam took a plane, Erin would have taken a train. This implies that if Sam didn't take a plane, Erin might not have taken a train (since Erin might not have taken a train in the first place).\n\nHowever, we cannot directly conclude that Sam did not take a plane. The statements only provide information about Erin's actions, not Sam's. We don't have any direct evidence that Sam took a plane or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
