We want to know if we can infer that \"The vampire was not awake\".\n\nFrom the second statement, we can deduce that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake. This implies that the vampire's wakefulness is a sufficient condition for the mummy's wakefulness.\n\nThe first statement tells us that the mummy might not have been awake. This means that there is a possibility that the mummy was not awake.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly conclude that the vampire was not awake from these statements. The statements only provide information about the mummy's wakefulness, not the vampire's.\n\nWe can't say for certain whether the vampire was awake or not, as there is no direct evidence or logical connection between the mummy's wakefulness and the vampire's wakefulness.\n\nAnswer: no",
