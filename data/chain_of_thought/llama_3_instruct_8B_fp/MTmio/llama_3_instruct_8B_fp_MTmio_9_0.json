            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\" and \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\". We want to know if we can infer \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\".\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This implies that Lisa buying the red shirt is a sufficient condition for Mark buying the blue shirt.\n\nHowever, the first statement \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\" suggests that Mark's buying the blue shirt is not certain. This means that there is a possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that Lisa bought the red shirt. If she did, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt (according to the second statement). But we know that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt (according to the first statement). This creates a contradiction, as we cannot simultaneously have both Mark buying the blue shirt and Mark not buying the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. If she had, Mark would have had to buy the blue shirt, which is not possible given the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
