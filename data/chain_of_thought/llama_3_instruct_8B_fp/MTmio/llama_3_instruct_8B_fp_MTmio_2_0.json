We want to know if we can infer that \"The griffin was not in the forest\".\n\nFrom the second statement, we can deduce that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest. This implies that the presence of the griffin is a sufficient condition for the presence of the unicorn.\n\nHowever, the first statement only tells us that the unicorn might not be in the forest, but it doesn't provide any information about the griffin. We can't conclude that the griffin is not in the forest just because the unicorn might not be.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The griffin was not in the forest\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
