From the first statement, we know that Sue's presence at the wedding is uncertain. From the second statement, we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue's presence is guaranteed. However, this does not provide any information about Mary's presence at the wedding. We cannot conclude that Mary was not at the wedding because we don't have any information about her presence.\n\nAnswer: no",
