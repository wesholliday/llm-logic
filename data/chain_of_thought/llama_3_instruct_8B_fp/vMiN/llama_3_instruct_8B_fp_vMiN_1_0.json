            "content": "Explanation: The argument is attempting to use the premise \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" to conclude that \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\". The conclusion is saying that Mary's presence at the wedding is not necessary, which is a negation of the idea that Mary must have been there.\n\nThe argument is using the possibility of Mary not being at the wedding to conclude that it's not necessary for her to be there. This is a valid form of argument, as it's using the possibility of the opposite to conclude that the necessity is not true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
