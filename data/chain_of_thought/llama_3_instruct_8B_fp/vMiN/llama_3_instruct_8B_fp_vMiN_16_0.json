The premise states that the pen might not be in my bag, which implies that there is a possibility that the pen is not in my bag. The conclusion then logically follows from the premise, as it's not the case that the pen must be in my bag if there is a possibility that it's not. The argument is using the concept of possibility to negate the idea of necessity.\n\nAnswer: yes",
