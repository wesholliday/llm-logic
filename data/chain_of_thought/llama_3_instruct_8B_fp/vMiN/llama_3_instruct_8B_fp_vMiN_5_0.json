The premise \"Jeff might not have played basketball\" suggests that there is a possibility that Jeff didn't play basketball. This possibility is consistent with the conclusion that it's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball. The conclusion logically follows from the premise, as the premise provides evidence that supports the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
