The premise states that the toy might not be in the toy box, which implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not in the toy box. The conclusion then logically follows that it's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box, because if it might not be in the toy box, then it's not necessarily in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
