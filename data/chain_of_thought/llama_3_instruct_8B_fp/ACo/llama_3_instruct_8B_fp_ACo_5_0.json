However, this does not provide any information about Jeff's activity. Statement 2 is a conditional statement, which means that it only provides information about the relationship between Jeff's activity and Amy's activity if the condition is met.\n\nThe condition is \"Jeff played basketball\", and the consequence is \"Amy played tennis\". This means that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. However, this does not mean that Jeff played basketball. We cannot infer that Jeff played basketball just because Amy played tennis.\n\nAnswer: no",
