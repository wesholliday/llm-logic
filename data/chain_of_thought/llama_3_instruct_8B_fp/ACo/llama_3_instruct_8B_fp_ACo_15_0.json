If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\n\nFrom statement 2, we can infer that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. However, this does not provide any information about whether Sam actually took a plane or not. We only know that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train, but we don't know the condition that Sam took a plane.\n\nStatement 1, Erin took a train, does not provide any information about Sam's mode of transportation. It only tells us that Erin took a train.\n\nSince we don't have any additional information that links Erin's mode of transportation to Sam's, we cannot infer that Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: no",
