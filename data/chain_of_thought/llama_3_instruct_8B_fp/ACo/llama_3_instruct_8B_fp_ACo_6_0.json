If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\n\nFrom statement 2, we can infer that Bob chose pasta only if Sue chose pizza. However, statement 1 only tells us that Bob chose pasta, but it doesn't provide any information about Sue's choice.\n\nWe can't conclude that Sue chose pizza because there might be other reasons why Bob chose pasta, not just because Sue chose pizza. For example, Bob might have chosen pasta because he likes it, regardless of Sue's choice.\n\nWe need more information to determine Sue's choice. The given statements are not sufficient to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
