However, this does not mean that the antecedent is true. The robot's visit to Jupiter could be due to some other reason, not necessarily related to the alien's visit to Mars.\n\nWe cannot infer the alien's visit to Mars from the given statements. We only know that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter, but we don't know if the alien actually visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: no",
