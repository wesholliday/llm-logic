The conditional statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" implies that if Joe went to the park, Lucy went to the zoo. The fact \"Lucy went to the zoo\" does not provide any information about Joe's actions. We cannot directly conclude that Joe went to the park because we don't know if the condition in the conditional statement was met. We only know that Lucy went to the zoo, but we don't know why.\n\nAnswer: no",
