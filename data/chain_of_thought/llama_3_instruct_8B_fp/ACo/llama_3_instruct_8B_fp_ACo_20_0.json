If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means it's saying that if a certain condition is met (the apple is red), then a certain consequence will follow (the banana is yellow). However, the condition is not met in this case, as we don't have any information about the apple's color.\n\nThe first statement tells us that the banana is yellow, but it doesn't provide any information about the apple's color. Therefore, we cannot infer the apple's color from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
