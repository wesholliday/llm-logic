The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it only provides information about the relationship between the book being written by James and the book being a mystery novel. It does not provide direct information about who wrote the book.\n\nThe first statement, \"The book is a mystery novel\", provides direct information about the book's genre. However, it does not provide any information about who wrote the book.\n\nTo infer that \"The book was written by James\", we would need additional information that connects the book's genre to James' authorship. The given statements do not provide that connection.\n\nAnswer: no",
