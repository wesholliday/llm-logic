If the car was red, then the truck was blue\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means it's saying that if a certain condition is met (the car being red), then a certain consequence will follow (the truck being blue). However, the condition is not met in this case, as we don't have any information about the car's color.\n\nThe first statement tells us that the truck is blue, but it doesn't provide any information about the car's color. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the car's color, including whether it's red or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
