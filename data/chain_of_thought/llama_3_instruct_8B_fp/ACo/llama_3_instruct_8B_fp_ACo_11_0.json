The condition is that the cake is chocolate. The statement does not provide any information about the cake's flavor if it is not chocolate.\n\nThe first statement, \"The muffins were blueberry\", provides information about the muffins' flavor, but it does not provide any information about the cake's flavor.\n\nSince the second statement only provides information about the relationship between the cake and the muffins under the condition that the cake is chocolate, and the first statement does not provide any information about the cake's flavor, we cannot infer the cake's flavor from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
