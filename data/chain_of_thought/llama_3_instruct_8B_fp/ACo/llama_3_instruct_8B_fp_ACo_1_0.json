If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\n\nThe second statement is an implication, which means that if the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequent (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true. However, the implication does not guarantee that the antecedent is true.\n\nThe first statement, \"Sue was at the wedding\", provides additional information that Sue was indeed at the wedding. But it does not provide any information about Mary's presence at the wedding.\n\nFrom the given statements, we cannot directly infer that Mary was at the wedding. We only know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding, but we don't know if Mary was actually at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
