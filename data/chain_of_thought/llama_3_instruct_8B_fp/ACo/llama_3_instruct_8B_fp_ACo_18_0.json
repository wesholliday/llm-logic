However, the condition is not met in this case, as we don't have any information about the doll being plastic.\n\nThe first statement only tells us that the truck is metal, but it doesn't provide any information about the doll. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the doll's material from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
