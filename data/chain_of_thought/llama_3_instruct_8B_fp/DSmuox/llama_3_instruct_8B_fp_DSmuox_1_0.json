We want to know if we can infer that \"The flugel is blimmed\".\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled. Since the first statement says that it's not the case that the flugel must be zargled, we can conclude that the flugel is blimmed. This is because the only other option is that the flugel must be zargled, but we know that's not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
