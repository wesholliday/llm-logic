We want to know if we can infer that \"The flug is blummed\".\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed. Since the first statement says that it's not the case that the flug must be zimmed, we can conclude that the flug is blummed. This is because the only other option is that the flug must be zimmed, which is ruled out.\n\nAnswer: yes",
