We want to know if we can infer that \"The sneg is crampled\".\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that either the sneg is crampled or it must be sproted. Since the first statement says that it's not the case that the sneg must be sproted, we can conclude that the sneg is crampled. This is because if it's not the case that the sneg must be sproted, then it must be crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
