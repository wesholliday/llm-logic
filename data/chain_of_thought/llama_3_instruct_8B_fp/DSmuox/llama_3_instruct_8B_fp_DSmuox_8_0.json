We want to know if we can infer that \"The sprocket is cranked\".\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled. But the first statement tells us that it's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled. This means that the sprocket cannot be daggled, and therefore, it must be cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
