We want to know if we can infer that \"The wug is flooped\".\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that either the wug is flooped or it must be bimmed. Since the first statement says that it's not the case that the wug must be bimmed, we can conclude that the wug is flooped. This is because if it's not the case that the wug must be bimmed, then it must be flooped, according to the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
