We want to know if we can infer that \"The smonk is vreebled\".\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged. The first statement tells us that it's not the case that the smonk must be plagged. Therefore, we can conclude that the smonk is vreebled, since it can't be plagged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
