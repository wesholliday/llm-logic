We want to know if we can infer that \"The splat is morphed\".\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked. This is an either-or situation, which means that if the splat is not morphed, then it must be quanked. But we are told that \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked\", which means that the splat cannot be quanked.\n\nTherefore, since the splat cannot be quanked, it must be morphed. This is because the only other option is that the splat must be quanked, but we know that's not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
