We want to know if we can infer that \"The shank is plooked\".\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged. This means that the shank is either plooked or it is not plooked but must be nugged. \n\nFrom the first statement, we know that it's not the case that the shank must be nugged. This means that the shank is not plooked (because if it were plooked, it would not have to be nugged).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
