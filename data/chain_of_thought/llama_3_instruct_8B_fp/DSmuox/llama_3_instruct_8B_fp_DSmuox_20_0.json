We want to know if we can infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered\".\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned. Since the first statement says that it's not the case that the fleeg must be surned, we can conclude that the fleeg is bluttered. This is because the only other option is that the fleeg must be surned, which is ruled out.\n\nAnswer: yes",
