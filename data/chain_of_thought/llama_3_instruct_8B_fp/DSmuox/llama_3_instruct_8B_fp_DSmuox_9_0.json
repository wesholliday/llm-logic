We want to know if we can infer that \"The twonk is varnished\".\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked. This means that if the twonk is not varnished, then it must be plinked. But the first statement says that it's not the case that the twonk must be plinked. Therefore, we can conclude that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
