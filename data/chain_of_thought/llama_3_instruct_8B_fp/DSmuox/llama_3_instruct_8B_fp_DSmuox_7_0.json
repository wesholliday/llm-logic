We can start by analyzing the second statement, which is a disjunction (either/or) statement. This means that one of the two options must be true. If the whiffle is not shanked, then it must be tinked, according to the second statement. However, we know that it's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked, according to the first statement. This means that the first option in the disjunction, \"the whiffle is shanked\", must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
