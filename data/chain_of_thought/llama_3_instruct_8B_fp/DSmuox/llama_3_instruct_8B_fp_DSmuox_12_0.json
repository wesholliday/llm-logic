We want to know if we can infer that \"The smip is shripped\".\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped. Since the first statement says that it's not the case that the smip must be lupped, we can conclude that the smip is shripped. This is because if it's not the case that the smip must be lupped, then it must be shripped, as the only other option is that it must be lupped, which is ruled out.\n\nAnswer: yes",
