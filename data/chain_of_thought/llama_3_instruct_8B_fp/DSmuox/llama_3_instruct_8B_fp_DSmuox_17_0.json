We want to know if we can infer that \"The flob is skizzled\".\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated. This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the options must be true.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that it's not the case that the flob must be movated. This means that the second option in the disjunction (\"it must be movated\") is not true.\n\nSince the second option is not true, the only remaining option is that the flob is skizzled. Therefore, we can infer that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
