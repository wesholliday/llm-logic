We want to know if we can infer that \"The dreb is vroombed\".\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened. This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the options must be true.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that it's not the case that the dreb must be spened. This means that the second option in the disjunction (\"it must be spened\") is not true.\n\nSince the second option is not true, the only remaining option is that the dreb is vroombed. Therefore, we can infer that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
