We want to know if we can infer that \"The fribble is snurgled\".\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked. Since the first statement says \"It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked\", we can conclude that the fribble is snurgled. This is because the only other option, \"it must be crinked\", is ruled out.\n\nAnswer: yes",
