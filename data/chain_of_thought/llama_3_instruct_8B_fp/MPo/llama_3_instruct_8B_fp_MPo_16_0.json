The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that it only provides information about the pants if the condition (the shirt being cotton) is true. We are also given that the condition is indeed true, since the shirt is cotton. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement to the situation and conclude that the pants were denim.\n\nAnswer: yes",
