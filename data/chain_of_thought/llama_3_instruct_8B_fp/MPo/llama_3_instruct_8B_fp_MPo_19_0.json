            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"Tom watched football\" and \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\". The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that it only implies the conclusion \"Jen watched basketball\" if the antecedent \"Tom watched football\" is true. We are also given the fact that \"Tom watched football\" is indeed true. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement to this specific situation and conclude that \"Jen watched basketball\" is likely to be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
