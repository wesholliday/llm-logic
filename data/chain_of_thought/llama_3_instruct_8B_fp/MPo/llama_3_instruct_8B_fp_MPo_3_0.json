            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"The book was written by James\" and \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\". The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that it states that if a certain condition is met, then a certain consequence follows. In this case, the condition is \"the book was written by James\" and the consequence is \"the book is a mystery novel\". The first statement \"The book was written by James\" is a fact, which means that it is a true statement.\n\nSince the first statement is true, we can apply the conditional statement to it. This means that we can conclude that the book is a mystery novel, because the condition \"the book was written by James\" is met. Therefore, we can infer that the book is a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: yes",
