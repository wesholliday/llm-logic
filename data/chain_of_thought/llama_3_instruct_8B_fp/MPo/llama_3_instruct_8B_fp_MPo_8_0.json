The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that it states that if a certain condition is met (in this case, the vampire being awake), then a certain consequence will follow (in this case, the mummy being awake). The first statement \"The vampire was awake\" is the condition that is met. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement to the situation and conclude that the consequence follows. In this case, the consequence is \"The mummy was awake\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
