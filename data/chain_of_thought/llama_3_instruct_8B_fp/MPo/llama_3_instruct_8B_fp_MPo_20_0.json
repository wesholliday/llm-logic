            "content": "Explanation: We have two statements: \"The apple was red\" and \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\". The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it states that if a certain condition is met (in this case, the apple being red), then a certain consequence follows (in this case, the banana being yellow). The first statement, \"The apple was red\", is a factual statement that provides the condition mentioned in the second statement.\n\nSince the condition (the apple being red) is met, we can apply the conditional statement to infer the consequence. Therefore, we can conclude that the banana was yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
