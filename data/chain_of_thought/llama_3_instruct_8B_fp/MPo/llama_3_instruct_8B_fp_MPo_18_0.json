            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"The doll was plastic\" and \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\". The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that it states that if a certain condition is met (in this case, the doll being plastic), then a certain consequence will follow (in this case, the truck being metal). The first statement \"The doll was plastic\" is the condition that is met, so we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that the consequence follows. Therefore, we can infer that the truck was metal.\n\nAnswer: yes",
