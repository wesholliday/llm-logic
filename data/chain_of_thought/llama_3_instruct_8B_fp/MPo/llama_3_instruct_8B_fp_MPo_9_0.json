            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\". The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that it states that if a certain condition is met (in this case, Lisa buying the red shirt), then a certain consequence will follow (in this case, Mark buying the blue shirt). The first statement \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is the condition that is met. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement to the situation and conclude that the consequence will also be true. In this case, the consequence is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
