            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\". The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that it only implies the truth of the conclusion (\"Sue was at the wedding\") if the antecedent (\"Mary was at the wedding\") is true. We are also given the fact that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is indeed true. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement to this fact and conclude that \"Sue was at the wedding\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
