            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical inference using modus ponens. Modus ponens is a rule of inference that states: \"If A \u2192 B and A, then B\". In this case, \"A\" is \"Sam took a plane\" and \"B\" is \"Erin took a train\". We have two statements: \"Sam took a plane\" (A) and \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" (A \u2192 B). We can apply modus ponens to conclude that \"Erin took a train\" (B) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
