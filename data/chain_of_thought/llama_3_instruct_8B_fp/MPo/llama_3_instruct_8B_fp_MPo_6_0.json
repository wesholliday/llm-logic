The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that it only implies the conclusion \"Bob chose pasta\" if the antecedent \"Sue chose pizza\" is true. Since we know that \"Sue chose pizza\" is indeed true, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that \"Bob chose pasta\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
