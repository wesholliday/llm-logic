            "content": "Explanation: The argument is an example of a conditional argument, where the conclusion is derived from the premise. The premise states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. This can be represented as:\n\nIf C (cake is chocolate) then M (muffins are blueberry)\n\nThe conclusion states that if the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate. This can be represented as:\n\nIf M (muffins are blueberry) then C (cake is chocolate)\n\nThe question is whether this form of argument is logically valid. To determine this, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logical validity.\n\nThe argument is an example of a contrapositive argument, where the conclusion is derived by taking the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of the original premise is:\n\nIf M (muffins are not blueberry) then C (cake is not chocolate)\n\nThis is equivalent to the original conclusion. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because it follows the rules of logical validity, specifically the rule that states that if the premise is true, then the conclusion is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
