            "content": "Explanation: The argument is an example of a conditional argument, where the conclusion is derived from the premise using the same conditional structure. The premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. The conclusion attempts to reverse this relationship, stating that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was also at the wedding. To determine the validity of this argument, we need to examine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nThe key issue here is that the conclusion is attempting to reverse the conditional relationship established in the premise. The premise does not provide any information about the relationship between Mary and Sue's presence at the wedding beyond the specific condition stated. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
