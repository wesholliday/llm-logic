            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" and \"The fleeg did not surn\". We can start by analyzing the first statement, which is a conditional statement. It states that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned. This implies that being bluttered is a necessary condition for something to surn. \n\nNow, let's look at the second statement, \"The fleeg did not surn\". This statement tells us that the fleeg did not surn. \n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that the fleeg was not bluttered. This is because if the fleeg was bluttered, it would have surned, but since it did not surn, it must not have been bluttered. \n\nAnswer: yes",
