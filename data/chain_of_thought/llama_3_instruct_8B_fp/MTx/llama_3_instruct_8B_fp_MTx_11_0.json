We need to determine if we can infer \"The flug was not blummed\" from these statements.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the flug was blummed, then it was also zimmed. This implies that being blummed is a sufficient condition for being zimmed.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the flug was not zimmed. This means that the flug cannot be blummed, because if it were, it would also be zimmed, which is not the case.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the flug was not blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
