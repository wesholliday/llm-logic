The flob did not movated.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the flob was skizzled, then it movated. This is a conditional statement, and the antecedent (the condition) is \"the flob was skizzled\". The consequent (the result) is \"the flob movated\".\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the flob did not movate. This is a direct statement about the flob's movement.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. If the flob was skizzled, then it would movate (according to statement 1). But the flob did not movate (according to statement 2). This means that the flob was not skizzled, because if it was, it would have movated.\n\nAnswer: yes",
