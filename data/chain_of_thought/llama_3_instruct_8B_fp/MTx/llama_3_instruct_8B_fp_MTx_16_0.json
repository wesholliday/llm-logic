The sneg did not sproted the frink\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the sneg was crampled, then it sproted the frink. This is a conditional statement, and the antecedent (the sneg was crampled) is not necessarily true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the sneg did not sproted the frink.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. If the sneg was crampled, then it would have sproted the frink (according to statement 1). But we know that the sneg did not sproted the frink (according to statement 2). Therefore, it is not possible for the sneg to have been crampled, because if it was, it would have sproted the frink, but it didn't.\n\nAnswer: yes",
