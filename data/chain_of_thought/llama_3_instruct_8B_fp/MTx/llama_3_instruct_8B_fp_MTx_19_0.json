The smonk did not plagged\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the smonk was vreebled, then it plagged. This is a conditional statement, and the antecedent (the condition) is \"the smonk was vreebled\". The consequent (the result) is \"the smonk plagged\".\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the smonk did not plagged.\n\nNow, we want to infer whether the smonk was vreebled or not. We can do this by using the conditional statement from statement 1. Since the smonk did not plagged (from statement 2), we can conclude that the smonk was not vreebled. This is because if the smonk was vreebled, then it would plagged (from statement 1), but it didn't plagged (from statement 2), so it must not have been vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
