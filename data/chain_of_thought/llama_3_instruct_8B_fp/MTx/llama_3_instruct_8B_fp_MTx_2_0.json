We want to infer whether \"The wug was not flooped\" is true or not.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can conclude that if the wug was flooped, then it bimmed the zoint. This implies that bimming the zoint is a consequence of the wug being flooped.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the wug did not bim the zoint. This means that the wug not bimming the zoint is a fact.\n\nNow, if the wug was flooped, then it would have bimmed the zoint, but since it didn't, it must not have been flooped. This is because the consequence of being flooped (bimming the zoint) did not occur.\n\nAnswer: yes",
