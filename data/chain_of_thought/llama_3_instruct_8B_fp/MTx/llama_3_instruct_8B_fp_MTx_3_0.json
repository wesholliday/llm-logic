The splat did not quank.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the splat was morphed, then it quanked. This is a conditional statement, and the antecedent (the splat being morphed) is not necessarily true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the splat did not quank.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation: if the splat was morphed, then it would quank (from statement 1). But the splat did not quank (from statement 2). Therefore, the splat cannot be morphed, because if it were, it would quank, but it didn't.\n\nAnswer: yes",
