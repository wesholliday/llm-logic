The whiffle did not tink.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the whiffle was shanked, then it tinked. This is a conditional statement, and the antecedent (the whiffle being shanked) is not necessarily true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the whiffle did not tink. This is a direct statement about the whiffle's tinking.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. If the whiffle was shanked, then it tinked (from statement 1). But the whiffle did not tink (from statement 2). This means that the whiffle cannot be shanked, because if it was, it would tink, but it didn't.\n\nAnswer: yes",
