We want to know if we can infer that \"The dreb was not vroombed\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was also spened. This implies that being vroombed is a sufficient condition for being spened.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the dreb was not spened. This means that the dreb cannot be spened.\n\nNow, if the dreb cannot be spened, it means that it was not vroombed, because being vroombed is a sufficient condition for being spened. Therefore, we can infer that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
