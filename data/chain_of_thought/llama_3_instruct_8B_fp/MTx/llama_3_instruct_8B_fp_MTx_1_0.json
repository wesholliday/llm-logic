The flugel was not zargled\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the flugel was blimmed, then it must also be zargled. This is a conditional statement, and the antecedent (if the flugel was blimmed) is not necessarily true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the flugel was not zargled.\n\nNow, we want to infer whether the flugel was blimmed or not. Since the flugel was not zargled, it means that the condition in statement 1 (the flugel being blimmed) is not met. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: no",
