The shank was not nugged.\n\nWe can start by analyzing the first statement, which is a conditional statement. It states that if the shank was plooked, then it was also nugged. This implies that plooking and nugging are related in some way, possibly that they are the same thing or that one always leads to the other.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the shank was not nugged. This gives us a fact about the shank, but it doesn't directly relate to plooking.\n\nTo infer that the shank was not plooked, we would need to know that plooking and nugging are mutually exclusive, meaning that if the shank was not nugged, it must also not have been plooked. However, the given statements do not provide this information.\n\nAnswer: no",
