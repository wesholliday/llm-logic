            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\" and \"The twonk was not varnished\". We want to know if we can infer that \"The twonk was not plinked\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished. This implies that plinking the twonk is a sufficient condition for it to be varnished.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the twonk was not varnished. This means that the twonk did not meet the condition of being varnished.\n\nSince the twonk was not varnished, and plinking the twonk is a sufficient condition for it to be varnished, it follows that the twonk was not plinked. If the twonk had been plinked, it would have been varnished, but since it was not varnished, it must not have been plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
