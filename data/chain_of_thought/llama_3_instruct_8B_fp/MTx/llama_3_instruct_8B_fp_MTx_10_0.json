            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" and \"The wug was not garpled\". We can use the first statement to create a conditional statement: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it is true that the wug was garpled\". We can then use the second statement to conclude that the antecedent of the conditional statement (\"the wug was sproinged\") is false, since the wug was not garpled. Therefore, we can infer that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
