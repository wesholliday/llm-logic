            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\" and \"The clug did not snugged\". We want to know if we can infer that \"The clug was not fleeked\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the clug was fleeked, then it snugged. This implies that being fleeked is a sufficient condition for the clug to snugged.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the clug did not snugged. This means that the clug did not snugged, regardless of whether it was fleeked or not.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible scenarios:\n\n* If the clug was fleeked, then it would snugged (from the first statement). But we know it didn't snugged (from the second statement). This means that the clug cannot be fleeked.\n* If the clug was not fleeked, then it wouldn't snugged (from the first statement). And we know it didn't snugged (from the second statement). This means that the clug can indeed be not fleeked.\n\nFrom these scenarios, we can conclude that if the clug did not snugged, then it is not fleeked. Therefore, we can infer that \"The clug was not fleeked\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
