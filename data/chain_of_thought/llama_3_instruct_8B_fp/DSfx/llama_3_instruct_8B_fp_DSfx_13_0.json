We need to use logical deduction to infer whether \"The glip is slogged\" can be concluded.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the glip is either tragged or slogged. From the second statement, we know that the glip is not tragged. Therefore, we can conclude that the glip must be slogged, since it cannot be both tragged and not tragged at the same time.\n\nAnswer: yes",
