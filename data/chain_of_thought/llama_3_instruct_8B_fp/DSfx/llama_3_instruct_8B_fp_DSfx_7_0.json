The first statement is a disjunction, which means it is saying that one of the two options is true. The second statement is a negation, which means it is saying that the first option is false.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the whiffle is not tinked. This means that the first option in the disjunction is false.\n\nSince the first option is false, the second option \"it is shanked\" must be true. Therefore, we can infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
