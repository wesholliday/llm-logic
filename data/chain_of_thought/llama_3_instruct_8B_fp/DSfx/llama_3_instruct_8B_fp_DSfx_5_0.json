From the first statement, we know that the zinger is either smoogled or fraggled, but not both. From the second statement, we know that the zinger is not smoogled. Therefore, we can conclude that the zinger must be fraggled, since it is not smoogled and it is either smoogled or fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
