From the second statement, we know that the wug is not garpled. This means that the first statement's first option, \"the wug is garpled\", is false. Since the first statement is a disjunction (either/or), if the first option is false, the second option must be true. Therefore, we can infer that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
