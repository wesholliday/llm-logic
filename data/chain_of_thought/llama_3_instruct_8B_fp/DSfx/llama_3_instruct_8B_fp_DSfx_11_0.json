From the first statement, we know that the flug is either zimmed or blummed, but we don't know which one. The second statement tells us that the flug is not zimmed. This means that the only possibility left is that the flug is blummed. Therefore, we can infer that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
