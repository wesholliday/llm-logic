We need to determine if we can infer that \"The flugel is blimmed\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the flugel is either zargled or blimmed. From the second statement, we know that the flugel is not zargled. This means that the only possibility left is that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
