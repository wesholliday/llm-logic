This statement is saying that if the meal was prepared, then it was not done with care. This does not imply that if the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared. The original statement is saying that if the meal was prepared, then it was not done with care, but it's not saying that if it was done with care, then it was not prepared.\n\nThe original statement is not logically equivalent to the statement \"If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared\". The original statement is saying that if the meal was prepared, then it was not done with care, but it's not saying that if it was done with care, then it was not prepared. The two statements are not logically equivalent, and we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no",
