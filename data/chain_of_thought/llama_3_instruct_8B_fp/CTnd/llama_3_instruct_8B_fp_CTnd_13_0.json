This means that if Alex exercised, the amount of exercise he did was not much. However, this does not imply that if Alex exercised much, he did not exercise. The original statement only talks about the relationship between exercising and the amount of exercise, not the existence of exercise itself.\n\nThe statement \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise\" is a different conditional statement that is not logically implied by the original statement. To infer this statement, we would need additional information or a different conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
