This statement does not provide any information about the converse, i.e., what happens if the issue was discussed in depth.\n\nThe converse statement \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed\" is trying to infer the opposite, which is not logically supported by the original statement. The original statement only talks about the relationship between \"discussed\" and \"discussed in depth\", but it does not provide any information about the relationship between \"discussed in depth\" and \"discussed\".\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the converse statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
