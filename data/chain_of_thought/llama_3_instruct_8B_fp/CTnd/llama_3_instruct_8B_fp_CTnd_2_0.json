However, this statement does not provide any information about the relationship between Ann exercising strenuously and not exercising. The original statement only tells us that if Ann exercises, she does not exercise strenuously, but it does not make a claim about the opposite scenario.\n\nThe inference \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise\" is attempting to flip the original statement, which is not justified. The original statement does not provide any evidence to support the conclusion that exercising strenuously is equivalent to not exercising.\n\nAnswer: no",
