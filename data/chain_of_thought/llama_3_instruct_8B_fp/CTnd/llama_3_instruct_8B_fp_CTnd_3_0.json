This does not necessarily mean that the converse implication is also true. In other words, just because eating a meal implies not eating a large meal, it does not mean that not eating a large meal implies eating a meal.\n\nThe converse implication would be saying that if I did not eat a large meal, then I must have eaten a meal. However, this is not necessarily true. I could have eaten a small meal, or no meal at all, and still not have eaten a large meal.\n\nAnswer: no",
