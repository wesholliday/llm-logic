            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly\" is a conditional statement that implies that the room was not cleaned thoroughly, but it does not necessarily mean that it was not cleaned at all. The statement is saying that if the room was cleaned, it was not done thoroughly, but it does not provide any information about the opposite scenario, i.e., if the room was cleaned thoroughly.\n\nThe conclusion \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\" is an inverse of the original statement, and it is not logically equivalent. The original statement only provides information about the relationship between \"the room was cleaned\" and \"the room was not cleaned thoroughly\", but it does not provide any information about the relationship between \"the room was cleaned thoroughly\" and \"the room was not cleaned\".\n\nAnswer: no",
