This statement is saying that if a recommendation was made, then it cannot be a strong recommendation. This is a negative correlation between the two events.\n\nTo infer the opposite statement, \"If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made\", we need to apply the same logic. If a strong recommendation was made, then it cannot be the case that a recommendation was made. This is because the original statement says that if a recommendation was made, then it was not a strong recommendation. Therefore, if a strong recommendation was made, then it cannot be a recommendation.\n\nAnswer: yes",
