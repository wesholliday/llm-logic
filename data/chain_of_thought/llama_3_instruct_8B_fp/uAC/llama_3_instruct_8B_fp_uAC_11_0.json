It's saying that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. This is a logical connection, not a physical one. The second statement \"the muffins were blueberry\" is a separate fact that confirms the muffins are indeed blueberry. We can use the first statement to make an inference about the cake, but we need to be careful not to assume a physical connection between the cake and muffins.\n\nAnswer: yes",
