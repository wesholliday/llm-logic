Chris finished the race.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Alex finished the race) is true, then the consequence (Chris finished the race) is also true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Chris finished the race. This is a separate fact that is not related to Alex.\n\nNow, we need to see if we can infer that Alex finished the race. We can do this by using the conditional statement from statement 1. Since we know that Chris finished the race (from statement 2), we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that Alex also finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
