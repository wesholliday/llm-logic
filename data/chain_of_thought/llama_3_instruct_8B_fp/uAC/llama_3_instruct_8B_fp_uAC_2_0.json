The unicorn was in the forest.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is also in the forest. This is a conditional statement, and the condition is that the griffin is in the forest.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the unicorn is indeed in the forest.\n\nNow, we need to see if we can conclude that the griffin is also in the forest. Since the condition in statement 1 is met (the unicorn is in the forest), we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that the griffin is also in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
