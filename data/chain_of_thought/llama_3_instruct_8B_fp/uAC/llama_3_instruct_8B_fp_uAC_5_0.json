Amy played tennis.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This is a conditional statement, and it does not necessarily mean that Jeff played basketball. It only means that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Amy played tennis. This does not provide any information about Jeff's activity.\n\nSince we don't have any additional information about Jeff's activity, we cannot infer that Jeff played basketball. The statements only provide a conditional relationship between Jeff's activity and Amy's activity, but they do not provide any direct evidence about Jeff's activity.\n\nAnswer: no",
