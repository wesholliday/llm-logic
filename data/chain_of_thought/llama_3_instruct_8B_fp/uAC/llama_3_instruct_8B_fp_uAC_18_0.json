The truck was metal.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. But this does not necessarily mean that the doll is plastic. The doll could be something else, and the truck would still be metal.\n\nHowever, statement 2 tells us that the truck is indeed metal. This does not provide any information about the doll. We cannot conclude that the doll is plastic just because the truck is metal.\n\nAnswer: no",
