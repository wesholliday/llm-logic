The banana was yellow.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the banana is indeed yellow. However, this does not directly provide any information about the color of the apple. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means it only provides information about the relationship between the apple's color and the banana's color if the condition is met.\n\nTo infer the color of the apple, we need to know that the condition in the first statement is indeed met. In other words, we need to know that the apple is red. The second statement only tells us that the banana is yellow, but it does not provide any information about the apple's color.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the color of the apple solely based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
