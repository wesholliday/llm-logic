The robot visited Jupiter.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. This is a conditional statement, and it does not necessarily mean that the alien visited Mars. The robot could have visited Jupiter for some other reason.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the robot did visit Jupiter. However, this does not provide any information about the alien's visit to Mars.\n\nSince we cannot conclude that the alien visited Mars based on the robot's visit to Jupiter, we cannot infer that the alien visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: no",
