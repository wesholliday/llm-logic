            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship between the vampire's wakefulness and the mummy's wakefulness. This is a conditional statement, and the \"then\" clause indicates that the mummy's wakefulness is dependent on the vampire's wakefulness.\n\nThe second statement \"the mummy was awake\" provides additional information, but it does not directly relate to the vampire's wakefulness. It only confirms that the mummy was indeed awake.\n\nTo infer that the vampire was awake, we would need to know that the mummy's wakefulness is a direct result of the vampire's wakefulness. However, the original statement only implies a correlation between the two, not a direct cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nAnswer: no",
