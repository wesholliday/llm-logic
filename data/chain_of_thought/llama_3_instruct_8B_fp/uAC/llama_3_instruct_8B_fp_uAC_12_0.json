Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Joe went to the park, Lucy went to the zoo. However, this does not necessarily mean that Joe went to the park. The \"if\" clause in the first statement is a conditional statement, and it does not provide direct evidence that Joe actually went to the park.\n\nThe second statement, \"Lucy went to the zoo\", does not provide any information about Joe's actions. It only confirms that Lucy went to the zoo, which is already implied by the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Joe went to the park based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
