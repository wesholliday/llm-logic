The truck was blue.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the car is red, then the truck is blue. But this does not necessarily mean that the car is red. The truck being blue does not provide any information about the color of the car.\n\nHowever, statement 2 only tells us that the truck is blue, but it does not provide any information about the car. Therefore, we cannot infer the color of the car from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
