However, this does not provide any direct information about Ben's eating habits. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it only provides information about Ben's eating habits if Kate ate salad. Since we already know that Kate ate salad (from statement 2), we can apply the conditional statement to infer that Ben ate pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
