Sue was at the wedding.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. This is a conditional statement, and the condition is that Mary was at the wedding. If the condition is true, then the consequence (Sue was at the wedding) is also true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Sue was indeed at the wedding. This does not provide any information about Mary's presence at the wedding.\n\nTo infer that Mary was at the wedding, we would need to combine the two statements. However, we cannot directly conclude that Mary was at the wedding from the given information. The only thing we can say is that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding, but we don't know if Mary was actually at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
