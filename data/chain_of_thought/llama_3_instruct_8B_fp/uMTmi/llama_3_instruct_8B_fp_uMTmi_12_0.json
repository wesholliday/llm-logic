Lucy might not have gone to the zoo.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can conclude that if Joe went to the park, Lucy went to the zoo. However, this does not provide any information about what happened if Joe did not go to the park. Statement 2 only tells us that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo, but it does not provide any information about Joe's actions.\n\nWe cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park because the statements do not provide any information about Joe's actions if Lucy did not go to the zoo. The statements only provide information about the relationship between Joe's actions and Lucy's actions under certain conditions, but they do not provide any information about the actual actions taken by Joe.\n\nAnswer: no",
