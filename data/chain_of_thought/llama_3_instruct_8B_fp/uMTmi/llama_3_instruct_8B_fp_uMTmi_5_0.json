Amy might not have played tennis.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can conclude that if Jeff played basketball, Amy would have played tennis. However, this does not mean that Amy did not play tennis. Statement 2 suggests that Amy might not have played tennis, which is a possibility.\n\nWe cannot infer that Jeff did not play basketball because the statements do not provide any information about Jeff's actions. The only connection between Jeff and Amy is that if Jeff played basketball, Amy would have played tennis. But we don't know if Jeff actually played basketball or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
