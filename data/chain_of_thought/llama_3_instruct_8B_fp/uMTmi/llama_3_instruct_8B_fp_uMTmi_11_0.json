It suggests that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry. However, the second statement \"the muffins might not have been blueberry\" introduces uncertainty and possibility. This does not necessarily mean that the cake is not chocolate.\n\nThe original conditional statement does not provide any information about the cake's flavor if the muffins are not blueberry. Therefore, we cannot infer that the cake was not chocolate based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
