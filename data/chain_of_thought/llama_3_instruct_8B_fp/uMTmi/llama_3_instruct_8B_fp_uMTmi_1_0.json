Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can conclude that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. However, this does not provide any information about Sue's presence at the wedding when Mary is not present.\n\nStatement 2 only tells us that Sue's presence at the wedding is uncertain, but it does not provide any information about Mary's presence.\n\nSince we have no additional information that would allow us to conclude that Mary was not at the wedding, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
