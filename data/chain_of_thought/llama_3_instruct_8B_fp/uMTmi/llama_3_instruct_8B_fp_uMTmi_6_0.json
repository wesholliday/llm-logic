However, this does not necessarily mean that Sue's choice is the only possible outcome. The statement \"Bob might not have chosen pasta\" suggests that there is a possibility that Bob's choice is independent of Sue's choice.\n\nFrom the given information, we cannot directly infer that Sue did not choose pizza. The only conclusion we can draw is that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta, but this does not provide any information about Sue's choice in the absence of Bob's choice.\n\nAnswer: no",
