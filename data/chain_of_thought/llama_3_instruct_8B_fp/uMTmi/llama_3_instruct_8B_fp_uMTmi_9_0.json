            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" implies a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. This does not provide any information about Lisa not buying the red shirt. The second statement \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\" is a separate statement that does not affect the original conditional relationship. Therefore, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
