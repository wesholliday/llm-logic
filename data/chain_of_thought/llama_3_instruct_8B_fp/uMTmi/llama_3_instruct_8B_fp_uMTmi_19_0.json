            "content": "Explanation: The given statements provide information about Tom and Jen's possible actions, but they do not provide any direct evidence about Tom's action. The first statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\" implies that if Tom watched football, Jen would have watched basketball, but it does not say that Tom watched football. The second statement \"Jen might not have watched basketball\" adds more uncertainty to Jen's action, but it does not provide any information about Tom's action. Therefore, we cannot infer that Tom did not watch football based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
