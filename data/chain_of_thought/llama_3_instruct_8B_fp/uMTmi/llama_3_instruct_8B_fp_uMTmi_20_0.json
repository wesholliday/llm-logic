            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana. However, the second part of the statement \"the banana might not have been yellow\" introduces a possibility that the banana could have been a different color. This possibility does not affect the original conditional statement, which only states that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow.\n\nThe original statement does not provide any information about the color of the apple when the banana is not yellow. Therefore, we cannot infer that the apple was not red based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
