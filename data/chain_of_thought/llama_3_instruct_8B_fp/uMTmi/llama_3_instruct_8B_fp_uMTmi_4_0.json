However, the statement \"the robot might not have visited Jupiter\" introduces uncertainty and possibility, which weakens the original implication.\n\nThe original statement only provides a conditional relationship between the alien's visit to Mars and the robot's visit to Jupiter, but it does not provide any information about the alien's visit to Mars. The statement \"the robot might not have visited Jupiter\" does not provide any information about the alien's visit to Mars either.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the alien did not visit Mars based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
