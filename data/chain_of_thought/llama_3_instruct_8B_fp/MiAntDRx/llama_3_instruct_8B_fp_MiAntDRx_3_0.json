The word \"or\" is a logical operator that indicates that the fribble could be in one of the two locations mentioned. This means that the fribble could be in the blurble, or it could be on the wumble, but it's not necessarily saying that it's on the wumble. The sentence is providing two possible locations for the fribble, but it's not making a specific claim about which one is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
