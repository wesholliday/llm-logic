The key to this problem is to identify the patterns and relationships between the words. In this case, the words \"wibble\", \"wumble\", \"shimble\", and \"blurble\" all seem to be similar in structure and sound, suggesting that they might be interchangeable. The word \"wobble\" appears to be a separate entity, but it's possible that it could be paired with one of the other words to form a new sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
