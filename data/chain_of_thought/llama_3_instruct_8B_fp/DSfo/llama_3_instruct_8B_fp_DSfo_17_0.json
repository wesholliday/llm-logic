The second statement says that either the scarf is draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack. From these two statements, we can infer that the scarf is not draped on the coat rack. However, we cannot directly infer that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack. The second statement only provides two options, but it does not provide any information about which option is true. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: no",
