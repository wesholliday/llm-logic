The first statement tells us that Fido is not in the garden, which means that Fido is either inside or not in the garden. The second statement provides two options: either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside. Since we already know that Fido is not in the garden, we can eliminate the first option and conclude that Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
