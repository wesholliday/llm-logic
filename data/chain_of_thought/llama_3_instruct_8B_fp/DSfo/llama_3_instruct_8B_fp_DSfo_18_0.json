From the first statement, we know that the notebook is not on the nightstand. The second statement is a disjunction, which means it is saying that one of the two options is true. Since we know the first option (the notebook is on the nightstand) is false, we can conclude that the second option (the notebook is in the drawer) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
