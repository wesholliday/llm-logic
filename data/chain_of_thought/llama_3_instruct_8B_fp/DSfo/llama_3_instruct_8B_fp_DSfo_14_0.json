Either the milk is chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the milk is not in the fridge. Statement 2 provides two possibilities: either the milk is in the fridge or it is on the counter. Since we already know that the milk is not in the fridge, we can eliminate the first possibility. This leaves us with only one option, which is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
