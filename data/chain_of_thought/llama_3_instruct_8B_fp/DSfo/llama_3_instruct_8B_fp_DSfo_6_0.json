Either the phone is ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen. However, this does not provide any information about the location of the phone when it is not ringing. The phone could be in the living room, or it could be in some other room or location.\n\nStatement 2 provides two possibilities: either the phone is ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room. However, we are given information that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen (from statement 1), so the first possibility is eliminated. This leaves us with the second possibility: the phone is in the living room.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer with certainty that the phone is in the living room. The second statement only provides a possibility, and we do not have any additional information to confirm that the phone is indeed in the living room.\n\nAnswer: no",
