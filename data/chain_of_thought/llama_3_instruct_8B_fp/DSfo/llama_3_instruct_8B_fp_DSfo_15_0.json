This implies that the shoes are not in the state described in statement 2, which is \"lined up by the door\".\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that there are only two possible states for the shoes: either they are lined up by the door or they are in the closet. Since we have already established that the shoes are not lined up by the door, the only remaining possibility is that they are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
