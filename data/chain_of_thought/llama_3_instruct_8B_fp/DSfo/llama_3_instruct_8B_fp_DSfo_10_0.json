From the first statement, we know that the missing sock is not under the bed. The second statement is a disjunction, which means it's saying that one of the two options is true. Since we know the first option (the missing sock being under the bed) is false, we can conclude that the second option (the missing sock being in the laundry basket) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
