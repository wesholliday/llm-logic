            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements. The first statement \"The book might not be resting on the table\" implies that there is a possibility that the book is not resting on the table. The second statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" implies that if the book is not resting on the table, then it must be on the shelf. This is a disjunction, which means that one of the two options must be true. Since we know that the book might not be resting on the table, we can conclude that the book must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
