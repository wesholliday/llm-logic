From the first statement, we know that the pen's presence on the desk is uncertain, but it's possible that it's not on the desk. The second statement provides two alternatives: either the pen is in the bag or it must be on the desk. Since we know that the pen might not be on the desk, we can conclude that it's more likely that the pen is in the bag, as the alternative \"it must be on my desk\" is already ruled out.\n\nAnswer: yes",
