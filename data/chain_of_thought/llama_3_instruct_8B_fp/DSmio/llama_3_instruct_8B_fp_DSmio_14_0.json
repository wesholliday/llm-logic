The first statement says that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge, which means that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. The second statement says that either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge, which means that the milk is either on the counter or it is in the fridge. \n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that the milk is either on the counter or it is in the fridge. However, we cannot directly conclude that the milk is on the counter. The statement does not rule out the possibility that the milk is in the fridge. \n\nAnswer: no",
