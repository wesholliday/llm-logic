The words \"zizz\", \"frazzle\", and \"flim\" seem to be arbitrary and do not have any established relationships or meanings.\n\nGiven this, it is difficult to infer any additional information or relationships between these words. The phrase does not provide any logical or semantic connections that would allow us to make a conclusion about the presence or absence of the word \"quork\".\n\nAnswer: no",
