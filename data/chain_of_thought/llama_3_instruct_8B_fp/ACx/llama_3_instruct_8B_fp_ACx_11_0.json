The flug was zimmed\n\nWe are trying to infer whether the flug was blummed or not. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the flug was blummed) is true, then the consequent (the flug was zimmed) must also be true. However, the second statement only tells us that the flug was zimmed, but it doesn't provide any information about whether the flug was blummed or not.\n\nSince the second statement doesn't provide any direct evidence about the flug being blummed, we cannot infer that the flug was blummed. The only thing we know is that the flug was zimmed, but we don't know whether it was blummed or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
