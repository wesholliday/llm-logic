Now, we need to see if we can infer that the fleeg was bluttered. Statement 1 is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the fleeg was bluttered) is true, then the consequent (it surned) must also be true.\n\nSince we know that the fleeg surned (from statement 2), we can conclude that the antecedent \"the fleeg was bluttered\" must also be true. This is because the consequent \"it surned\" is true, and the conditional statement says that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
