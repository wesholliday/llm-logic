The sneg sproted the frink\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means it implies that if the antecedent (the sneg was crampled) is true, then the consequent (the sneg sproted the frink) must also be true. However, the second statement only tells us that the sneg sproted the frink, but it doesn't provide any information about whether the sneg was crampled or not.\n\nWe can't infer the antecedent (the sneg was crampled) from the consequent (the sneg sproted the frink) because the consequent could be true for reasons other than the antecedent being true. For example, the sneg might have sproted the frink for some other reason, not because it was crampled.\n\nAnswer: no",
