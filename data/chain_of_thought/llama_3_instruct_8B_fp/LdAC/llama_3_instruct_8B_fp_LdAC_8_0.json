We want to know if we can logically deduce \"The vampire was awake\" from these statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the vampire being awake) is true, then the consequent (the mummy being awake) must also be true. However, this does not mean that the antecedent is true. It only means that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent is also true.\n\nThe second statement, \"The mummy was awake\", tells us that the mummy is indeed awake. But this does not provide any information about the vampire's state.\n\nSince we don't have any additional information about the vampire, we cannot logically deduce that the vampire was awake. The mummy being awake does not necessarily mean that the vampire was also awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
