Kate ate salad\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. This is a conditional statement, and it does not directly imply that Ben ate pasta. It only provides a relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating salad.\n\nStatement 2, \"Kate ate salad\", does not provide any information about Ben's actions. It only confirms that Kate ate salad, which is already implied by statement 1.\n\nSince we do not have any additional information about Ben's actions, we cannot logically deduce that \"Ben ate pasta\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
