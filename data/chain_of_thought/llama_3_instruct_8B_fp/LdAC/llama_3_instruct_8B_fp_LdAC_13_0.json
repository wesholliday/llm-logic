The truck was blue\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. However, this does not mean that the car is actually red. The statement only provides a conditional relationship between the car's color and the truck's color.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the truck is indeed blue, but it does not provide any information about the car's color. We cannot logically conclude that the car is red because the truck is blue. The truck's color being blue only satisfies the condition in statement 1, but it does not guarantee that the car is red.\n\nAnswer: no",
