            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Sue was at the wedding\". The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true. The second statement is a categorical statement, which simply states that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nTo deduce \"Mary was at the wedding\" from these two statements, we need to use the first statement to conclude that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary must have been at the wedding as well. However, we are not given any information that directly links Sue's presence at the wedding to Mary's presence. We only know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding, but we don't know if Sue was at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce \"Mary was at the wedding\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
