            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are a conditional statement and a categorical statement. The conditional statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" implies that if the antecedent (the apple being red) is true, then the consequent (the banana being yellow) must also be true. The categorical statement \"The banana was yellow\" states that the banana is indeed yellow. However, this does not provide any information about the apple's color. The conditional statement only establishes a relationship between the apple's color and the banana's color, but it does not provide a direct link between the apple's color and the fact that the banana is yellow.\n\nThe problem is that the conditional statement is not a direct statement about the apple's color. It's a statement about the relationship between the apple's color and the banana's color. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce the apple's color from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
