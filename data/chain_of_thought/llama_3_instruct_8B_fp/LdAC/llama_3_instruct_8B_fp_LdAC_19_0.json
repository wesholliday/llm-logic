Jen watched basketball\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This is a conditional statement, and it does not directly imply that Tom watched football. It only provides a relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that Jen did indeed watch basketball. However, this does not provide any information about Tom's actions. We cannot conclude that Tom watched football just because Jen watched basketball.\n\nThe only way we could conclude that Tom watched football would be if we had additional information that directly linked Tom's actions to the condition in statement 1. Since we don't have that information, we cannot logically deduce that Tom watched football.\n\nAnswer: no",
