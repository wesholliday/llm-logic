            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are:\n\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\n2. The truck was metal\n\nWe can start by analyzing the first statement, which is an if-then statement. This statement is saying that if the condition \"the doll was plastic\" is true, then the consequence \"the truck was metal\" must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that the condition is true. It only establishes a relationship between the condition and the consequence.\n\nThe second statement, \"The truck was metal\", is a separate statement that provides additional information. It tells us that the truck is indeed metal, but it does not provide any information about the doll.\n\nTo logically deduce \"The doll was plastic\" from the given statements, we would need to know that the condition in the if-then statement is true. However, we do not have any information that confirms or denies the condition. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce \"The doll was plastic\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
