The muffins were blueberry\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the muffins are indeed blueberry. However, this information does not provide any direct evidence about the cake. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it only provides information about the relationship between the cake and the muffins under certain conditions.\n\nThe problem is that we don't know whether the cake is actually chocolate or not. The first statement only tells us that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry. It does not tell us that if the muffins are blueberry, then the cake is chocolate.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce that the cake was chocolate based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
