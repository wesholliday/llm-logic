It's saying that it's not necessary for the flugel to have been blimmed. This doesn't necessarily imply that the flugel might not have been blimmed. The flugel might have been blimmed, but it's not necessary that it was. The statement only rules out the necessity of blimming, not the possibility.\n\nAnswer: no",
