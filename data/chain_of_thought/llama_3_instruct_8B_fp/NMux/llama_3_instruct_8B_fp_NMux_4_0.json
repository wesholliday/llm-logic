It's saying that it's not necessary for the fribble to have been snurgled. This does not necessarily imply that the fribble might not have been snurgled. The fribble might still have been snurgled, but it's not necessary that it was. The statement only rules out the necessity of snurging, not the possibility.\n\nAnswer: no",
