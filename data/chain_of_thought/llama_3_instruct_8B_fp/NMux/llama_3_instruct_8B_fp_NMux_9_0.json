It's saying that it's not necessary for the twonk to have been plinked. This does not necessarily imply that the twonk might not have been plinked. The twonk might have been plinked, but it's not necessary that they were. The statement only rules out the necessity of the twonk being plinked, not the possibility.\n\nAnswer: no",
