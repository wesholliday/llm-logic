The negation of a statement does not necessarily imply the possibility of the opposite statement being true. For example, \"It's not the case that John is happy\" does not necessarily mean that John might be unhappy, as John could be neutral or have a different emotional state.\n\nIn this case, the original statement only rules out the possibility that the glip must have been slogged, but it does not provide any information about whether the glip might or might not have been slogged. The glip could have been slogged, or it could not have been slogged, but the original statement does not provide any evidence to support either possibility.\n\nAnswer: no",
