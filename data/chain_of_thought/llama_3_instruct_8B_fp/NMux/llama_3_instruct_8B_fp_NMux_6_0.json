It's saying that it's not necessary for the grommet to have been sploffed. This does not necessarily imply that the grommet might not have been sploffed. The grommet could have been sploffed, but it's not necessary that it was. The statement only rules out the necessity of the event, not the possibility.\n\nAnswer: no",
