The word \"must\" implies a high degree of certainty or necessity. The negation of this statement is not saying that the smonk might not have been vreebled, but rather that the necessity of the smonk being vreebled is not the case. This does not necessarily imply that the smonk might not have been vreebled, as it could have been vreebled, but not necessarily.\n\nAnswer: no",
