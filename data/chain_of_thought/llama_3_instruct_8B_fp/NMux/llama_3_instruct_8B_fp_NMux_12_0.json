It's saying that it's not necessary for the smip to have been shripped. This does not necessarily imply that the smip might not have been shripped. The smip might still have been shripped, but it's not necessary that it was. The statement only rules out the necessity of shripping, not the possibility.\n\nAnswer: no",
