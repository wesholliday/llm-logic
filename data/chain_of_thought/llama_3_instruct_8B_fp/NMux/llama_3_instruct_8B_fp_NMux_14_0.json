It's saying that it's not necessary for the clug to have been fleeked. This does not necessarily imply that the clug might not have been fleeked. The clug might have been fleeked, but it's not necessary that it was. The statement only rules out the necessity of the clug being fleeked, not the possibility.\n\nAnswer: no",
