The negation of a statement is not the same as the statement's opposite. The negation of \"The splat must have been morphed\" is \"The splat might not have been morphed\", which is a weaker statement. The original statement does not provide any information about the possibility of the splat being morphed, it only negates the necessity of it being morphed. Therefore, we cannot infer that the splat might not have been morphed.\n\nAnswer: no",
