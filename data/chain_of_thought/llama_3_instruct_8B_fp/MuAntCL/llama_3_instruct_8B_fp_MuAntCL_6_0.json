            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The concert must have been sold out\" only provides information about the concert's attendance, specifically that it was fully booked. It does not provide any information about the start time of the concert. The start time of the concert is an independent variable that is not related to the fact that the concert was sold out. Therefore, we cannot infer that the concert started at 8 PM or any other specific time.\n\nAnswer: no",
