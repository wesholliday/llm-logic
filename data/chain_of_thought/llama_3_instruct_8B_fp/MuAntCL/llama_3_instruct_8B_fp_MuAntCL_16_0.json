It does not provide any information about the specific tasks that were performed during the cleaning, such as replacing towels. Therefore, we cannot infer that the room had fresh towels. The statement only establishes a connection between the room and daily cleaning, but it does not provide any additional details about the contents or state of the room.\n\nAnswer: no",
