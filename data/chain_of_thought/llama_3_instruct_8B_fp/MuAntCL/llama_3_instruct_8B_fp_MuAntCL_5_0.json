The statement does not rule out the possibility that the package was delivered yesterday but not signed for, or that it was delivered yesterday and signed for, or that it was delivered yesterday and not signed for. Therefore, we cannot infer that the package must have been delivered yesterday and signed for.\n\nAnswer: no",
