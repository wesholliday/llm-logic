We want to know if we can infer that \"The flob is skizzled\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the flob does not necessarily have to be movated. This means that there is a possibility that the flob is not movated.\n\nThe second statement says that either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled. This is a disjunction, which means that one of the two options must be true.\n\nSince we know that the flob does not necessarily have to be movated (from the first statement), we can conclude that the second option in the disjunction must be true, which is that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
