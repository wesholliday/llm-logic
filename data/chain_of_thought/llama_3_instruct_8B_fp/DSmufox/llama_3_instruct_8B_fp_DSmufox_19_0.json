We want to know if we can infer that \"The smonk is vreebled\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the smonk cannot be plagged. From the second statement, we know that either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled. Since we know that the smonk cannot be plagged, we can conclude that it must be vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
