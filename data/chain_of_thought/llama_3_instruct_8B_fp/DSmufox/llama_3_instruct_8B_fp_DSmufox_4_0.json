We want to know if we can infer that \"The fribble is snurgled\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the fribble does not have to be crinked. This means that the possibility of the fribble being crinked is excluded.\n\nThe second statement says that either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled. Since we have already excluded the possibility of the fribble being crinked, we can conclude that the fribble must be snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
