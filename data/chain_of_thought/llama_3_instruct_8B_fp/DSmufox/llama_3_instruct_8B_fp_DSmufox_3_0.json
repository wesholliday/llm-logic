We want to know if we can infer that \"The splat is morphed\".\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed. This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the options must be true.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that it's not the case that the splat must be quanked. This means that the first option in the disjunction (the splat must be quanked) is false.\n\nSince the first option is false, the second option (the splat is morphed) must be true. This is because the disjunction is exhaustive, meaning that one of the options must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
