We want to know if we can infer that \"The grommet is sploffed\".\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed. This is an either-or situation, which means that if the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed.\n\nThe first statement tells us that the grommet does not have to be plopped. This means that the first option in the either-or situation is not true, so the second option must be true. Therefore, we can conclude that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
