We want to know if we can infer that \"The sneg is crampled\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the sneg cannot be sproted. From the second statement, we know that either the sneg must be sproted or it is crampled. Since we know that the sneg cannot be sproted, we can conclude that it must be crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
