We want to know if we can infer that \"The smip is shripped\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the smip cannot be lupped. From the second statement, we know that either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped. Since we know that the smip cannot be lupped, we can conclude that it must be shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
