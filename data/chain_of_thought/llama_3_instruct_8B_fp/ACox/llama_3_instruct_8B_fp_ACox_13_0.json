However, the second statement does not explicitly state that the antecedent is true. It only provides a relationship between the antecedent and the consequent.\n\nThe first statement, \"The splat was quanked\", is an independent statement that provides additional information about the splat. However, it does not provide any direct connection to the morphing of the splat.\n\nSince the second statement only implies a relationship between morphing and quanking, but does not provide any direct evidence for the morphing of the splat, we cannot infer that \"The splat was morphed\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
