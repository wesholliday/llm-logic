This does not necessarily mean that the condition is true, only that if it were true, the consequence would follow.\n\nThe first statement, \"The flugel was zargled\", is a simple statement of fact, stating that the flugel has been zargled.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot directly infer that the flugel was blimmed. We only know that if the flugel was blimmed, then it would be zargled, but we don't know if it was actually blimmed.\n\nAnswer: no",
