            "content": "Explanation: The original statement says that if you get enough sleep, you won't be tired. This implies that sleep is a sufficient condition for not being tired. However, the original statement does not imply that sleep is a necessary condition for not being tired. In other words, it's possible to not be tired even if you don't get enough sleep.\n\nThe additional condition of doing hard labor changes the situation. Hard labor can be physically and mentally exhausting, and even if you get enough sleep, you may still be tired due to the physical demands of the labor. Therefore, we cannot infer that if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired.\n\nAnswer: no",
