The first premise presents a disjunction (either the newspaper is in the driveway or it is sitting on the porch), and the second premise denies one of the disjuncts (the newspaper isn't sitting on the porch). The conclusion then logically follows by eliminating the denied disjunct and affirming the remaining one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
