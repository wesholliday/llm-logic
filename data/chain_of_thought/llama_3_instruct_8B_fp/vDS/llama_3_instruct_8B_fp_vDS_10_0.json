In this case, the disjunction is \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it's under the bed\", and the second premise \"The missing sock isn't under the bed\" eliminates one of the disjuncts. If the missing sock is not under the bed, then it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
