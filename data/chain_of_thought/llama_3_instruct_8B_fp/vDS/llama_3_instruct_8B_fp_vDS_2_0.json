The conclusion then logically follows by eliminating the other disjunct (A).\n\nIn this case, the first premise states that the book is either on the shelf or resting on the table. The second premise denies that the book is resting on the table. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
