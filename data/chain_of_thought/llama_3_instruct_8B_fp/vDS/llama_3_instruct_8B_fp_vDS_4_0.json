In this case, the disjunction is \"Either the cat is napping on the couch or it's playing in the bedroom\", and the second premise \"The cat isn't playing in the bedroom\" eliminates one of the disjuncts. If the cat isn't playing in the bedroom, then it must be napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
