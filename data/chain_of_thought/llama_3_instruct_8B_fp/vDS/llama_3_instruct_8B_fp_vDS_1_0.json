            "content": "Explanation: The argument is a disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid form of argument. The first premise states that Fido is either inside or in the garden, which is a disjunction of two possibilities. The second premise states that Fido is not in the garden, which is a negation of one of the possibilities. The conclusion then logically follows by eliminating the other possibility, which is that Fido is inside. The argument is valid because it follows the correct logical structure of a disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer: yes",
