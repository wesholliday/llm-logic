            "content": "Explanation: To determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if it follows a valid pattern of reasoning. The argument has a conditional statement as its first premise, which states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This is a statement about the relationship between Jeff's action and Amy's action. The second premise states that Amy did not play tennis, which is a statement about Amy's action. The conclusion is that Jeff did not play basketball, which is a statement about Jeff's action.\n\nThe key to determining the validity of this argument is to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, do the premises provide sufficient evidence to support the conclusion? If the premises are true, does the conclusion necessarily follow?\n\nIn this case, the premises do not provide sufficient evidence to support the conclusion. The first premise only tells us that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis, but it does not tell us what happened if Jeff did not play basketball. The second premise tells us that Amy did not play tennis, but it does not tell us anything about Jeff's action.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that Jeff did not play basketball does not logically follow from the premises. The argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
