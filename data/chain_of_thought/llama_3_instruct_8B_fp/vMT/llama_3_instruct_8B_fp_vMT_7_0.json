            "content": "Explanation: The argument is an example of a conditional argument, where the conclusion is derived from the premises using modus tollens. The first premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race, which is a conditional statement. The second premise states that Chris did not finish the race, which is a negation of the consequent. Using modus tollens, we can infer that if the antecedent (Alex finished the race) is true, the consequent (Chris finished the race) would also be true. Since the consequent is false (Chris did not finish the race), the antecedent must also be false. Therefore, we can conclude that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
