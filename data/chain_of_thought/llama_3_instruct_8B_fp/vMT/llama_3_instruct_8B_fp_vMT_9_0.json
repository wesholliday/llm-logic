            "content": "Explanation: The argument is an example of a conditional argument, where the conclusion is derived from the premises using modus tollens. The first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and the consequent is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\". The second premise states that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This is a negation of the consequent. Using modus tollens, we can infer that if the antecedent is false, then the conclusion is true. In this case, if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then the conclusion \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" would be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
