            "content": "Explanation: The argument is an example of a modus tollens argument, which is a valid form of argument. The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. The second premise states that Sue was not at the wedding. The conclusion is that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nThe argument is valid because it follows the correct logical structure of a modus tollens argument. The first premise sets up a conditional statement, and the second premise denies the consequent of that statement. The conclusion then logically follows by denying the antecedent of the original conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
