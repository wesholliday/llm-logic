            "content": "Explanation: The argument is an example of a categorical syllogism, specifically a modus tollens argument. The first premise states that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is awake. The second premise states that the mummy is not awake. The conclusion is that the vampire is not awake. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logic.\n\nThe first premise sets up a conditional statement, stating that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is awake. The second premise then negates the consequent of the conditional statement, stating that the mummy is not awake. This is where the modus tollens comes in, as it allows us to conclude that the antecedent (the vampire being awake) must also be false.\n\nSince the argument follows the correct structure of a modus tollens, and the premises are logically consistent, the conclusion logically follows. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
