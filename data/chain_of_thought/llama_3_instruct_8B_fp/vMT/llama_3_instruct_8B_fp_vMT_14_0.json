The first premise states that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. The second premise states that the wolf was not in the den. The conclusion is that the bear was not in the cave. The argument is valid because it follows the correct logical structure of modus tollens: if A implies B, and not B, then not A.\n\nAnswer: yes",
