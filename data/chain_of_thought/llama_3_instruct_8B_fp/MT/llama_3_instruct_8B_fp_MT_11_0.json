            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" and \"The muffins were not blueberry\". We need to determine if we can infer \"The cake was not chocolate\" from these statements.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry. This is a conditional statement, and it does not provide any information about the cake's color if the muffins are not blueberry.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the muffins are not blueberry. This does not provide any direct information about the cake's color.\n\nHowever, we can use the first statement to make an inference. If the muffins are not blueberry, then the cake cannot be chocolate, because the first statement says that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry. Therefore, we can conclude that the cake is not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
