            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" and \"Amy did not play tennis\". The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the consequence (Amy playing tennis) must also be true. The second statement tells us that Amy did not play tennis. We can use this information to draw a conclusion about Jeff's basketball playing.\n\nSince Amy did not play tennis, it means that the condition in the first statement (Amy playing tennis) is not true. Therefore, the consequence (Jeff playing basketball) cannot be true either. This implies that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
