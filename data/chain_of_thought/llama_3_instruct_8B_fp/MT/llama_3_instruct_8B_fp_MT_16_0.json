            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" and \"The pants were not denim\". From the first statement, we can conclude that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. However, the second statement tells us that the pants are not denim. This means that the pants cannot be denim, which is the opposite of what we would expect if the shirt was cotton. Therefore, it is likely that the shirt is not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
