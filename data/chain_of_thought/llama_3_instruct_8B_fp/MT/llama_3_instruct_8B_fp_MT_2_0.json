We need to determine if we can infer \"The griffin was not in the forest\" from these statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the griffin being in the forest) is true, then the consequent (the unicorn being in the forest) must also be true. However, this does not mean that the converse is true, i.e., if the unicorn is not in the forest, then the griffin is not in the forest.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the unicorn is not in the forest. But this does not provide any information about the griffin's location. We cannot conclude that the griffin is not in the forest just because the unicorn is not.\n\nAnswer: no",
