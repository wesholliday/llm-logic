We need to use logical deduction to determine if we can infer \"The book was not written by James\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. However, the second statement tells us that the book is not a mystery novel. This means that the book cannot have been written by James, because if it was, it would have to be a mystery novel, but it's not.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
