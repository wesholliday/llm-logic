We need to determine if we can infer \"The vampire was not awake\" from these statements.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake. However, this does not provide any information about the vampire's state when the mummy is not awake.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the mummy is not awake. This does not provide any direct information about the vampire's state.\n\nSince we don't have any additional information that links the mummy's state to the vampire's state when the mummy is not awake, we cannot infer the vampire's state.\n\nAnswer: no",
