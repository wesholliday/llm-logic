            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" and \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\". The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Joe went to the park) is true, then the consequence (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true. The second statement is a negation of the consequence, stating that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nFrom these statements, we can conclude that the condition (Joe went to the park) is not true, because if it were true, the consequence (Lucy went to the zoo) would also be true, but we know that the consequence is false. Therefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
