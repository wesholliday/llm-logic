The banana was not yellow\n\nFrom statement 1, we can conclude that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. However, statement 2 tells us that the banana is not yellow. This means that the banana cannot be yellow, which in turn means that the apple cannot be red (since the banana being yellow is a necessary condition for the apple being red).\n\nAnswer: yes",
