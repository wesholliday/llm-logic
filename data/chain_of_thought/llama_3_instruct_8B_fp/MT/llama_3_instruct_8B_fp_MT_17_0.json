From the first statement, we can conclude that if Ben ate pasta, Kate would have eaten the salad. However, the second statement tells us that Kate did not eat the salad. This means that the condition \"Kate ate the salad\" is not met. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Ben ate pasta. However, we can conclude that if Ben ate pasta, Kate would not have eaten the salad, which is the opposite of what we know. This suggests that Ben did not eat pasta.",
