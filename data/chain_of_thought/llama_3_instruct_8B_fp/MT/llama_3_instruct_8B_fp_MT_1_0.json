            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Sue was not at the wedding\". The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true. The second statement is a categorical statement, which simply states that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that Sue was not at the wedding. However, this does not provide any information about Mary's presence at the wedding. The first statement only tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would also be at the wedding. It does not provide any information about Mary's presence when Sue is not at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding based on the given statements. We only know that Sue was not at the wedding, but we have no information about Mary's presence.\n\nAnswer: no",
