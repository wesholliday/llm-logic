            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and \"The truck was not blue\". We want to know if we can infer \"The car was not red\". To do this, we need to analyze the given statements and see if we can logically conclude the desired statement.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the car being red) is true, then the consequent (the truck being blue) must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that the antecedent is true. It only tells us that if the car is red, then the truck is blue.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the truck is not blue. This statement does not provide any information about the car. It only tells us that the truck is not blue, which is consistent with the first statement.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot logically conclude that the car is not red. The first statement only tells us that if the car is red, then the truck is blue, but it does not guarantee that the car is red. The second statement tells us that the truck is not blue, but it does not provide any information about the car.\n\nAnswer: no",
