            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" and \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\". The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the consequence (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true. The second statement tells us that the consequence (Mark bought the blue shirt) is actually false. This means that the condition (Lisa bought the red shirt) must also be false, because if it were true, the consequence would have to be true as well. Therefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
