            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" and \"The truck was not metal\". We need to determine if we can infer \"The doll was not plastic\" from these statements.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. This is a conditional statement, and it does not provide any information about the doll's material if the truck is not metal.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the truck is not metal. This does not provide any direct information about the doll's material.\n\nHowever, we can use the first statement to create a conditional statement about the doll's material. If the truck is not metal, then the doll is not plastic. This is because the first statement states that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal, and the second statement tells us that the truck is not metal. Therefore, we can conclude that the doll is not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
