However, this does not necessarily mean that if the consequent is true, then the antecedent must also be true. This is because the conditional statement does not guarantee that the antecedent is true, it only guarantees that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent will also be true.\n\nIn this case, we are given that \"Chris finished the race\" is true, but we do not have any information about whether \"Alex finished the race\" is true or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"Alex finished the race\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
