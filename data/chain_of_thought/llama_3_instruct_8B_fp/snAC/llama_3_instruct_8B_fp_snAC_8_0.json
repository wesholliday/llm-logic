The condition is that the vampire is awake, and the effect is that the mummy is awake. This does not necessarily mean that the converse is true, i.e., if the mummy is awake, then the vampire is awake.\n\nIn this case, we are given that \"The mummy was awake\" is true, but we cannot conclude that \"The vampire was awake\" is true. The original statement only implies that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is awake, but it does not imply that if the mummy is awake, then the vampire is awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
