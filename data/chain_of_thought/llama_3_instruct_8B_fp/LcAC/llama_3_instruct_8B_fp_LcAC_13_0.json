The if-then statement is saying that if the car is red, then the truck is blue. The second statement is saying that the truck is indeed blue. However, the if-then statement does not guarantee that the car is red. It only says that if the car is red, then the truck is blue. It does not say that if the truck is blue, then the car is red.\n\nThe conclusion 'The car was red' is not logically guaranteed by the given statements. We can only conclude that the truck is blue, but we cannot conclude anything about the color of the car.\n\nAnswer: no",
