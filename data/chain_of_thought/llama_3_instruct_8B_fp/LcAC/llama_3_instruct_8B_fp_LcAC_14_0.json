The wolf was in the den.\n\nWe are trying to conclude whether the bear was in the cave or not. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means it only implies the conclusion if the antecedent (the bear was in the cave) is true. The second statement is a categorical statement, which simply states a fact.\n\nTo conclude that the bear was in the cave, we need to use the first statement and the second statement together. We can do this by using the modus ponens rule, which states that if we have a conditional statement and its antecedent is true, then we can conclude the consequent.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent of the first statement is \"the bear was in the cave\", and the consequent is \"the wolf was in the den\". Since we know that the wolf was in the den (from the second statement), we can conclude that the bear was in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes",
