            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Sue was at the wedding\". The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true. The second statement is a categorical statement, which simply states that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nTo logically conclude that Mary was at the wedding, we need to use the first statement to infer that Sue was at the wedding, and then use the second statement to conclude that Mary was at the wedding. However, we cannot directly use the first statement to conclude that Mary was at the wedding, because it only tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding, but it does not tell us that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
