Amy played tennis\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This is a conditional statement, and the \"if\" part is the antecedent, while the \"then\" part is the consequent.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Amy did play tennis. However, this does not provide any direct information about Jeff's actions.\n\nTo conclude that Jeff played basketball, we would need to know that Amy playing tennis is a sufficient condition for Jeff playing basketball. But the given statements do not provide this information. We only know that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis, but we do not know the reverse.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that Jeff played basketball based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
