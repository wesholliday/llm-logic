The conditional statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" implies that if Alex finishes the race, Chris will also finish the race. The categorical statement \"Alex finished the race\" states that Alex has indeed finished the race. To infer that Chris finished the race, we need to apply the conditional statement to the categorical statement. Since Alex has finished the race, the conditional statement implies that Chris must have also finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
