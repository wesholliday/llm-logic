This is a hypothetical statement, and it does not guarantee that Lucy went to the zoo. It only states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. The second statement \"Joe went to the park\" is a factual statement, but it does not provide any information about Lucy's actions. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: no",
