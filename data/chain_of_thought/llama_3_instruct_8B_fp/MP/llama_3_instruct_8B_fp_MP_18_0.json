            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are a conditional statement and a categorical statement. The conditional statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" establishes a relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal. The categorical statement \"The doll was plastic\" provides additional information about the doll. We can use modus ponens, a valid argument form, to infer the conclusion. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement and its antecedent, we can conclude the consequent. In this case, the antecedent is \"The doll was plastic\", which is the same as the antecedent in the conditional statement. Therefore, we can apply modus ponens to conclude that the truck was metal.\n\nAnswer: yes",
