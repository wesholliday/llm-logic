            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are a conditional statement and a categorical statement. The conditional statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" implies that there is a direct relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. The categorical statement \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" provides additional information, stating that Lisa did indeed buy the red shirt. Combining these two statements, we can conclude that Mark bought the blue shirt because the conditional statement implies that Mark's action is dependent on Lisa's action, and since Lisa bought the red shirt, Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
