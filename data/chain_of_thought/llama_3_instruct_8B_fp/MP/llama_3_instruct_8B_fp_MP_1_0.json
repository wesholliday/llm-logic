            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are a conditional statement and a categorical statement. The conditional statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" implies that if Mary is at the wedding, then Sue must also be at the wedding. The categorical statement \"Mary was at the wedding\" states that Mary is indeed at the wedding. To infer that Sue was at the wedding, we need to combine these two statements. Since the conditional statement implies that if Mary is at the wedding, then Sue must also be at the wedding, and we know that Mary is at the wedding, we can conclude that Sue must also be at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
