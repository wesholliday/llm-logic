The conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" implies that there is a relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice. The categorical statement \"Sue chose pizza\" provides additional information about Sue's choice. We can use modus ponens, a rule of inference, to conclude that if the antecedent (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the consequent (Bob chose pasta) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
