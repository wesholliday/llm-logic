Tom watched football\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This is a conditional statement, which means that it only applies when the condition (Tom watched football) is true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Tom indeed watched football. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement from statement 1 to this situation. This means that since Tom watched football, Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
