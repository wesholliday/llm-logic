The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the vampire being awake) is true, then the consequence (the mummy being awake) must also be true. The second statement tells us that the condition is indeed true, as the vampire is awake. Therefore, we can apply the conditional statement to the situation and conclude that the consequence must also be true.",
