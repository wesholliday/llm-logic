            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" and \"The shirt was cotton\". The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the shirt being cotton) is true, then the consequent (the pants being denim) must also be true. The second statement tells us that the antecedent is indeed true, since the shirt is cotton. Therefore, we can conclude that the consequent must also be true, which means that the pants are denim.\n\nAnswer: yes",
