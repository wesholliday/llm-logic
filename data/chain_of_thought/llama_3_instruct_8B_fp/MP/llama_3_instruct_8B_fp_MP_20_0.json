            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement, which means that it implies a relationship between the apple's color and the banana's color. The statement is saying that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. The second statement \"The apple was red\" is a categorical statement that provides evidence that the condition in the conditional statement is true. Therefore, we can use the conditional statement to make an inference about the banana's color.\n\nAnswer: yes",
