            "content": "Explanation: We have two given statements: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" and \"The book was written by James\". The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the book was written by James) is true, then the consequence (the book is a mystery novel) must also be true. The second statement is a categorical statement, which simply states a fact about the book. We can combine these two statements by using the first statement as a premise and the second statement as evidence. This allows us to conclude that the condition (the book was written by James) is true, and therefore the consequence (the book is a mystery novel) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
