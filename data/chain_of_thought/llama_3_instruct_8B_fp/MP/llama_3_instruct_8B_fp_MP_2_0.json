The griffin was in the forest\n\nWe are trying to infer whether the unicorn was in the forest. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means it only implies the conclusion if the condition is true. In this case, the condition is \"the griffin was in the forest\". Since we know the griffin was in the forest from statement 2, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
