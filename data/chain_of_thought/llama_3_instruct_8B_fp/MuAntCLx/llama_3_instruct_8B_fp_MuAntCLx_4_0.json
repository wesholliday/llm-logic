However, it does not provide any information about the bimboozle's presence or absence at any other location, including the flump quazzle. Therefore, we cannot infer that the bimboozle must be at snorkel quank and in the flump quazzle, as there is no logical connection between the two locations.\n\nAnswer: no",
