However, the additional phrase \"and froodle a wobble quank\" is not present in the original sentence. This additional phrase is not a logical extension or a direct consequence of the original sentence. It appears to be a new and unrelated statement.\n\nThe original sentence is a standalone statement, and the additional phrase is not a necessary or logical conclusion that can be inferred from it. Therefore, it is not possible to infer the additional phrase from the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: no",
