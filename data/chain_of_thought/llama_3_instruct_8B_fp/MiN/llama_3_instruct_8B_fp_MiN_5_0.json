It's saying that there is a chance that Jeff did not play basketball. This does not necessarily mean that Jeff did not play basketball, but rather that it's a possibility. To infer that \"It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball\" would be to conclude that Jeff did not play basketball, which is not necessarily the case. The original statement only rules out the possibility that Jeff must have played basketball, but does not rule out the possibility that Jeff did play basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
