            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been notarized\" implies that the document has undergone a notarization process, which typically involves verifying the identity of the person signing the document and witnessing their signature. However, it does not explicitly state that the document was signed. It is possible that the document was notarized without being signed, although this is unlikely in most cases. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the document was signed.\n\nAnswer: no",
