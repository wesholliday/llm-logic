            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence \"The project might be completed by Friday or extended\" is a disjunction, which means it presents two mutually exclusive possibilities. The word \"or\" in this context is an exclusive or, meaning that the project can either be completed by Friday or it can be extended, but not both. The sentence is implying that the project will either meet its deadline or exceed it, but it's not saying that it might do both.\n\nAnswer: yes",
