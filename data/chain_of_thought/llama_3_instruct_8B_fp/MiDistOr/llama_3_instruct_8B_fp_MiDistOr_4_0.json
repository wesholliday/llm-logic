            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or be cancelled\" is a disjunction, which is a sentence that combines two or more clauses using \"or\". The word \"or\" in this sentence is a logical operator that indicates that one of the two clauses must be true. The first clause \"The meeting might start at 2 PM\" suggests that there is a possibility that the meeting will start at 2 PM. The second clause \"be cancelled\" suggests that there is also a possibility that the meeting will be cancelled. The use of \"or\" implies that one of these possibilities must occur, but it does not specify which one.\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or it might be cancelled\". This sentence is a repetition of the original sentence, with the same structure and wording. Since the original sentence is already a disjunction, we can infer that the sentence \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or it might be cancelled\" is indeed true, as it is a restatement of the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
