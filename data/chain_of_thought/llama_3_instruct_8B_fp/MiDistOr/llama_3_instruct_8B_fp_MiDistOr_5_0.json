            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package might be delivered today or tomorrow\" is a disjunction, which means it's a statement that combines two possibilities. The word \"or\" is used to indicate that one or both of the possibilities might occur. In this case, the possibilities are that the package might be delivered today or tomorrow. The statement is not saying that the package will definitely be delivered today, but rather that it's possible that it might be delivered today, and also possible that it might be delivered tomorrow.\n\nThe question is asking if we can infer a slightly modified statement, which is \"The package might be delivered today or it might be delivered tomorrow\". This statement is also a disjunction, but it's a bit more specific than the original statement. It's saying that the package might be delivered today, and also that it might be delivered tomorrow, but not necessarily both.\n\nWe can infer this modified statement from the original statement because the original statement already implies that the package might be delivered today or tomorrow. The original statement is not saying that the package will definitely be delivered today or tomorrow, but rather that it's possible that it might be delivered on one of those days. Therefore, we can infer that the package might be delivered today, and also that it might be delivered tomorrow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
