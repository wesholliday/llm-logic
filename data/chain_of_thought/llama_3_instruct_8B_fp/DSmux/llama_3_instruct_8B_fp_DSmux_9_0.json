It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the twonk is either varnished or it must be plinked. From statement 2, we know that it's not the case that the twonk must be plinked.\n\nThis implies that the twonk cannot be plinked, since it's not the case that it must be plinked. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
