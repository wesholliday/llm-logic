It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned. This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the options must be true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that it's not the case that the fleeg must be surned. This means that the second option in the disjunction (it must be surned) is false.\n\nSince the second option is false, the only remaining option is that the fleeg is bluttered. Therefore, we can infer that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
