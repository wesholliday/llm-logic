It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the wug is either flooped or it must be bimmed. From statement 2, we know that it's not the case that the wug must be bimmed. This implies that the wug is not bimmed.\n\nNow, we can use the principle of excluded middle, which states that a statement is either true or its negation is true. Since the wug is not bimmed, it must be flooped. This is because the only other option is that the wug is bimmed, which we have already ruled out.\n\nAnswer: yes",
