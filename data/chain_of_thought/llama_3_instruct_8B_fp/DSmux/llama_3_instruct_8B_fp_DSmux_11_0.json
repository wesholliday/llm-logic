It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed. This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the options must be true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that it's not the case that the flug must be zimmed. This means that the second option in the disjunction (it must be zimmed) is false.\n\nSince the second option is false, the only remaining option is that the flug is blummed. Therefore, we can infer that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
