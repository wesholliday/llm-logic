It's not the case that the wug must be garpled.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the wug is either sproinged or it must be garpled. From statement 2, we know that it's not the case that the wug must be garpled. This implies that the wug is not garpled.\n\nNow, we can use the principle of excluded middle, which states that a statement is either true or false. Since the wug is not garpled, it must be sproinged. This is because the only other option is that it must be garpled, but we know that's not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
