It's not the case that the clug must be snugged.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that either the clug is fleeked or it must be snugged. This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the options must be true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that it's not the case that the clug must be snugged. This implies that the clug is not snugged.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If the clug is fleeked, then it's indeed fleeked, and the disjunction in statement 1 is satisfied.\n* If the clug is not fleeked, then it must be snugged (by statement 1). But we know that it's not snugged (by statement 2). This is a contradiction, so this option is ruled out.\n\nSince we've ruled out the possibility that the clug is not fleeked, we can conclude that the clug is indeed fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
