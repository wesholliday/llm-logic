We need to determine if we can infer \"The splat is morphed\" from these statements.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked. This is an either-or situation, and we can't conclude which one is true.\n\nThe second statement tells us that it's not the case that the splat must be quanked. This means that the splat is not quanked.\n\nNow, let's combine the information. We know that either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked, but we also know that it's not quanked. This means that the only possibility left is that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
