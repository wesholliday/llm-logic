It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled. This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the options must be true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that it's not the case that the flugel must be zargled. This means that the second option in the disjunction (it must be zargled) is false.\n\nSince the second option is false, the only remaining option is that the flugel is blimmed. Therefore, we can infer that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
