It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled. This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the options must be true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that it's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled. This implies that the zinger is not smoogled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If the zinger is fraggled, then statement 1 is true, and we don't need to consider the second option (it must be smoogled).\n* If the zinger is not fraggled, then it must be smoogled (by statement 1). But we know from statement 2 that it's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled, which is a contradiction.\n\nSince we've ruled out the possibility that the zinger is not fraggled, we can conclude that the zinger is indeed fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
