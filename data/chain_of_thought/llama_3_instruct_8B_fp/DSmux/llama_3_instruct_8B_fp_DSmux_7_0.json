It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the whiffle is either shanked or it must be tinked. From statement 2, we know that it's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked. This implies that the whiffle is not tinked.\n\nNow, we can use the principle of excluded middle, which states that a statement is either true or false. Since the whiffle is not tinked, it must be shanked. This is because the only other option is that it must be tinked, but we know that's not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
