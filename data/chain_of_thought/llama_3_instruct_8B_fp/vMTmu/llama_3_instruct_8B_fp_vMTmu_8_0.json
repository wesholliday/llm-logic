            "content": "Explanation: The argument is trying to conclude that the vampire was not awake based on the premises. The first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. This is a conditional statement, which means that it's saying that one thing (the vampire being awake) implies another thing (the mummy being awake). The second premise states that it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake. This is a negation of the conclusion of the first premise.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake, according to the first premise. But the second premise says that this is not the case. Therefore, we can conclude that the vampire was not awake, because if it was awake, the mummy would have been awake, but the mummy is not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
