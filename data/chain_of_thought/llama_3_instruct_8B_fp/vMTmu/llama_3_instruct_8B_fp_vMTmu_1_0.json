            "content": "Explanation: The argument is trying to conclude that Mary was not at the wedding based on the fact that Sue must not have been at the wedding. The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding, which implies a conditional relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence. The second premise states that Sue must not have been at the wedding, which seems to contradict the first premise.\n\nHowever, the argument is trying to use the second premise to conclude that Mary was not at the wedding. This is where the logical validity of the argument comes into question. The conclusion is trying to use the negation of Sue's presence to infer Mary's absence, but this is not a valid inference.\n\nThe first premise only establishes a conditional relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence, it does not provide any information about Mary's presence or absence in isolation. The second premise only provides information about Sue's presence, but it does not provide any information about Mary's presence.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because it is trying to use the negation of Sue's presence to infer Mary's absence, which is not a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
