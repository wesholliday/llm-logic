            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package might be delivered today or tomorrow\" implies that there are two possible days when the package might be delivered. The word \"or\" is used to indicate that these are the only two possibilities. This means that the package might be delivered on either today or tomorrow, but not on any other day. Therefore, we can infer that the package might be delivered today, as it is one of the two possible days mentioned.\n\nAnswer: yes",
