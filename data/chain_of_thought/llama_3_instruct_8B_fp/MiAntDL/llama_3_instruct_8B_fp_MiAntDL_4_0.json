            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The meeting might be at 2 PM or cancelled\" is a disjunction, which means it presents two possible outcomes. The first outcome is \"The meeting might be at 2 PM\", and the second outcome is \"cancelled\". The use of \"or\" implies that both outcomes are possible, but not necessarily mutually exclusive. Since the statement does not explicitly rule out the possibility of the meeting being at 2 PM, we can infer that it is a possible outcome.\n\nAnswer: yes",
