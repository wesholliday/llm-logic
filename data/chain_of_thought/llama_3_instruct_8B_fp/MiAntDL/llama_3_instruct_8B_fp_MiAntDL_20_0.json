            "content": "Explanation: The sentence \"The event might be formal or semi-formal\" is a disjunctive statement, which means it presents two mutually exclusive options. The word \"or\" is used to indicate that the event can be either formal or semi-formal, but not both at the same time. Since \"formal\" is one of the options, it is reasonable to infer that the event might indeed be formal.\n\nAnswer: yes",
