This type of statement is called a conditional statement. The conditional statement does not provide any information about the opposite scenario, i.e., what would happen if the condition is not met. To infer the opposite scenario, we would need a statement that explicitly states the relationship between the condition and its negation.\n\nIn this case, the given statement does not provide any information about what would happen if the alien did not visit Mars. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: no",
