            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement, \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\". This statement is saying that if the condition \"the doll was plastic\" is true, then the consequence \"the truck was metal\" must also be true. However, this statement does not provide any information about what happens when the condition \"the doll was plastic\" is false. It only tells us what happens when the condition is true.\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal\", we would need additional information that would allow us to conclude that the converse of the original statement is also true. However, the original statement does not provide that information.\n\nFor example, if we knew that the truck was always metal, regardless of the material of the doll, then we could infer that if the doll was not plastic, the truck was not metal. But without that additional information, we cannot make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
