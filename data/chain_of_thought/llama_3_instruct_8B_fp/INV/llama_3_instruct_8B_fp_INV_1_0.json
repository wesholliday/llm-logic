            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement, which means that it implies a relationship between the two statements. Specifically, it implies that if Mary is at the wedding, then Sue is also at the wedding. However, this does not necessarily imply the converse, which is \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\".\n\nThe original statement only provides information about the relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence when Mary is at the wedding, but it does not provide any information about what happens when Mary is not at the wedding. Therefore, we cannot infer the converse statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
