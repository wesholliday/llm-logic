            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement, which means that it implies a relationship between the two conditions. The statement is saying that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. However, this statement does not provide any information about what would happen if the apple is not red. It only provides information about what happens when the apple is red.\n\nTo infer that \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\", we would need additional information or a separate statement that provides a relationship between the conditions when the apple is not red. The original statement does not provide this information, so we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
