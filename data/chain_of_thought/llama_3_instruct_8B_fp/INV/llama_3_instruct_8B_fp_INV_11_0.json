This statement is saying that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. However, this does not imply that if the cake is not chocolate, then the muffins must not be blueberry.\n\nThe original statement only provides information about the relationship between the cake being chocolate and the muffins being blueberry, but it does not provide any information about the relationship between the cake not being chocolate and the muffins not being blueberry. There could be other possibilities, such as the muffins being blueberry even if the cake is not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
