            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is a conditional statement, which means that it implies a cause-and-effect relationship between the two entities. The statement is saying that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the vampire is not awake, then the mummy is not awake.\n\nThe original statement does not provide any information about what happens when the vampire is not awake. It only provides information about what happens when the vampire is awake. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the vampire is not awake, then the mummy is not awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
