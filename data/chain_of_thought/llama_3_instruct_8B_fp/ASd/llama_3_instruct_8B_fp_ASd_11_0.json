            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired\" is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between getting enough sleep and not being tired. It implies that getting enough sleep is a sufficient condition for not being tired. However, the original statement does not provide any information about the relationship between getting enough sleep and doing hard labor. It does not imply that getting enough sleep is a sufficient condition for not being tired when doing hard labor. In fact, doing hard labor can still cause fatigue even if you get enough sleep. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
