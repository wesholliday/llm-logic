However, the statement does not specify the quality or condition of the medication. The statement does not rule out the possibility that the medication may not be effective or may even be harmful if it is expired or of poor quality.\n\nThe statement \"If I take medication that expired, I will feel better\" is a specific instance of the original statement, but it is not logically implied by the original statement. The original statement does not provide enough information to make a conclusion about the effectiveness of expired medication.\n\nAnswer: no",
