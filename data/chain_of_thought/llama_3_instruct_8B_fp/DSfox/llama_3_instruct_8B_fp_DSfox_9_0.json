We need to determine if we can infer that \"The twonk is varnished\" from these statements.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the twonk is not plinked. This gives us a negative information about the twonk's state.\n\nThe second statement is a disjunction, which means it is saying that either the twonk is plinked or it is varnished. This gives us two possibilities: the twonk is plinked or the twonk is varnished.\n\nSince we know that the twonk is not plinked (from the first statement), we can eliminate the first possibility. This leaves us with only one possibility: the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
