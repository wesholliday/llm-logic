We can start by analyzing the second statement, which is a disjunction (either/or) statement. This means that one of the two options must be true, but we don't know which one. The first statement tells us that the first option (\"the fleeg is surned\") is false. Therefore, we can conclude that the second option (\"the fleeg is bluttered\") must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
