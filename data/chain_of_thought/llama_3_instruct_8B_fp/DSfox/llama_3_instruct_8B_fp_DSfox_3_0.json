            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"The splat is not quanked\" and \"Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed\". We can start by analyzing the second statement, which is a disjunction (a statement that says something is either A or B). This means that one of the two options must be true. If the splat is quanked, then the first statement \"The splat is not quanked\" would be false, which would mean that the second statement is also false. But this is impossible, since a disjunction can never be false if one of its options is true. Therefore, the first option \"The splat is quanked\" must be false. This means that the second option \"The splat is morphed\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
