From the first statement, we know that the wug is not bimmed. The second statement is a disjunction, which means it is either true or false. If the wug is not bimmed, then the first part of the disjunction \"the wug is bimmed\" must be false. Therefore, the second part of the disjunction \"it is flooped\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
