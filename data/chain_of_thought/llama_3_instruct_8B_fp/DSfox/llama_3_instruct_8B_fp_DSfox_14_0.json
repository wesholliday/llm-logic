We need to determine if we can infer that \"The clug is fleeked\" from these two statements.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the clug is not snugged. This gives us a negative information about the clug's state.\n\nThe second statement is a disjunction, which means it is either \"snugged\" or \"fleeked\", but not both. Since we already know that the clug is not snugged, we can conclude that it must be \"fleeked\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
