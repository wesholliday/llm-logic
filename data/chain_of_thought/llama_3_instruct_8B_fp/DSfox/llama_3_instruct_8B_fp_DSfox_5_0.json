The second statement is a disjunction, which means it is saying that one of the two options is true. The first statement is saying that the first option (\"the zinger is smoogled\") is false.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that the second option (\"the zinger is fraggled\") must be true. This is because the first option is false, and the second option is the only remaining possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
