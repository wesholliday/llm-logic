We need to determine if we can infer that \"The flug is blummed\".\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the flug is either zimmed or blummed. However, the first statement tells us that the flug is not zimmed. This means that the only possibility left is that the flug is blummed.\n\nSince we have eliminated the possibility of the flug being zimmed, and the second statement guarantees that the flug is either zimmed or blummed, we can conclude that the flug must be blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
