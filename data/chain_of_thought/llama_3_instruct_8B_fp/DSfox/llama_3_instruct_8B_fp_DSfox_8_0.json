            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"The sprocket is not daggled\" and \"Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked\". We can start by analyzing the second statement, which is a disjunction (either/or) statement. This means that one of the two options must be true. If the sprocket is not daggled, then the first option \"the sprocket is daggled\" is false. Therefore, the second option \"the sprocket is cranked\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
