We can start by analyzing the second statement, which is a disjunction (a statement that says something is either true or true). This means that one of the two options must be true, but we don't know which one. The first statement tells us that the first option (\"the whiffle is tinked\") is false. Since the second option (\"the whiffle is shanked\") is the only remaining option, we can conclude that it must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
