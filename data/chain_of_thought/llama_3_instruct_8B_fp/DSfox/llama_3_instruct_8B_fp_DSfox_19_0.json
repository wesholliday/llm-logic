We need to determine if we can infer that \"The smonk is vreebled\" from these two statements.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the smonk is not plagged. This gives us a negative information about the smonk's state.\n\nThe second statement is a disjunction, which means it is either plagged or vreebled, but not both. Since we already know that the smonk is not plagged, we can eliminate the plagged option.\n\nThis leaves us with only one option, which is that the smonk is vreebled. Therefore, we can infer that the smonk is indeed vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
