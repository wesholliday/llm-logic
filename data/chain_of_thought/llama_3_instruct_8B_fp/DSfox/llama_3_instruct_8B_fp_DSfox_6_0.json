We can start by analyzing the second statement, which is a disjunction (a statement that says something is either true or true). This means that at least one of the two options must be true. If the grommet is not plopped, then the first option \"the grommet is plopped\" must be false. Therefore, the second option \"the grommet is sploffed\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
