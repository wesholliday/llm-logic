The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the notebook is either in the drawer or on the nightstand. Statement 2 tells us that it's possible that the notebook is not on the nightstand.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If the notebook is not on the nightstand (as stated in statement 2), then it must be in the drawer (according to statement 1).\n* If the notebook is on the nightstand, then statement 2 doesn't provide any new information, and we can't conclude anything about the notebook's location.\n\nSince statement 2 only provides information about the notebook not being on the nightstand, we can't infer anything about the notebook's location if it's actually on the nightstand. However, if the notebook is not on the nightstand, we can conclude that it's in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
