The book might not be resting on the table.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the book is either on the shelf or on the table. Statement 2 tells us that the book might not be on the table. This means that the book could be on the shelf, but we can't conclude that it definitely is.\n\nThe key point is that statement 1 does not provide a direct contradiction to statement 2. It only provides a disjunction (either/or) between the book being on the shelf or on the table. Since statement 2 does not rule out the possibility of the book being on the shelf, we cannot infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: no",
