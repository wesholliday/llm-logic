The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the scarf is either in the backpack or on the coat rack. Statement 2 tells us that the scarf might not be on the coat rack, which means it is possible that the scarf is not on the coat rack.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If the scarf is not on the coat rack, then it must be in the backpack (by statement 1).\n* If the scarf is on the coat rack, then statement 2 tells us that this is not the case, so the scarf must be in the backpack.\n\nIn either case, we can conclude that the scarf is indeed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
