The pen might not be on my desk.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the pen is either in my bag or on my desk. Statement 2 tells us that the pen might not be on my desk, which means it is possible that the pen is not on my desk.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If the pen is not on my desk, then it must be in my bag (from statement 1).\n* If the pen is on my desk, then statement 2 would be false, which is possible but not certain.\n\nSince we cannot conclude for certain that the pen is on my desk, we cannot infer that the pen is not in my bag. Therefore, we cannot infer that the pen is in my bag.\n\nAnswer: no",
