The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the cookies are either in the jar or in the pantry. Statement 2 tells us that the cookies might not be in the pantry, which means they could be in the jar.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer that the cookies are in the jar. The statements only provide information about the cookies' possible locations, but they do not provide conclusive evidence that the cookies are actually in the jar.\n\nAnswer: no",
