The second statement, \"The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor\", adds a possibility that the piece is not blending in on the floor. This does not provide any new information about the piece being in the box or not. The original options remain the same. We cannot conclude that the piece is definitely in the box because the second statement only rules out one of the two possibilities, not the other.\n\nAnswer: no",
