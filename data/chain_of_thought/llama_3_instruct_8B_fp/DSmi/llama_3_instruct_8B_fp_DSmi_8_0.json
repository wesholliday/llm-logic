            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are:\n\n1. Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\n2. The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the remote control is either on the coffee table or under the couch. This is an exhaustive list of possibilities, meaning that the remote control is either in one of these two locations.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch. This implies that there is a possibility that the remote control is not under the couch.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If the remote control is not under the couch, then it must be on the coffee table (by statement 1).\n* If the remote control is under the couch, then statement 2 tells us that it might not be, which means it could be on the coffee table instead.\n\nIn both cases, we can conclude that the remote control is on the coffee table. Therefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
