The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the umbrella is either in the car or it is tucked away in the closet. Statement 2 tells us that it is possible that the umbrella is not tucked away in the closet.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If the umbrella is not tucked away in the closet (as stated in statement 2), then it must be in the car (according to statement 1).\n* If the umbrella is tucked away in the closet, then it is not in the car (according to statement 1).\n\nSince we know that the umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet (statement 2), we can conclude that it is possible that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
