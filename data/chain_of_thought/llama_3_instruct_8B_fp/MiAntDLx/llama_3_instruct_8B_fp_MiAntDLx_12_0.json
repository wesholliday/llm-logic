The word \"or\" is used to indicate that one of the two options is possible. However, the sentence does not provide any information that would allow us to infer that the blurble might be blimple by zizz exclusively. The sentence only presents two possibilities, but it does not rule out the possibility that the blurble might be blimple by zazzle instead.\n\nAnswer: no",
