            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence is a conditional statement, stating that the fribble might be either on the blurble or in the wobble. The use of the word \"or\" implies that the fribble could be in one of two possible locations. However, the sentence does not explicitly state that the fribble is not on the blurble, it only provides an alternative location. Therefore, we cannot infer that the fribble is not on the blurble, but we can infer that it might be on the blurble.\n\nAnswer: yes",
