This means that there is a possibility that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet. The second statement says that either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer. This statement is a disjunction, which means that it presents two mutually exclusive options. If the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, then they must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
