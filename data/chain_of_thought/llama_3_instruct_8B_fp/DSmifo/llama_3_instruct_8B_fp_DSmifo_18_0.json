            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements. The first statement says that the notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand, which means that there is a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand. The second statement says that either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer. This statement is a disjunction, which means that it presents two mutually exclusive options. If the notebook is not on the nightstand, then it must be in the drawer, since it cannot be in both places at the same time.\n\nAnswer: yes",
