The first statement tells us that the pen's presence on the desk is uncertain, but it doesn't provide any information about the pen's location. The second statement provides a binary choice: either the pen is on the desk or it is in the bag. Since the first statement doesn't rule out the possibility of the pen being in the bag, we can conclude that the pen might be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
