This means that the milk could be on the counter.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that there are only two possibilities: the milk is either in the fridge or on the counter. Since statement 1 suggests that the milk might not be in the fridge, it is possible that the milk is indeed on the counter.\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude with certainty that the milk is on the counter. The statements do not provide enough information to rule out the possibility that the milk is actually in the fridge. Therefore, we cannot infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: no",
