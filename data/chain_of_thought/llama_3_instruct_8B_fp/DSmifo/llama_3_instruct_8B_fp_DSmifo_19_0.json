            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"The watch might not be on his wrist\" and \"Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser\". From the first statement, we know that the possibility of the watch being on his wrist is not certain. The second statement provides two alternatives: either the watch is on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser. Since the first statement tells us that the watch might not be on his wrist, we can conclude that the second alternative (it is charging on the dresser) is more likely to be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
