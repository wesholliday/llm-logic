This means that the jacket does not have to be draped over the chair, but it does not necessarily mean that it is not draped over the chair. The jacket could still be draped over the chair, but it is not required to be. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that the jacket might not be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: no",
