The negation of \"must have\" does not necessarily mean \"might not have\". It could also mean \"might have\" or \"may not have\" (i.e., it's possible that Alex didn't finish the race, but we can't conclude that with certainty). We need more information to determine whether Alex finished the race or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
