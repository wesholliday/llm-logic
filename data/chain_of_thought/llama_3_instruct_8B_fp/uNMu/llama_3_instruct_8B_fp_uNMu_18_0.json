This negation does not provide any information about the actual location of the notebook. It only tells us that the notebook's location is not determined or guaranteed to be in the drawer. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the notebook is definitely not in the drawer, but we can infer that the notebook might not be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
