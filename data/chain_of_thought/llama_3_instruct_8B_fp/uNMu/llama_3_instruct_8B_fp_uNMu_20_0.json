It only negates the possibility that the sunglasses must be in her bag, which means that there is no logical necessity for the sunglasses to be in her bag. However, it does not provide any information about the actual location of the sunglasses. Therefore, we cannot infer that the sunglasses might not be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: no",
