It's saying that it's not necessary for the alien to have visited Mars. This doesn't necessarily imply that the alien might not have visited Mars. The alien could have visited Mars, but it's not necessary for it to have done so. We can't infer that the alien didn't visit Mars from this statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
