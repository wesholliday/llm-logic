            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" does not provide any direct information about Mary's presence at the wedding. The phrase \"must have been\" implies a necessity or certainty, but the statement is negating that necessity, which means it's not saying anything about the possibility of Mary being at the wedding. It's simply saying that it's not a requirement for her to have been there. Therefore, we cannot infer that Mary might not have been at the wedding from this statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
