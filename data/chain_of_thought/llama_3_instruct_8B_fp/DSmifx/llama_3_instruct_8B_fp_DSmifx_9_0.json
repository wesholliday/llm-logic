The twonk might not be plinked.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the twonk must be varnished or it is plinked. This implies that the twonk is either varnished or plinked, but not both.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the twonk might not be plinked. This implies that the possibility of the twonk not being plinked is not zero.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If the twonk is plinked, then it cannot be varnished (since it's either varnished or plinked, but not both).\n* If the twonk is not plinked, then it must be varnished (since it's either varnished or plinked, and it's not plinked).\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can conclude that the twonk is indeed varnished. If it's not plinked, then it must be varnished. If it's plinked, then it cannot be varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
