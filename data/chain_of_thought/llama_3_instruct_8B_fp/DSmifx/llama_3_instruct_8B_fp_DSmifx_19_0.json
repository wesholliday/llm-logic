The smonk might not be plagged\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the smonk is either plagged or vreebled. From statement 2, we know that the smonk might not be plagged. This implies that the smonk could be vreebled, but it does not necessarily mean that it is vreebled.\n\nThe key point is that the smonk might not be plagged, which leaves open the possibility that it is vreebled. However, we cannot conclude that the smonk is definitely vreebled, as it could also be plagged.\n\nAnswer: no",
