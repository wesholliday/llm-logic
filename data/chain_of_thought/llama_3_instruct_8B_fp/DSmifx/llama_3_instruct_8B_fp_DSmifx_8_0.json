The sprocket might not be daggled.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the sprocket is either daggled or cranked. This is an exclusive or statement, which means that if the sprocket is daggled, it cannot be cranked, and if it is cranked, it cannot be daggled.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the sprocket might not be daggled. This does not provide any information about whether the sprocket is cranked or not.\n\nSince the sprocket might not be daggled, it is possible that it is cranked. However, we cannot conclude that it is cranked with certainty. There is still a possibility that the sprocket is not cranked.\n\nAnswer: no",
