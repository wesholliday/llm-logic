The fleeg might not be surned\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the fleeg is either surned or bluttered. This is an exclusive or statement, which means that if the fleeg is surned, it cannot be bluttered, and vice versa.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the possibility of the fleeg not being surned exists. This does not provide any information about the fleeg being bluttered.\n\nSince the fleeg might not be surned, it is possible that the fleeg is bluttered. However, we cannot conclude that the fleeg is definitely bluttered. There is still a possibility that the fleeg is surned.\n\nAnswer: no",
