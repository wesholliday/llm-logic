The shank might not be nugged.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the shank is either nugged or plooked. This is an exclusive or statement, which means that if the shank is nugged, it cannot be plooked, and vice versa.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the shank might not be nugged. This implies that the shank could be plooked, since it is not necessarily nugged.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer that the shank is plooked. The shank could be neither nugged nor plooked, or it could be plooked but not necessarily.\n\nAnswer: no",
