The fribble might not be crinked\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the fribble is either crinked or snurgled. This is an exclusive or statement, which means that if the fribble is crinked, it cannot be snurgled, and vice versa.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the fribble might not be crinked. This does not provide any information about whether the fribble is snurgled or not.\n\nSince the fribble might not be crinked, it is possible that it is snurgled. However, we cannot conclude that the fribble is definitely snurgled. There is still a possibility that the fribble is neither crinked nor snurgled.\n\nAnswer: no",
