The flug might not be zimmed.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the flug is either zimmed or blummed. This is an exclusive or statement, which means that if the flug is not zimmed, then it must be blummed.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the flug might not be zimmed. This means that there is a possibility that the flug is not zimmed.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that the flug is not zimmed. Since the flug is not zimmed, it must be blummed, as stated in statement 1.\n\nAnswer: no",
