The flugel might not be zargled\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the flugel is either zargled or blimmed. This is an exclusive or statement, which means that if the flugel is zargled, it cannot be blimmed, and vice versa.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the flugel might not be zargled. This implies that there is a possibility that the flugel is not zargled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n* If the flugel is not zargled, then from statement 1, it must be blimmed. This is because the flugel is either zargled or blimmed, and it's not zargled.\n* If the flugel is zargled, then from statement 1, it cannot be blimmed. This is because the flugel is either zargled or blimmed, and it's already zargled.\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude that the flugel is blimmed. The possibility that the flugel is not zargled and blimmed is still open. We cannot rule out this possibility.\n\nAnswer: no",
