The smip might not be lupped\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the smip must be either lupped or shripped. From statement 2, we know that the smip might not be lupped. This implies that the smip could be shripped.\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude that the smip is shripped. The smip could still be lupped, and we have no information to rule out this possibility.\n\nAnswer: no",
