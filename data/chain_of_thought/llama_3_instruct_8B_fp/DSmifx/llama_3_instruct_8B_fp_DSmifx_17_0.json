The flob might not be movated\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the flob is either movated or skizzled. This is an exclusive or statement, which means that if the flob is movated, it cannot be skizzled, and vice versa.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the possibility of the flob being movated is not ruled out. This means that the flob might be movated, but it does not necessarily mean that it is not skizzled.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer that the flob is skizzled from these statements. The possibility of the flob being movated is still present, and we cannot eliminate it.\n\nAnswer: no",
