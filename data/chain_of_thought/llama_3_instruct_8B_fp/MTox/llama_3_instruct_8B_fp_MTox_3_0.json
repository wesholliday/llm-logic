            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"The splat did not quank\" and \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\". We can start by analyzing the second statement, which is a conditional statement. It says that if the splat was morphed, then it quanked. This implies that if the splat was not morphed, it would not quank. Now, we can look at the first statement, which says that the splat did not quank. This statement is not directly related to the morphing of the splat, but it does provide some information. Since the splat did not quank, and if it was morphed, it would quank, we can conclude that the splat was not morphed. This is because if it was morphed, it would quank, but it didn't, so it must not have been morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
