            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"The grommet did not plop the frink\" and \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\". We want to infer whether \"The grommet was not sploffed\" is true.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the grommet did not plop the frink. This gives us a negative condition.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that if the grommet was sploffed, then it plopped the frink. This gives us a conditional relationship between being sploffed and plopping the frink.\n\nTo infer whether the grommet was not sploffed, we need to consider the possibility that the grommet was sploffed. If it was sploffed, then it would have plopped the frink according to the second statement. But we know that the grommet did not plop the frink (from the first statement). This means that the grommet cannot be sploffed, because if it were, it would have plopped the frink, which is not the case.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
