            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"The twonk was not varnished\" and \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\". We can start by analyzing the second statement, which is a conditional statement. It says that if the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished. This implies that the twonk being plinked is a sufficient condition for the twonk to be varnished.\n\nNow, let's look at the first statement: \"The twonk was not varnished\". This statement tells us that the twonk is not varnished. We can combine this information with the second statement. Since the twonk is not varnished, it cannot be the case that the twonk was plinked (because if it was plinked, it would be varnished). Therefore, we can conclude that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
