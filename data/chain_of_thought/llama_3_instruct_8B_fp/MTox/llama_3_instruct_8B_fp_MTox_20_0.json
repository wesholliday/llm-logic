            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"The fleeg did not surn\" and \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\". We can start by analyzing the second statement, which is a conditional statement. It states that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned. This implies that the fleeg surning is a consequence of the fleeg being bluttered.\n\nNow, let's look at the first statement: \"The fleeg did not surn\". This statement is a negation of the fleeg surning. Since the fleeg did not surn, it means that the fleeg is not in a state where it would surn.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from both statements. If the fleeg was bluttered, then it would surn (from the second statement). But the fleeg did not surn (from the first statement). This implies that the fleeg was not bluttered, because if it was bluttered, it would have surned.\n\nAnswer: yes",
