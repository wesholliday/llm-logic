We want to infer whether \"The whiffle was not shanked\" is true or not.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the whiffle did not tink. This gives us a negative condition.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that if the whiffle was shanked, then it tinked. This gives us a conditional relationship between being shanked and tinking.\n\nWe can combine these two statements to get: If the whiffle was not shanked, then it did not tink (since it did not tink in the first place).\n\nNow, we want to infer whether the whiffle was not shanked. We can do this by using the contrapositive of the second statement: If the whiffle did not tink, then it was not shanked.\n\nWe already know that the whiffle did not tink (from the first statement). Therefore, we can apply the contrapositive to conclude that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
