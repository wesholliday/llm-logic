            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"The sprocket was not daggled\" and \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\". We can start by analyzing the second statement, which is a conditional statement. It states that if the sprocket was cranked, then it was daggled. This implies that being cranked is a sufficient condition for being daggled.\n\nNow, let's look at the first statement: \"The sprocket was not daggled\". This statement tells us that the sprocket is not daggled.\n\nWe can now combine this information with the second statement. Since being cranked is a sufficient condition for being daggled, and the sprocket is not daggled, it means that the sprocket was not cranked. If it were cranked, it would be daggled, but since it's not daggled, it must not have been cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
