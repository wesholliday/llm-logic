            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"The dreb was not spened\" and \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\". We can start by analyzing the second statement, which is a conditional statement. It says that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was also spened. This implies that vroombed and spened are related in some way, possibly meaning the same thing.\n\nNow, let's look at the first statement: \"The dreb was not spened\". This statement is a negation of the possibility that the dreb was spened. Since vroombed and spened are related, we can infer that the dreb was not vroombed as well. This is because if the dreb was vroombed, it would also be spened, but we know it's not spened. Therefore, it's not vroombed either.\n\nAnswer: yes",
