The sneg might not have sproted the frink\n\nWe are trying to infer whether the sneg was not crampled. To do this, we need to analyze the relationships between the statements.\n\nStatement 1 is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the sneg was crampled) is true, then the consequent (the sneg must have sproted the frink) must also be true. However, this does not provide any information about the truth value of the antecedent itself.\n\nStatement 2 provides some information about the sneg's behavior, but it does not directly relate to the crumpling of the sneg.\n\nFrom these statements alone, we cannot infer whether the sneg was not crampled. We do not have enough information to conclude that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: no",
