It might not have been surned.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can conclude that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned. This implies that bluttering and surning are related in some way, possibly that one implies the other.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that it is possible that the fleeg was not surned.\n\nNow, let's try to infer the conclusion \"The fleeg was not bluttered\". If the fleeg was not bluttered, then it must not have been surned (by statement 1). But statement 2 says that it might not have been surned, which means it's possible that the fleeg was not surned. However, this does not necessarily mean that the fleeg was not bluttered. It's possible that the fleeg was bluttered and then not surned.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
