The fribble might not have crinked\n\nWe are trying to infer whether the fribble was not snurgled. To do this, we need to analyze the relationships between the statements.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked. This implies that snurgling is a sufficient condition for crinking.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the fribble might not have crinked. This implies that there is a possibility that the fribble did not crink.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the fribble was snurgled. If it was snurgled, then it must have crinked (from statement 1). But we also know that the fribble might not have crinked (from statement 2). This creates a contradiction, as we cannot simultaneously say that the fribble was snurgled and did not crink.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
