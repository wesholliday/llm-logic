The flug might not have been zimmed\n\nFrom statement 1, we can conclude that if the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed. This implies that blumming and zimming are related in some way, possibly that one implies the other.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the flug might not have been zimmed. This implies that there is a possibility that the flug was not zimmed.\n\nNow, let's try to infer the conclusion 'The flug was not blummed'. If the flug was not blummed, then it's possible that it was not zimmed either (since blumming and zimming are related). However, statement 2 only tells us that the flug might not have been zimmed, not that it definitely wasn't. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the flug was not blummed.\n\nAnswer: no",
