The splat might not have quanked.\n\nWe can analyze the first statement as a conditional statement, where \"the splat was morphed\" is the antecedent and \"the splat must have quanked\" is the consequent. This implies that if the splat was morphed, then it is necessary for the splat to have quanked.\n\nThe second statement, \"The splat might not have quanked\", suggests that there is a possibility that the splat did not quank.\n\nTo infer that \"The splat was not morphed\", we would need to conclude that the antecedent of the first statement (the splat being morphed) is false. However, we cannot directly conclude this from the given statements.\n\nThe first statement only implies that if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked. It does not provide any information about the possibility of the splat not being morphed. The second statement only suggests that the splat might not have quanked, but it does not provide any information about the morphing of the splat.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The splat was not morphed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
