The flob might not have movated\n\nWe are trying to infer whether the flob was not skizzled. To do this, we need to analyze the relationships between the statements.\n\nStatement 1 is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the flob was skizzled) is true, then the consequent (the flob must have movated) must also be true. However, this does not provide any information about the opposite case, i.e., if the antecedent is false.\n\nStatement 2 provides information about the possibility of the flob not having movated, but it does not provide any direct information about the flob being skizzled.\n\nTo infer that the flob was not skizzled, we would need to know that the flob did not movate, which is not given in the statements. We can only conclude that the flob might not have movated, but we cannot conclude that it was not skizzled.\n\nAnswer: no",
