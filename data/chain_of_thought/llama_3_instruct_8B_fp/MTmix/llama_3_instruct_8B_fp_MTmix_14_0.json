The clug might not have been snugged.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the clug was fleeked, then it must have been snugged. This implies that being fleeked is a sufficient condition for being snugged.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the clug might not have been snugged. This implies that the clug might not have been fleeked, since being fleeked is a sufficient condition for being snugged.\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude that the clug was not fleeked. The clug might have been fleeked, but not snugged. The statements do not provide enough information to rule out this possibility.\n\nAnswer: no",
