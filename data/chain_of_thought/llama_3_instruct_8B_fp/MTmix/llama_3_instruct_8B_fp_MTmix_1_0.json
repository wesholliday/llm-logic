The flugel might not have been zargled\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the flugel was blimmed, then it must have been zargled. This is a conditional statement, and the antecedent (if the flugel was blimmed) is not necessarily true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the flugel might not have been zargled, which means that the possibility of the flugel not being zargled is not ruled out.\n\nTo infer that the flugel was not blimmed, we would need to know that the flugel was not zargled, which is not given in the statements. We can't conclude that the flugel was not blimmed because the possibility of the flugel being blimmed and not zargled is not ruled out.\n\nAnswer: no",
