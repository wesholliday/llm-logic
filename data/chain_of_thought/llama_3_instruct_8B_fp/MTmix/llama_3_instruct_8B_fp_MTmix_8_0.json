The sprocket might not have been daggled.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled. However, this does not provide any information about the sprocket's cranking status when it was not daggled.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the sprocket might not have been daggled, but it does not provide any information about the sprocket's cranking status.\n\nWe cannot directly infer the sprocket's cranking status from the given statements. We cannot conclude that the sprocket was not cranked because we do not have enough information to rule out the possibility that the sprocket was cranked and then daggled.\n\nAnswer: no",
