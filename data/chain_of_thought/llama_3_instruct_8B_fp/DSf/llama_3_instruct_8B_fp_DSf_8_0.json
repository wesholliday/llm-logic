The second statement tells us that the remote control is not hiding under the couch. This means that the only remaining possibility is that the remote control is on the coffee table. Since the first statement states that the remote control is either under the couch or on the coffee table, and we have eliminated the possibility of it being under the couch, we can conclude that the remote control must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
