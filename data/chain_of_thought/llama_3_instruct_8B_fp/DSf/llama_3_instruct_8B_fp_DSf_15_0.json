From the first statement, we know that the shoes are either lined up by the door or in the closet. From the second statement, we know that the shoes are not lined up by the door. Therefore, we can conclude that the shoes must be in the closet, since the only other option is that they are lined up by the door, which is not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
