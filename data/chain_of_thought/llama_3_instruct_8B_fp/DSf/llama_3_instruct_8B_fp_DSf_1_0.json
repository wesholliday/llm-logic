            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside\" and \"Fido is not in the garden\". The first statement is a disjunction, which means it is true if at least one of the two options is true. The second statement is a negation, which means it is true if the opposite of the statement is true.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that Fido is not in the garden. This means that the first option in the disjunction, \"Fido is in the garden\", is false.\n\nSince the first option is false, the second option, \"Fido is inside\", must be true. This is because the disjunction is true if at least one of the options is true, and we have already established that the first option is false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
