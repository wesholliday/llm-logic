It implies that there is a relationship between the type of cake and the type of muffins. However, this statement does not provide any information about the relationship between the type of cake and the type of muffins when the cake is not chocolate.\n\nThe statement only provides information about the specific case where the cake is chocolate, and in that case, the muffins are blueberry. It does not provide any information about the other possible cases, such as when the cake is not chocolate.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry. There could be other possible combinations, such as the cake being vanilla and the muffins being blueberry, or the cake being red velvet and the muffins being blueberry, and so on.\n\nAnswer: no",
