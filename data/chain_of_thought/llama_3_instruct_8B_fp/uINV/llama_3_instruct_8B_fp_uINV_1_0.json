            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement, which means that it implies a relationship between Mary's presence at the wedding and Sue's presence at the wedding. The statement does not explicitly state that Mary's absence at the wedding implies Sue's absence, but it does imply that Mary's presence implies Sue's presence.\n\nTo infer that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding, we would need to know that the relationship between Mary and Sue is a one-to-one correspondence, meaning that if Mary is present, Sue is also present, and if Mary is absent, Sue is also absent. However, the original statement does not provide this information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
