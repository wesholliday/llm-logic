It implies that if the condition (the doll being plastic) is true, then the consequence (the truck being metal) is also true. However, this does not imply that if the condition is false, the consequence is also false.\n\nIn other words, just because the doll is not plastic, it does not necessarily mean that the truck is not metal. There could be other possibilities, such as the truck being metal even if the doll is not plastic.\n\nAnswer: no",
