            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is a conditional statement, which means that it implies a relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball. However, it does not imply a direct relationship between Tom not watching football and Jen not watching basketball. The statement only provides information about what happens when Tom watches football, not what happens when he doesn't. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
