It does not necessarily mean that the events are directly related, but rather that the occurrence of one event (the alien visiting Mars) is a sufficient condition for the other event (the robot visiting Jupiter) to occur.\n\nHowever, the statement does not provide any information about what happens when the alien does not visit Mars. It only provides information about what happens when the alien does visit Mars. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: no",
