            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement. It implies that if Lisa buys the red shirt, Mark will buy the blue shirt. However, it does not imply that if Lisa does not buy the red shirt, Mark will not buy the blue shirt. There could be other scenarios where Mark buys the blue shirt even if Lisa does not buy the red shirt.\n\nFor example, Mark might have already decided to buy the blue shirt before Lisa even considered buying the red shirt. In this case, Lisa not buying the red shirt would not affect Mark's decision to buy the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
