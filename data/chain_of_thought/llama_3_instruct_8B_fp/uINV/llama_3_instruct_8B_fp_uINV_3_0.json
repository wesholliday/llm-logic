This is a conditional statement, and it implies that there is a relationship between the author being James and the book being a mystery novel. However, it does not provide any information about the relationship between the author not being James and the book not being a mystery novel.\n\nTo infer that if the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel, we would need additional information that establishes a direct relationship between the author not being James and the book not being a mystery novel. The given statement only provides information about the relationship between the author being James and the book being a mystery novel, but it does not provide any information about the relationship between the author not being James and the book not being a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: no",
