            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement. It implies that there is a relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana. However, this relationship is not necessarily a direct cause-and-effect relationship. It's possible that there's a third variable that affects both the color of the apple and the color of the banana.\n\nThe original statement only provides information about what happens when the apple is red, but it doesn't provide information about what happens when the apple is not red. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that if the apple is not red, then the banana is not yellow.\n\nAnswer: no",
