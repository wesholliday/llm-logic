The \"if\" clause is the antecedent, and the \"then\" clause is the consequent. This statement does not imply that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race. The original statement only provides information about the relationship between the two events when both Alex and Chris finish the race, but it does not provide any information about the relationship when one or both of them do not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
