It does not provide any information about the relationship between Bob's choice and Sue's choice. To infer the statement \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\", we would need additional information or a similar conditional statement that establishes a relationship between Bob's choice and Sue's choice.\n\nThe original statement only tells us what happens when Sue chooses pizza, but it does not provide any information about what happens when Bob chooses pasta. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
