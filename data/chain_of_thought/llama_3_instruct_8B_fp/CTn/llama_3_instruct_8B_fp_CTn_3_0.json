This statement is saying that if the book was written by James, then it cannot be a mystery novel. This is a logical implication, not a direct statement.\n\nTo infer the converse, \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James\", we need to use the same logical implication. However, we cannot directly conclude that if the book is a mystery novel, then it was not written by James. The original statement only tells us that if the book was written by James, then it's not a mystery novel, but it doesn't provide any information about the relationship between being a mystery novel and being written by James.\n\nAnswer: no",
