            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement, \"If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow\". This statement is saying that if the apple is red, then the banana cannot be yellow. However, this does not imply that if the banana is yellow, then the apple is not red. The original statement only provides information about the relationship between the apple being red and the banana being yellow, but it does not provide any information about the relationship between the banana being yellow and the apple being red.\n\nThe original statement is saying that the apple and banana are mutually exclusive in terms of color, but it does not provide any information about the relationship between the banana being yellow and the apple being red. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the banana is yellow, then the apple is not red.\n\nAnswer: no",
