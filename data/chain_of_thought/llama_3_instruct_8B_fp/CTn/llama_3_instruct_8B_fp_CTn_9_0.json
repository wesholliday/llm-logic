            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement, \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt\". This means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, it is impossible for Mark to have bought the blue shirt. However, this does not necessarily mean that if Mark bought the blue shirt, Lisa did not buy the red shirt. There could be other possibilities, such as both Lisa and Mark buying different shirts.\n\nThe original statement only provides information about the relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt, but it does not provide any information about the relationship between Mark buying the blue shirt and Lisa buying the red shirt. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
