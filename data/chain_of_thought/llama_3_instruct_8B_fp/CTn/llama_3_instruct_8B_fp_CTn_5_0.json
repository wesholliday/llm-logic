However, this statement does not provide any information about the relationship between Amy playing tennis and Jeff playing basketball. The original statement only talks about the consequences of Jeff playing basketball, not the consequences of Amy playing tennis.\n\nTo infer the statement \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\", we would need additional information that establishes a relationship between Amy playing tennis and Jeff not playing basketball. The original statement does not provide this information, so we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
