This implies that the two events are mutually exclusive, meaning that if one of them occurs, the other cannot. However, this does not necessarily mean that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding. The original statement only provides information about the relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's absence, not the reverse.\n\nAnswer: no",
