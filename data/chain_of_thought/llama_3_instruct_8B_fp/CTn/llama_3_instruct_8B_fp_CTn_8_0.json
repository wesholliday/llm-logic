The statement is saying that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy cannot be awake at the same time. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the mummy is awake, then the vampire cannot be awake. The statement only provides information about the relationship between the two conditions when the vampire is awake, not when the mummy is awake.\n\nThe original statement does not provide any information about the relationship between the two conditions when the mummy is awake. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the mummy is awake, then the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
