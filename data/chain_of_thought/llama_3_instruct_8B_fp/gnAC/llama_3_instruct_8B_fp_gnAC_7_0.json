Chris finished the race (conclusion)\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that Alex finishing the race is a sufficient condition for Chris finishing the race. However, this does not necessarily mean that Alex finishing the race is a necessary condition for Chris finishing the race.\n\nIn other words, Chris finishing the race could be due to other reasons, not necessarily because Alex finished the race. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alex finished the race solely based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
