The conditional statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" implies that if the antecedent (the apple being red) is true, then the consequent (the banana being yellow) must also be true. However, this does not guarantee that the antecedent is true. The categorical statement \"The banana was yellow\" only tells us that the consequent is true, but it does not provide any information about the antecedent.\n\nIn other words, the truth of the consequent (the banana being yellow) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (the apple being red). There could be other reasons why the banana is yellow, unrelated to the apple being red.\n\nAnswer: no",
