The conditional statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" implies that if Tom watched football, Jen watched basketball. This does not imply that if Jen watched basketball, Tom watched football. The categorical statement \"Jen watched basketball\" only tells us that Jen watched basketball, but it does not provide any information about Tom's activity.
