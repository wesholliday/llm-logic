The conditional statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" implies that if the car is red, the truck must be blue. However, it does not imply that if the truck is blue, the car must be red. The categorical statement \"The truck was blue\" only tells us that the truck is indeed blue, but it does not provide any information about the color of the car. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the car is red solely based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
