The conditional statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" implies that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. However, it does not imply that if the muffins are blueberry, then the cake must be chocolate. The categorical statement \"The muffins were blueberry\" only tells us that the muffins are indeed blueberry, but it does not provide any information about the cake. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the cake is necessarily chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
