The book is a mystery novel (Statement)\n\nWe need to determine if the original statement \"The book was written by James\" can be logically concluded from the given statements.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the book is indeed a mystery novel. However, this does not provide any direct information about who wrote the book. The implication in statement 1 only tells us that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. It does not provide any information about the converse, i.e., if the book is a mystery novel, then it was written by James.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that \"The book was written by James\" is true solely based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
