The conditional statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" implies that if Mary was at the wedding, it is necessary for Sue to be at the wedding. This does not mean that if Sue is at the wedding, Mary must be at the wedding. The categorical statement \"Sue was at the wedding\" simply states that Sue was indeed at the wedding, but it does not provide any information about Mary's presence. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Mary was at the wedding solely based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
