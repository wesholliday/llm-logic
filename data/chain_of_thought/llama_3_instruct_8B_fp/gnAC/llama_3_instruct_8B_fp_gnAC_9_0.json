            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are conditional and categorical statements, respectively. The conditional statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, it is a necessary condition for Mark to buy the blue shirt. However, it does not imply that Lisa bought the red shirt is a sufficient condition for Mark to buy the blue shirt. The categorical statement \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" only tells us that Mark bought the blue shirt, but it does not provide any information about Lisa's action. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
