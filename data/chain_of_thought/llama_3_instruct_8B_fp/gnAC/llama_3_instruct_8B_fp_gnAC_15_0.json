The conditional statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" implies that if Sam took a plane, Erin took a train. This does not necessarily mean that if Erin took a train, Sam took a plane. The categorical statement \"Erin took a train\" only tells us that Erin took a train, but it does not provide any information about Sam's mode of transportation. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: no",
