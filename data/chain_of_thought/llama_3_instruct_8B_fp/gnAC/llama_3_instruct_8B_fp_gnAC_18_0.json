            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are conditional and categorical statements. The conditional statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" implies that if the antecedent (the doll being plastic) is true, then the consequent (the truck being metal) must also be true. The categorical statement \"The truck was metal\" is a separate statement that asserts the truth of the consequent. However, the truth of the consequent does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent.\n\nIn this case, we know that the truck was metal, but we cannot conclude that the doll was plastic. The conditional statement only establishes a relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal, but it does not provide a direct link between the truck being metal and the doll being plastic.\n\nAnswer: no",
