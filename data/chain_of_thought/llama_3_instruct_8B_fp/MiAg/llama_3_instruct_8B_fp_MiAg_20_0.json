The word \"might\" is used to indicate possibility, and since the scientist is in the lab, it is likely that the experiment is taking place in the lab. The two actions (being in the lab and conducting an experiment) are closely related, and it is reasonable to assume that the experiment is happening in the same location where the scientist is present.\n\nAnswer: yes",
