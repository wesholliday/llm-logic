This statement implies that when the sneg is crampled, it sproted the frink. However, it does not provide information about what happens when the sneg is not crampled.\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink\", we would need additional information or a specific rule that states that when the sneg is not crampled, it does not sprot the frink. The original statement does not provide this information, so we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
