            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\" is a conditional statement, which means that it implies a relationship between the two conditions \"plooked\" and \"nugged\". The statement is saying that if the shank is plooked, then it is also nugged. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the shank is not plooked, then it is not nugged.\n\nThe original statement does not provide any information about what happens when the shank is not plooked. It only talks about the relationship between being plooked and being nugged, but it does not provide any information about the relationship between not being plooked and not being nugged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged\" based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
