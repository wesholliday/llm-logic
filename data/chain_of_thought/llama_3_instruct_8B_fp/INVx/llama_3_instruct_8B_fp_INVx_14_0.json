This does not necessarily mean that the absence of the condition \"the clug was not fleeked\" is sufficient for the absence of the consequence \"the clug was not snugged\".\n\nIn other words, just because the clug snugged when it was fleeked, it does not necessarily mean that it did not snuggle when it was not fleeked. There could be other reasons why the clug snugged, and the absence of the condition \"fleeked\" does not necessarily imply the absence of the consequence \"snugged\".\n\nAnswer: no",
