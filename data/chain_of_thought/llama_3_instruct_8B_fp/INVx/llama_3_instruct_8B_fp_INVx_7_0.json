The statement is saying that if the whiffle was shanked, then it necessarily follows that the whiffle tinked. This is a logical implication, and we can use it to infer the converse statement.\n\nThe converse statement \"If the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink\" is a conditional statement that is logically equivalent to the original statement. If the whiffle was not shanked, then it is not possible for it to have tinked, since the tinking is a direct result of the shanking.\n\nAnswer: yes",
