            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" is a conditional statement, which means that it implies a relationship between the two events. The \"if\" clause (the antecedent) is the condition, and the \"then\" clause (the consequent) is the result. In this case, the statement is saying that if the sprocket is cranked, then it is also daggled.\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled\", we would need to know that the relationship between cranking and daggling is a one-to-one correspondence, meaning that if the sprocket is cranked, it is always daggled, and if it is not cranked, it is never daggled.\n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide this information. It only tells us that if the sprocket is cranked, it is daggled, but it does not rule out the possibility that the sprocket could be daggled without being cranked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no",
