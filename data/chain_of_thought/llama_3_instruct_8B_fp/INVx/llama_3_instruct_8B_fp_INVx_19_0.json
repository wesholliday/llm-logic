            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement, \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\". This statement implies that there is a relationship between the two events, where if the smonk was vreebled, then it must have been plagged. This is a logical implication, as the statement is stating that the two events are causally related.\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged\", we need to apply the same logical implication. If the smonk being vreebled is a necessary condition for it to be plagged, then it follows that if the smonk is not vreebled, it cannot be plagged. This is because the absence of the necessary condition (not being vreebled) implies the absence of the consequent (not being plagged).\n\nAnswer: yes",
