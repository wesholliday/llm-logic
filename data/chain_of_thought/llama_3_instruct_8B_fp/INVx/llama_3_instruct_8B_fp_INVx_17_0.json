This means that if the flob was not skizzled, then it is not possible for the flob to have movated. However, this does not necessarily mean that the flob was not movated, as there could be other reasons why the flob movated. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the flob was not skizzled, then the flob was not movated\".\n\nAnswer: no",
