            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" is an if-then statement, which implies a causal relationship between the two events. The statement is saying that if the splat was morphed, it necessarily leads to the splat quanking. This is a logical implication, and we can use it to make an inference about the opposite scenario.\n\nIf the splat was not morphed, then it did not undergo the morphing process. Since the morphing process is the necessary condition for the splat to quank, if the splat was not morphed, it did not quank. This is a logical consequence of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
