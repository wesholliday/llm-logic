In this case, the antecedent is \"the zinger was fraggled\" and the consequent is \"the zinger was smoogled\". This implies that if the zinger was indeed fraggled, then it must also have been smoogled.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that if the zinger was not fraggled, then it was not smoogled. There could be other possibilities where the zinger was not fraggled but was still smoogled. The original statement only provides information about the relationship between being fraggled and being smoogled, but it does not provide information about the relationship between not being fraggled and not being smoogled.\n\nAnswer: no",
