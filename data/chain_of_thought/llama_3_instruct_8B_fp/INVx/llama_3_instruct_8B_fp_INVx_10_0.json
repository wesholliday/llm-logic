            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement, which means it is saying that if a certain condition is met (the wug was sproinged), then a certain consequence follows (it was garpled). This type of statement is called a material implication, and it can be read as \"if-then\" or \"if and only if\".\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled\", we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is a statement that is logically equivalent to the original statement, but with the antecedent and consequent swapped and the negations of both.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement would be \"If it was not garpled, then it was not sproinged\". This statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, and it can be read as \"if-then\" or \"if and only if\".\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer that the statement \"If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
