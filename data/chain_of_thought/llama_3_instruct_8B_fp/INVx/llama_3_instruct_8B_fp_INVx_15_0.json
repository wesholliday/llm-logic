This means that if the condition \"the dreb was vroombed\" is true, then the conclusion \"the dreb was spened\" must also be true. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the condition is false, the conclusion is also false.\n\nIn other words, the implication only provides a guarantee that if the condition is true, the conclusion will also be true. It does not provide any information about what happens when the condition is false.\n\nTo infer \"If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened\", we would need additional information or a separate implication that establishes a direct relationship between the negation of the condition and the negation of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
