The conclusion is trying to negate the first premise, which is a conditional statement. To do this, the argument is using the second premise to create a contradiction with the first premise.\n\nHowever, the argument is not logically valid because it is using the second premise to create a contradiction with the first premise, but it is not using the first premise to conclude that the cake is not chocolate. The first premise only states that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry, but it does not state that if the muffins are not blueberry, then the cake is not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
