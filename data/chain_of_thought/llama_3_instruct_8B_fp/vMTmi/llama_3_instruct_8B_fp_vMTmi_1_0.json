            "content": "Explanation: The argument is trying to conclude that Mary was not at the wedding based on the premises that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding, and Sue might not have been at the wedding. The conclusion is trying to negate the first premise, which is a conditional statement. The second premise is a possibility statement about Sue's attendance.\n\nThe problem with this argument is that it is trying to use the possibility of Sue not being at the wedding to conclude that Mary was not at the wedding. However, the possibility of Sue not being at the wedding does not provide any information about Mary's attendance. The first premise only tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there, but it does not tell us anything about Mary's attendance in the absence of Sue's attendance.\n\nAnswer: no",
