            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box\" and \"The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor\". From the first statement, we know that there are only two possibilities for the location of the missing puzzle piece: it is either on the floor or in the box. The second statement tells us that the first possibility (it being on the floor) is not true, since the puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor. Therefore, we can conclude that the second possibility (it being in the box) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
