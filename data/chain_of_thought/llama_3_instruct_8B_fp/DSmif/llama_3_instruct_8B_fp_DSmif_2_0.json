The book might not be resting on the table.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the book is either on the table or on the shelf. From statement 2, we know that the book might not be on the table. This does not necessarily mean that the book is on the shelf. The book could be on the shelf, but it could also be in some other location.\n\nWe cannot infer that the book is on the shelf because the possibility of the book being on the shelf is not exclusive. The book could be in some other location, and we have no information to rule out that possibility.\n\nAnswer: no",
