The pen might not be on my desk.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the pen is either on the desk or in the bag. From statement 2, we know that the pen might not be on the desk. This does not necessarily mean that the pen is in the bag. The pen could be in neither the desk nor the bag.\n\nHowever, we can conclude that the pen is not on the desk, but we cannot infer that it is in the bag. The pen could be in some other location.\n\nAnswer: no",
