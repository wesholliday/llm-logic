The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the toy is either on the bookshelf or in the toy box. From statement 2, we know that the toy might not be on the bookshelf. This does not necessarily mean that the toy is in the toy box, as it could be in some other location.\n\nHowever, we can conclude that the toy is not on the bookshelf, but we cannot conclude that it is in the toy box. The toy could be in some other location, such as on the floor or in a different room.\n\nAnswer: no",
