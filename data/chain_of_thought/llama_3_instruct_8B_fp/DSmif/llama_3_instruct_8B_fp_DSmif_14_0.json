The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the milk is either in the fridge or on the counter. From statement 2, we know that the milk might not be in the fridge. This implies that the milk could be on the counter.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer that the milk is on the counter. The statements only provide possibilities, but not a definite conclusion. The milk could still be in the fridge, even though it might not be.\n\nAnswer: no",
