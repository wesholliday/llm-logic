The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the zinger being fraggled) is true, then the consequence (the zinger being smoogled) must also be true. However, the first statement tells us that the condition (the zinger being fraggled) is actually false. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the consequence (the zinger being smoogled) is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
