            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"The dreb was not vroombed\" and \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\". We can use the second statement to create a conditional statement: \"If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened\". This is because if the dreb was not vroombed, then it cannot be spened (since spened is only possible if vroombed). We can then use the first statement to conclude that the dreb was not spened.\n\nAnswer: yes",
