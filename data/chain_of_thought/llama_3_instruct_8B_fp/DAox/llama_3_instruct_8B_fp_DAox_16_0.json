We want to infer whether \"The sneg did not sprot the frink\" is true.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the sneg was not crampled. This gives us a negative condition.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement. It says that if the sneg was crampled, then it sproted the frink. This implies that if the sneg was not crampled, it did not sprot the frink.\n\nWe can combine these two pieces of information to conclude that the sneg did not sprot the frink. This is because the sneg was not crampled, and if it was not crampled, it did not sprot the frink.\n\nAnswer: yes",
