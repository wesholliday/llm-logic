            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"The flob was not skizzled\" and \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\". We can use the first statement to create a conditional statement: \"If the flob was skizzled, then it is not the case that the flob was not skizzled\". This is because if the flob was skizzled, then it cannot also be the case that it was not skizzled. We can then combine this with the second statement: \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\" to get: \"If the flob was skizzled, then it is not the case that the flob was not skizzled and the flob movated\". This is equivalent to: \"If the flob was not movated, then it is not the case that the flob was skizzled\". This is a contrapositive statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we can conclude that if the flob was not movated, then it was not skizzled. We can then use the first statement again: \"The flob was not skizzled\" to conclude that the flob was not movated.\n\nAnswer: yes",
