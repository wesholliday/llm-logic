We can analyze these statements to see if we can infer the conclusion \"The clug was not snugged\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the clug is not fleeked. From the second statement, we know that if the clug were fleeked, it would snugged. However, we are told that the clug is not fleeked, so it cannot be the case that the clug snugged. This is because the condition for the clug to snugged (i.e., being fleeked) is not met.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the clug did not snugged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
