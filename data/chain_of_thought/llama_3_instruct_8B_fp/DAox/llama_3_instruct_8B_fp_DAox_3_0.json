We want to infer whether \"The splat did not quank\" is true.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the splat was not morphed. This gives us a negative condition.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement. It says that if the splat was morphed, then it quanked. This implies that if the splat was not morphed, it would not quank.\n\nWe can combine these two statements to conclude that the splat did not quank. If the splat was not morphed, it would not quank, and since we know it was not morphed, it did not quank.\n\nAnswer: yes",
