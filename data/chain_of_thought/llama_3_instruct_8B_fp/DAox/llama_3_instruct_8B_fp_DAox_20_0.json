We can analyze these statements to see if we can infer the conclusion \"The fleeg did not surn\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the fleeg is not bluttered. From the second statement, we know that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it would surn. However, we don't know the current state of the fleeg's surning. It could be surning or not surning.\n\nTo infer the conclusion \"The fleeg did not surn\", we would need to know that the fleeg's surning is dependent on it being bluttered. But the statements don't provide that information. We can't conclude that the fleeg's surning is necessarily related to its bluttering.\n\nAnswer: no",
