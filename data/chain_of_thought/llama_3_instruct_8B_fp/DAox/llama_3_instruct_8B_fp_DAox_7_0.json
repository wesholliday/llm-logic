We want to infer whether \"The whiffle did not tink\" is true or not.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the whiffle was not shanked. This gives us a negative condition.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that if the whiffle was shanked, then it tinked. This gives us a conditional relationship between shanking and tinking.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. If the whiffle was not shanked (as stated in the first statement), then it cannot be the case that it tinked (because tinking is conditional on shanking). Therefore, we can conclude that the whiffle did not tink.\n\nAnswer: yes",
