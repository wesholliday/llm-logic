We want to know if we can infer that \"The sprocket was not daggled\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the sprocket was not cranked. From the second statement, we know that if the sprocket was cranked, then it would be daggled. However, we don't know if the sprocket was cranked or not. We only know that it was not cranked.\n\nSince we don't know if the sprocket was cranked or not, we can't conclude that it was not daggled. The sprocket might have been cranked, in which case it would be daggled, or it might not have been cranked, in which case it wouldn't be daggled. We just don't have enough information to make a conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
