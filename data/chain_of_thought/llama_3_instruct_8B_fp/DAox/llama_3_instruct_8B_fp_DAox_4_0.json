The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the fribble being snurgled) is true, then the consequence (the fribble crinked) must also be true. However, the first statement tells us that the condition is not true (the fribble was not snurgled). Therefore, we cannot conclude that the consequence is true, as the condition is not met.\n\nAnswer: no",
