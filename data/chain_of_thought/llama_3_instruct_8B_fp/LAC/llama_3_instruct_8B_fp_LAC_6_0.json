However, this does not provide any direct information about Sue's choice. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it only provides information about Sue's choice if a certain condition is met. In this case, the condition is that Bob chose pasta.\n\nSince we only know that Bob chose pasta, but not that Sue chose pizza, we cannot logically infer that Sue chose pizza. The condition in the first statement is not met, and therefore, we cannot conclude anything about Sue's choice.\n\nAnswer: no",
