Erin took a train\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. This is a conditional statement, and it does not directly imply that Sam took a plane. The condition is not fulfilled, and we do not have any information about Sam's mode of transportation.\n\nStatement 2 only tells us that Erin took a train, but it does not provide any information about Sam's mode of transportation. We cannot logically infer that Sam took a plane because there is no direct connection between Erin's mode of transportation and Sam's mode of transportation.\n\nAnswer: no",
