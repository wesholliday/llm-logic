The pants were denim\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the pants are indeed denim. However, this information does not provide any direct evidence about the material of the shirt. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it only provides information about the shirt's material if the condition is met. In this case, the condition is \"the shirt was cotton\", which is not explicitly stated.\n\nWe cannot logically infer that the shirt was cotton because the second statement only provides information about the pants, not the shirt. The first statement is a conditional statement that requires additional information to be triggered, which is not provided in the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
