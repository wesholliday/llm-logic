            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Sue was at the wedding\". The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true. The second statement is a categorical statement, which simply states that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nTo infer that Mary was at the wedding, we need to use the first statement and the second statement together. We can do this by using the first statement to conclude that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary must have been at the wedding as well. This is because the first statement establishes a logical connection between Mary's presence and Sue's presence.\n\nHowever, we are also given the second statement, which explicitly states that Sue was at the wedding. This means that we can use the second statement to conclude that Sue was indeed at the wedding. And since the first statement tells us that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary must have been at the wedding as well, we can logically infer that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
