The unicorn was in the forest\n\nWe want to know if we can logically infer that the griffin was in the forest. To do this, we need to apply the first statement to the second statement.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means it says that if a certain condition is met (the griffin is in the forest), then another condition is also met (the unicorn is in the forest). The second statement says that the unicorn is in the forest.\n\nSince the second statement matches the condition mentioned in the first statement (the unicorn is in the forest), we can apply the first statement to the second statement. This means we can conclude that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nHowever, this does not directly tell us that the griffin was in the forest. We can only conclude that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. We cannot conclude that the griffin was in the forest without additional information.\n\nAnswer: no",
