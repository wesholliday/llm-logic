We want to know if we can logically infer \"The book was written by James\".\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means it says that if a certain condition is met (the book was written by James), then a certain consequence will follow (the book is a mystery novel). The second statement is a categorical statement, which simply states a fact (the book is a mystery novel).\n\nTo logically infer \"The book was written by James\", we need to use the first statement and the second statement together. We can do this by using the modus ponens rule, which states that if we have a conditional statement and its consequent, we can logically infer the antecedent.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\", and the consequent is \"The book is a mystery novel\". Therefore, we can logically infer \"The book was written by James\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
