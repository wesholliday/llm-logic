However, the subsequent statement \"Also, the missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor\" adds a new dimension to the situation. This statement acknowledges that the piece might not be on the floor, which means we can't rule out the possibility that it's actually in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
