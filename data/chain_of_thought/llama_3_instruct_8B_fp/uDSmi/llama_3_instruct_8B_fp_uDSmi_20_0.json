The additional statement \"Also, the sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" adds a nuance, suggesting that the possibility of the sunglasses being perched on her head is not certain. However, this does not necessarily imply that the sunglasses are in her bag. The statement does not provide any information that would rule out the possibility of the sunglasses being in a third location or not being present at all.\n\nAnswer: no",
