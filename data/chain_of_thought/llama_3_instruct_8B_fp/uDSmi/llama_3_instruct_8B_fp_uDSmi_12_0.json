This implies that these are the only two possible locations for the jacket. The additional information that the jacket might not be hanging in the closet does not provide any new information about the jacket's location. Therefore, we can conclude that if the jacket is not hanging in the closet, it must be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
