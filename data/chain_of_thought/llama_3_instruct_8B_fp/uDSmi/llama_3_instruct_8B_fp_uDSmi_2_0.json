This means that the book cannot be on the shelf and resting on the table at the same time. The second statement \"the book might not be resting on the table\" adds a new possibility, which is that the book is not resting on the table. However, this does not provide any information about the book's location. The only conclusion we can draw is that the book is either on the shelf or not resting on the table, but we cannot infer that the book is specifically on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: no",
