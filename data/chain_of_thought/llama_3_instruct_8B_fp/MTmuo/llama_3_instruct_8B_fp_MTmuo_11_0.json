The first statement \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry\" implies that the muffins might not have been blueberry. The second statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry\" implies that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would have been blueberry. However, this does not imply that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins would not have been blueberry. We cannot conclude that the cake was not chocolate because the muffins might still have been blueberry even if the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
