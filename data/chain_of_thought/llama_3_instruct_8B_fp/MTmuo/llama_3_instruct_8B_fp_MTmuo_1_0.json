The first statement tells us that Sue's presence at the wedding is not necessarily, it's not a requirement. The second statement tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue's presence is a requirement. We can infer that Sue's presence is not a requirement, but it's not necessarily the case that Sue was not at the wedding. We can't conclude that Mary was not at the wedding because the second statement only tells us what happens if Mary is at the wedding, not what happens if she's not.\n\nAnswer: no",
