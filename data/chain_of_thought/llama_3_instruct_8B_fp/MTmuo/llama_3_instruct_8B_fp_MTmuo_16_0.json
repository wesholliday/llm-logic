The first statement \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim\" implies that the pants could have been something other than denim. The second statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\" implies that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. However, this does not provide any information about the pants when the shirt is not cotton.\n\nWe cannot infer that the shirt was not cotton because the shirt could be cotton and the pants could be something other than denim. The statements do not provide any information about the shirt when the pants are not denim.\n\nAnswer: no",
