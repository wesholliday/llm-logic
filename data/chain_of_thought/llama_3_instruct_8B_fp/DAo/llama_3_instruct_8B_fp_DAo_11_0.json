We want to know if we can infer that \"The muffins were not blueberry\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the cake is not chocolate. This gives us no information about the muffins.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means it only talks about the relationship between the cake and the muffins if the cake is indeed chocolate. Since we know the cake is not chocolate, this statement does not apply to our situation.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer anything about the muffins, including whether they are blueberry or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
