            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"The apple was not red\" and \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\". We want to know if we can infer \"The banana was not yellow\". To do this, we need to analyze the given statements and see if we can logically conclude the desired statement.\n\nFrom the first statement, \"The apple was not red\", we know that the apple is not red. This gives us no information about the banana.\n\nThe second statement, \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\", is a conditional statement. It says that if the apple was red, then the banana would be yellow. However, this statement does not provide any information about the banana's color if the apple is not red.\n\nSince the first statement only tells us about the apple's color, and the second statement only provides information about the banana's color under a specific condition (if the apple is red), we cannot logically conclude anything about the banana's color.\n\nAnswer: no",
