We want to know if we can infer \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it only talks about the situation where Lisa bought the red shirt. Since Lisa did not buy the red shirt, the second statement does not apply to our situation.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer anything about Mark's purchase of the blue shirt from these two statements. We don't have enough information to make a conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
