We want to know if we can infer \"The cat was not outside\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know the dog is not inside. From the second statement, we know that if the dog was inside, the cat would be outside. But since the dog is not inside, it doesn't matter what the cat is doing. The second statement doesn't provide any information about the cat's location when the dog is not inside.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer anything about the cat's location, including whether it was outside or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
