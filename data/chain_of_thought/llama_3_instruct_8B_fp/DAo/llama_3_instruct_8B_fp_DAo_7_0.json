We want to know if we can infer \"Chris did not finish the race\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Alex did not finish the race. From the second statement, we know that if Alex had finished the race, Chris would have finished the race as well. However, since Alex did not finish the race, it is not possible to determine whether Chris finished the race or not.\n\nWe cannot conclude that Chris did not finish the race because there is no information about Chris's finishing status. The statements only provide information about Alex's finishing status, but not about Chris's.\n\nAnswer: no",
