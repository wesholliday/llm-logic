We want to know if we can infer \"The truck was not blue\". To do this, we need to analyze the given statements and see if we can logically conclude the desired statement.\n\nFrom the first statement, \"The car was not red\", we know that the car's color is not red. However, this statement does not provide any information about the truck's color.\n\nThe second statement, \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\", is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the car were red, then the truck would be blue. However, this statement does not tell us what would happen if the car were not red. It only provides information about the truck's color if the car were red.\n\nSince the first statement tells us that the car is not red, we cannot apply the second statement to conclude anything about the truck's color. We cannot say that the truck is blue or not blue based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
