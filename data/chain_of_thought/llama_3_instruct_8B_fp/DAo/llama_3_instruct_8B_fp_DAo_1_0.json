            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"Mary was not at the wedding\" and \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\". The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it only talks about the situation where Mary is at the wedding. It does not provide any information about the situation where Mary is not at the wedding.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Mary was not at the wedding. But this does not give us any direct information about Sue's presence at the wedding. The second statement only talks about the situation where Mary is at the wedding, and it does not provide any information about the situation where Mary is not at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sue was not at the wedding. We only know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding, but we do not know what happened when Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
