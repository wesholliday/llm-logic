The second statement says that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. We want to know if we can infer that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the book was not written by James. This gives us a negative piece of information about the author.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement. It says that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. This means that if the book was written by James, we would know that it is a mystery novel. But we know that the book was not written by James, so this condition is not met.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that the book is not a mystery novel. We only know that the book was not written by James, but we don't have any information about the book's genre.\n\nAnswer: no",
