We want to know if we can infer that \"The pants were not denim\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the shirt is not cotton. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it only talks about the situation where the shirt is cotton. Since the shirt is not cotton, the second statement does not apply to our situation.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not provide any information about the pants when the shirt is not cotton. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the pants being denim or not denim.\n\nAnswer: no",
