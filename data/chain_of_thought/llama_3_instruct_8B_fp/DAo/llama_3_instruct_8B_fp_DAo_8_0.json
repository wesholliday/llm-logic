We can use the first statement to conclude that the vampire is not awake. However, we cannot directly conclude that the mummy is not awake from the given statements.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means it only provides information about the relationship between the vampire's wakefulness and the mummy's wakefulness. It does not provide any direct information about the mummy's wakefulness.\n\nTo conclude that the mummy is not awake, we would need additional information or another statement that directly relates to the mummy's wakefulness. The given statements do not provide enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
