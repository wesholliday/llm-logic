We want to know if we can infer \"Erin did not take a train\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Sam did not take a plane. From the second statement, we know that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. However, since Sam did not take a plane, we cannot conclude that Erin took a train.\n\nWe cannot directly infer that Erin did not take a train because there might be other possibilities. For example, Erin might have taken a train even if Sam did not take a plane. We need more information to conclude that Erin did not take a train.\n\nAnswer: no",
