            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are conditional and categorical statements. The conditional statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, it is necessary for Mark to buy the blue shirt. The categorical statement \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a fact that has occurred. We can use modus ponens, a valid argument form, to conclude that if the antecedent of the conditional statement is true, then the consequent must also be true. In this case, the antecedent is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\", and the consequent is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\". Since \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a fact, we can conclude that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
