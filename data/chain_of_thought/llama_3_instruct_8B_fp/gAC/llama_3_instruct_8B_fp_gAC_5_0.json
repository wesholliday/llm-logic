The conditional statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" implies that if Jeff played basketball, Amy played tennis. The categorical statement \"Amy played tennis\" is a fact. We need to determine if the fact \"Amy played tennis\" logically follows from the conditional statement and the assumption that Jeff played basketball.\n\nFrom the conditional statement, we know that if Jeff played basketball, Amy played tennis. Since Amy played tennis, it is possible that Jeff played basketball, but it is also possible that Jeff did not play basketball. The fact that Amy played tennis does not provide enough information to conclude that Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
