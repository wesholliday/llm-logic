Erin took a train (factual statement)\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Sam took a plane) is true, then the consequence (Erin took a train) must also be true.\n\nStatement 2, \"Erin took a train\", is a factual statement that confirms the consequence of the conditional statement. Since Erin took a train, we know that the condition \"Sam took a plane\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
