The conditional statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" implies that if the antecedent (the doll being plastic) is true, then the consequent (the truck being metal) must also be true. The categorical statement \"The truck was metal\" is a separate statement that asserts the truth of the consequent. Since the consequent is true, we can infer that the antecedent must also be true, but only if the conditional statement is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
