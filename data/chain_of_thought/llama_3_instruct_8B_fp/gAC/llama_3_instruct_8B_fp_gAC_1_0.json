The conditional statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" implies that if Mary was at the wedding, it is necessary for Sue to be at the wedding. The categorical statement \"Sue was at the wedding\" states that Sue was indeed at the wedding. Since the conditional statement implies that Sue's presence is necessary for Mary's presence, and we know that Sue was at the wedding, it follows that Mary must have been at the wedding as well.",
