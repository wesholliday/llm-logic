It means that if the antecedent (the apple being red) is true, then the consequent (the banana being yellow) must also be true. The second statement \"The banana was yellow\" is a categorical statement that asserts the truth of the consequent. Since the consequent is true, we can conclude that the antecedent must also be true. This is because the conditional statement guarantees that if the consequent is true, the antecedent must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
