This means that if Alex finished the race, Chris must have also finished the race.\n\nNow, statement 2 tells us that Chris did finish the race. Since we know that if Alex finished the race, Chris must have also finished the race, we can conclude that Alex must have also finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
