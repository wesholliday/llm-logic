The second statement \"Bob chose pasta\" is a categorical statement that asserts that Bob did indeed choose pasta.\n\nSince the conditional statement is true, and the consequent (Bob chose pasta) is also true, we can conclude that the antecedent (Sue chose pizza) must also be true. This is because the conditional statement implies that if Bob chose pasta, then Sue must have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
