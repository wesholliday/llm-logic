It means that if the condition (the vampire being awake) is true, then the consequence (the mummy being awake) must also be true. However, this does not mean that the condition is necessarily true. The statement only guarantees that if the condition is true, the consequence will also be true.\n\nThe second statement \"The mummy was awake\" is a separate statement that provides additional information. It tells us that the consequence (the mummy being awake) is indeed true.\n\nFrom this information, we cannot directly conclude that the condition (the vampire being awake) is true. We only know that if the condition were true, the consequence would also be true, and we know that the consequence is true. But we don't know if the condition is true or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
