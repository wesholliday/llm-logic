            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" and \"The cat was outside\". We need to determine if it follows that \"The dog was inside\" is true. To do this, we can use the principle of modus ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, then we can conclude that B is true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\". We know that the cat was outside, which means that the second part of the conditional statement is true. Therefore, we can apply modus ponens and conclude that the first part of the conditional statement must also be true, which is \"The dog was inside\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
