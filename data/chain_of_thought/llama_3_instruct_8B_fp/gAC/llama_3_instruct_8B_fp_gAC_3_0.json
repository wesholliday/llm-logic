The book is a mystery novel (assertion)\n\nWe need to determine if the original statement \"The book was written by James\" can be logically concluded from the given statements.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. This is a conditional statement, and the antecedent is \"the book was written by James\".\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the book is indeed a mystery novel.\n\nNow, we can use the conditional statement to draw a conclusion. Since the book is a mystery novel (statement 2), and if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel (statement 1), we can conclude that the antecedent \"the book was written by James\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
