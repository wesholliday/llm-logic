            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been signed and notarized\" implies that both conditions (being signed and being notarized) are necessary for the document to meet the requirement. The use of the conjunction \"and\" suggests that both conditions are required, and the absence of either one would mean the document does not meet the requirement. Therefore, we can infer that the document must have been notarized, but only if it was also signed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
