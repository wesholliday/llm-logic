            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The software must have been updated and restarted\" implies that the software was updated, and as a result, it was also restarted. The word \"and\" is used to connect the two actions, suggesting that they are related and occurred simultaneously. The phrase \"must have been\" is a grammatical construction that indicates a necessary condition, implying that the software was updated and restarted because it was necessary for the software to be in a certain state.
