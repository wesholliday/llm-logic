            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package must have been delivered yesterday or the day before\" is a disjunction, which means it presents two possibilities: either the package was delivered yesterday or it was delivered the day before. The statement does not explicitly rule out the possibility that the package was delivered on a different day. However, it does imply that the package was delivered on one of the two specified days. The question being asked is whether we can infer that the package was delivered specifically on yesterday, which is one of the two possibilities presented.\n\nAnswer: no",
