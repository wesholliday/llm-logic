            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a disjunction, which means it presents two alternatives: either the project must have been completed by Friday or it must have been extended. The word \"or\" is used to indicate that one of the two options is true, but not necessarily both. The statement does not provide any information that would suggest the project was not completed by Friday, but rather presents it as one of the two possible outcomes. Therefore, we cannot infer that the project must have been completed by Friday, as the statement also allows for the possibility that the project was extended.\n\nAnswer: no",
