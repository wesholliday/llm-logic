            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The event must have been formal or semi-formal\" is a disjunction, which means it presents two mutually exclusive options. \"Formal\" and \"semi-formal\" are two different levels of formality, with \"semi-formal\" being less formal than \"formal\". The statement does not explicitly rule out the possibility that the event was only semi-formal, it only provides two options. Therefore, we cannot infer that the event must have been formal, as it could have been semi-formal instead.\n\nAnswer: no",
