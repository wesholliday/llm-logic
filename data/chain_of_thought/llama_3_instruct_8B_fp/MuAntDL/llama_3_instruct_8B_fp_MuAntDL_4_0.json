            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM or cancelled\" is a disjunction, which means it presents two mutually exclusive options. The first option is that the meeting was at 2 PM, and the second option is that the meeting was cancelled. The use of \"or\" implies that one of these options must be true, but it does not necessarily mean that both options are true. The statement does not provide any additional information that would allow us to conclude that the meeting was indeed at 2 PM. We can only conclude that the meeting was either at 2 PM or cancelled, but we cannot infer which one is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
