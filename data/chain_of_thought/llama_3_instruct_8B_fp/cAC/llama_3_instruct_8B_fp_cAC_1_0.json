Sue was at the wedding\n\nWe can start by analyzing the first statement, which is an if-then statement. This means that if the condition \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true, then the conclusion \"Sue was at the wedding\" must also be true. However, this does not necessarily mean that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nThe second statement, \"Sue was at the wedding\", only tells us that Sue was indeed at the wedding, but it does not provide any information about Mary's presence at the wedding.\n\nSince we don't have any additional information that would allow us to conclude that Mary was at the wedding, we cannot logically conclude that Mary was at the wedding based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
