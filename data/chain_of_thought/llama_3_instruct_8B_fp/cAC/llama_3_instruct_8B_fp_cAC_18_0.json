            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are:\n\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\n2. The truck was metal\n\nWe can start by analyzing the first statement, which is an if-then statement. This statement is saying that if the condition \"the doll was plastic\" is true, then the consequence \"the truck was metal\" must also be true. However, this statement does not guarantee that the condition is true. It only provides a relationship between the condition and the consequence.\n\nThe second statement, \"The truck was metal\", is a separate statement that provides additional information. It does not provide any information about the doll.\n\nTo conclude that \"The doll was plastic\", we would need to know that the condition in the if-then statement is true. But we don't have that information. We only know that the consequence of the if-then statement is true, which is \"The truck was metal\".\n\nAnswer: no",
