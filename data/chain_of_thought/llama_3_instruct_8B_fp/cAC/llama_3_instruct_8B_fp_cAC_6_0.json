However, this does not directly tell us what Sue chose. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it only provides information about Sue's choice if a certain condition is met. In this case, the condition is \"Sue chose pizza\". Since we don't know if Sue chose pizza or not, we cannot conclude that Sue chose pizza.\n\nAnswer: no",
