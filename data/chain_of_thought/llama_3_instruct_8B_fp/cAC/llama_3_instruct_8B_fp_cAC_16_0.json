The pants were denim\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the pants are indeed denim. However, this does not provide any direct information about the shirt. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it only provides information about the shirt if the condition is met. In this case, the condition is \"the shirt was cotton\". Since we don't know if the shirt is cotton or not, we cannot conclude that the shirt is cotton.\n\nAnswer: no",
