The muffins were blueberry\n\nWe can see that statement 2 is a conclusion that can be drawn from statement 1, but it is not a direct statement about the cake. Statement 1 only tells us that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry, but it does not tell us anything about the cake itself.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that the cake was chocolate based solely on the given statements. We would need additional information to make a conclusion about the cake.\n\nAnswer: no",
