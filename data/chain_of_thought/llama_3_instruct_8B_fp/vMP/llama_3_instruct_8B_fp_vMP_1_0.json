            "content": "Explanation: This argument is an example of a categorical syllogism, specifically a modus ponens argument. The first premise is an \"if-then\" statement, which sets up a conditional relationship between Mary's presence at the wedding and Sue's presence. The second premise states that Mary was indeed at the wedding. The conclusion then logically follows that if Mary was at the wedding, and Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding as well. The argument is structured in a way that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true, making it logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
