            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" and \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\". The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true. The second statement is a possibility statement, which means that Sue's presence at the wedding is not certain.\n\nFrom these statements, we cannot directly infer that Mary was not at the wedding. The first statement only tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there, but it does not provide any information about Mary's presence at the wedding. The second statement only tells us that Sue's presence is possible, but it does not provide any information about Mary's presence.\n\nWe cannot conclude that Mary was not at the wedding because there is no direct evidence or logical connection between Mary's presence and Sue's presence. The statements only provide information about the relationship between Mary and Sue's presence at the wedding, but not about Mary's presence itself.\n\nAnswer: no",
