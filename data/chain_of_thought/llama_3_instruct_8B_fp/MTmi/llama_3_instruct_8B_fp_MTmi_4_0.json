The robot might not have visited Jupiter.\n\nWe are trying to infer whether the alien visited Mars or not. From statement 1, we can conclude that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter. However, statement 2 tells us that the robot might not have visited Jupiter, which means it's possible that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nSince the robot might not have visited Jupiter, it's possible that the alien did not visit Mars either. But we cannot conclude that the alien did not visit Mars with certainty. The alien might have visited Mars, and the robot just didn't visit Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: no",
