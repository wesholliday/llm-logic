            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are:\n\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n2. Lucy might not have gone to the zoo.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can conclude that if Joe went to the park, Lucy would have gone to the zoo. However, statement 2 says that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo, which means there is a possibility that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. If Lucy did not go to the zoo, it does not necessarily mean that Joe did not go to the park. The only condition is that Lucy would have gone to the zoo if Joe went to the park, but it does not imply that Joe's action is dependent on Lucy's action.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
