Kate might not have eaten salad\n\nFrom statement 1, we can conclude that if Ben ate pasta, Kate must have eaten salad. However, this does not imply that if Kate did not eat salad, Ben did not eat pasta. The statement only provides a conditional relationship between Ben's pasta eating and Kate's salad eating.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that Kate might not have eaten salad, which means it is possible that Kate did not eat salad. However, this does not provide any information about Ben's pasta eating. We cannot conclude that Ben did not eat pasta based on Kate's possible non-eating of salad.\n\nAnswer: no",
