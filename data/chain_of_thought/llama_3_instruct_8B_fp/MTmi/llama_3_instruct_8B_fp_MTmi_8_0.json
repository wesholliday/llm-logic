We want to know if we can infer \"The vampire was not awake\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake. This implies that the vampire's wakefulness is a sufficient condition for the mummy's wakefulness.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the mummy might not have been awake. This means that there is a possibility that the mummy was not awake, but it does not provide any information about the vampire's wakefulness.\n\nSince we don't have any information about the vampire's wakefulness, we cannot infer that the vampire was not awake. The statements do not provide a sufficient condition for the vampire's wakefulness, and we cannot conclude that the vampire was not awake based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
