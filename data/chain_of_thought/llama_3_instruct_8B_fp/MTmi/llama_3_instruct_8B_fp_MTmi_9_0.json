            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" and \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\". We want to know if we can infer \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This implies that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\n\nThe second statement tells us that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. This does not provide any information about Lisa's purchase of the red shirt.\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. The statements do not provide any information that would allow us to make such a conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
