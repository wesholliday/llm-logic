Erin might not have taken a train\n\nFrom statement 1, we can conclude that if Sam took a plane, Erin must have taken a train. However, this does not provide any information about what Erin did if Sam did not take a plane.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that Erin might not have taken a train, which means it is possible that Erin did not take a train. But this does not provide any information about what Sam did.\n\nWe cannot infer that Sam did not take a plane because the statements do not provide any information about Sam's actions if Erin did not take a train. The statements only provide information about the relationship between Sam's actions and Erin's actions under certain conditions, but do not provide any information about Sam's actions in general.\n\nAnswer: no",
