The truck might not have been blue\n\nFrom statement 1, we can conclude that if the car is red, then the truck is blue. However, this does not mean that if the truck is not blue, then the car is not red. The truck might not be blue for reasons unrelated to the car's color.\n\nStatement 2 only tells us that the truck might not be blue, but it does not provide any information about the car's color. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the car's color from statement 2.\n\nSince we cannot conclude anything about the car's color from the given statements, we cannot infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: no",
