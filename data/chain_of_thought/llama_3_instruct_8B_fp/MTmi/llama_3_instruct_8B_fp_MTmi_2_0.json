The unicorn might not have been in the forest\n\nFrom statement 1, we can conclude that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest. However, this does not provide any information about the griffin's presence in the forest when the unicorn might not have been there.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the unicorn might not have been in the forest, but it does not provide any information about the griffin's presence.\n\nWe cannot infer anything about the griffin's presence in the forest based on the given statements. We only know that if the griffin was in the forest, the unicorn was also in the forest, but we don't know if the griffin was actually in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no",
