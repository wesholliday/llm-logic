However, this does not mean that if the muffins are not blueberry, then the cake is not chocolate.\n\nThe second statement \"The muffins might not have been blueberry\" is a possibility, but it does not provide any information about the cake. It only tells us that the muffins could be something other than blueberry.\n\nTo infer that the cake was not chocolate, we would need more information that connects the muffins not being blueberry to the cake not being chocolate. Since we don't have that information, we cannot make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
