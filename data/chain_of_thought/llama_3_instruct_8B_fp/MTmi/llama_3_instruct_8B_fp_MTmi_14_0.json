The wolf might not have been in the den.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can conclude that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf is in the den. However, statement 2 says that the wolf might not have been in the den, which means there is a possibility that the wolf is not in the den.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. If the bear is in the cave, then the wolf must be in the den (from statement 1). But statement 2 says that the wolf might not be in the den. This means that the bear being in the cave does not necessarily mean that the wolf is in the den. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the bear is not in the cave just because the wolf might not be in the den.\n\nAnswer: no",
