The banana might not have been yellow\n\nFrom statement 1, we can conclude that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. However, this does not provide any information about the color of the apple if the banana is not yellow.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the banana might not have been yellow, which means there is a possibility that the banana was not yellow. However, this does not provide any information about the color of the apple.\n\nWe cannot infer the color of the apple (red or not red) based on the given statements. The statements only provide information about the relationship between the apple and banana colors, but not about the color of the apple itself.\n\nAnswer: no",
