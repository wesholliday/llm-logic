We want to infer whether \"The shank is plooked\" is true or not.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged. This means that the shank is either plooked or it is not plooked but must be nugged.\n\nThe first statement says that the shank might not be nugged. This means that the possibility of the shank not being nugged is not zero.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that the shank is not plooked (because if it were, it would have to be nugged, but it might not be nugged). Therefore, we cannot infer that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: no",
