We want to infer whether \"The smip is shripped\" is true or not.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped. This means that the smip is either shripped or it is lupped. However, the first statement tells us that the smip might not be lupped. This implies that the smip is not lupped.\n\nNow, we know that the smip is not lupped and it is either shripped or lupped. Therefore, the only possibility left is that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
