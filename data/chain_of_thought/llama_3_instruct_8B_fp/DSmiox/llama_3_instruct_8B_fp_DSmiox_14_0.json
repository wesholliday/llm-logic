From the first statement, we know that the possibility of the clug being snugged is not certain. From the second statement, we know that if the clug is not fleeked, it must be snugged. However, we cannot conclude that the clug is fleeked because there is another possibility: the clug might be fleeked, but we cannot rule out this possibility based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
