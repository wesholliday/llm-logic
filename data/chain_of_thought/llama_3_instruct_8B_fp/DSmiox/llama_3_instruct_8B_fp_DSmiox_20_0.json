We want to know if we can infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered\".\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned. This means that if the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered. The first statement tells us that the fleeg might not be surned, which means that there is a possibility that it is not surned.\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude that the fleeg is bluttered. The possibility that the fleeg is not surned does not necessarily mean that it is bluttered. There could be other possibilities that are not considered in the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
