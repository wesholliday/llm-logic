The phrase \"or\" is used to indicate that one of the two options might occur, but not necessarily both. The sentence does not imply that both actions will happen simultaneously. The phrase \"might\" is used to indicate possibility, not necessity. Therefore, we cannot infer that John will both clean his room and go to the lecture.\n\nAnswer: no",
