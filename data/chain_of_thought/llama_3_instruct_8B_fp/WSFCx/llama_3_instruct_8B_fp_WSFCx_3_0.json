This is an example of a disjunction, where two alternatives are presented as mutually exclusive. The sentence is saying that the plonk is either on the zibble or in the snork, but not both. The use of \"or\" implies that the two possibilities are exhaustive, meaning that one of them must be true, but not both.\n\nAnswer: no",
