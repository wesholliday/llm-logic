This means that the two events are related, but it does not imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship. The statement only tells us that when Joe goes to the park, Lucy goes to the zoo. It does not tell us that when Lucy goes to the zoo, Joe goes to the park.\n\nThe original statement is a specific instance of a more general relationship, but it does not establish a reciprocal relationship between the two events. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park\" based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
