This statement is saying that if the shirt is made of cotton, then the pants are made of denim. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the pants are made of denim, then the shirt is made of cotton. The original statement is only making a claim about the relationship between the shirt and pants when the shirt is cotton, not the other way around.\n\nAnswer: no",
