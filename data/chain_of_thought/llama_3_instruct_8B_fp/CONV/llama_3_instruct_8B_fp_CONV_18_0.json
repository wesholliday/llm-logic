This statement is saying that if the condition \"the doll was plastic\" is true, then the consequence \"the truck was metal\" must also be true. However, this does not mean that the converse is true, i.e., if the condition \"the truck was metal\" is true, then the consequence \"the doll was plastic\" must also be true.\n\nIn other words, the original statement is not saying that the doll's material determines the truck's material, but rather that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. This does not imply that if the truck is metal, then the doll is plastic.\n\nAnswer: no",
