            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is an if-then statement, which means it's a conditional statement. The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" implies that Mary's presence at the wedding is a necessary condition for Sue's presence at the wedding. This means that if Mary was at the wedding, it's guaranteed that Sue was also at the wedding.\n\nHowever, the converse is not necessarily true. Just because Sue was at the wedding, it doesn't mean Mary was also at the wedding. There could be other conditions that led to Sue's presence at the wedding, unrelated to Mary's presence.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
