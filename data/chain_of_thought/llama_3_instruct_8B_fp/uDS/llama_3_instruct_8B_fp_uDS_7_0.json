From the second statement, we know that the umbrella is not in the closet. This means that the only remaining possibility is that the umbrella is in the car. The first statement is a disjunction, which means that one of the two options must be true. Since the umbrella is not in the closet, it must be in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
