This is known as a disjunction. The second statement \"the missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor\" provides additional information, which can help us narrow down the possibilities. Since the puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, we can eliminate that option. This leaves us with only one possibility, which is that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
