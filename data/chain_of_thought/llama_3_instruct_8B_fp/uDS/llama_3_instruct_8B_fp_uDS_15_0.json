From the second statement, we know that the shoes are not in the position described by the first statement. Since the first statement is a disjunction (either/or), we can conclude that the shoes must be in the closet. The second statement is a negation of one of the options in the first statement, which means that the other option (the shoes being in the closet) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
