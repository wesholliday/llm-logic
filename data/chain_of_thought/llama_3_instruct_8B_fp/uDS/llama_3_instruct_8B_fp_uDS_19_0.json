Since we know that the watch is not on his wrist, we can eliminate that option. This leaves us with only one possibility, which is that the watch is charging on the dresser. The absence of evidence supporting the watch being on his wrist implies that it must be in the other state, which is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
