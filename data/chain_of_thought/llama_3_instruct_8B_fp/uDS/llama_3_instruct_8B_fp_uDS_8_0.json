From the second statement, we can conclude that the remote control is not hiding under the couch. This doesn't necessarily mean it's on the coffee table, as there could be other possibilities. However, since we are given only two options, and one of those options has been eliminated, we can infer that the remote control must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
