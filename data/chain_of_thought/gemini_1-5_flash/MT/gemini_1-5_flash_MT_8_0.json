Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n4. **Applying Modus Tollens:**  We can apply Modus Tollens to our premises.  \n    * P: The vampire was awake.\n    * Q: The mummy was awake.\n    * We know \"Not Q\" is true (the mummy was not awake).\n5. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we can infer \"Not P\" - the vampire was not awake.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
