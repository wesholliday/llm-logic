It says that if the first part (the shirt being cotton) is true, then the second part (the pants being denim) must also be true.\n\n3. **Applying the logic:** Since we know the pants were not denim (Premise 2), we can conclude that the first part of the conditional statement (the shirt being cotton) cannot be true. This is because if the shirt were cotton, the pants would have to be denim, which contradicts our knowledge.\n\n4. **Therefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.**\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
