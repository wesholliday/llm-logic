Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n4. **Applying Modus Tollens:**  We can apply Modus Tollens to our premises.  \n    * P: The book was written by James.\n    * Q: The book is a mystery novel.\n    * Not Q: The book is not a mystery novel.\n5. **Conclusion:** Since we have \"Not Q\", we can infer \"Not P\", which means \"The book was not written by James\".\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
