It means that if Alex finished, Chris *must* have also finished.\n2. **Premise 2:** \"Chris did not finish the race.\" This directly contradicts the consequence of the conditional statement in Premise 1.\n3. **Inference:** Since Chris did not finish, and the conditional statement says Alex finishing *requires* Chris finishing, then Alex cannot have finished.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
