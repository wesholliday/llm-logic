Not Q. Therefore, not P. \n4. **Applying Modus Tollens:**  We can apply Modus Tollens to our premises.  \n    * P: The griffin was in the forest.\n    * Q: The unicorn was in the forest.\n    * Not Q: The unicorn was not in the forest.\n5. **Conclusion:** Since we have the form of Modus Tollens, we can infer \"The griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
