This is known as **Modus Tollens**.\n\n2. **Modus Tollens:** Modus Tollens is a valid argument form. It states that if the conditional statement is true and the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false.\n\n3. **Apply Modus Tollens to the argument:**\n    *  The conditional statement is \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n    *  The negation of the consequent is \"The muffins were not blueberry.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the argument follows the form of Modus Tollens, we can infer that the antecedent (\"The cake was chocolate\") is false.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
