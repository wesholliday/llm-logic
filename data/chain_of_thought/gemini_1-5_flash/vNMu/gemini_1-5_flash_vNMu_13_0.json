There could be other possibilities.\n\n2. **Understanding the conclusion:** \"The toy might not be in the toy box\" means it's possible the toy is somewhere else.\n\n3. **Logical validity:**  An argument is logically valid if the conclusion *must* be true if the premise is true. \n\n4. **Applying to the argument:** If the toy doesn't *have* to be in the toy box (premise), then it's certainly *possible* it's not in the toy box (conclusion). \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
