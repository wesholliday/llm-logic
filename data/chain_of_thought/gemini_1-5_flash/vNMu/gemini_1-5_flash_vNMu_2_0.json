It doesn't rule out the possibility of the griffin being in the forest, just that it's not a certainty.\n\n2. **Understanding the conclusion:** \"The griffin might not have been in the forest\" directly follows from the premise. If the griffin doesn't *have* to be in the forest, it's possible it wasn't there.\n\n3. **Logical validity:** A valid argument is one where the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, the conclusion is a direct consequence of the premise. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
