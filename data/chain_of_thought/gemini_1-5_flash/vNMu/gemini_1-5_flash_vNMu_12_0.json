There could be other possibilities.\n\n2. **Understanding the conclusion:** \"The jacket might not be draped over the chair\" means it's possible the jacket is somewhere else.\n\n3. **Logical validity:**  A valid argument means that if the premises are true, the conclusion *must* be true. \n\n4. **Applying to the argument:** If it's true that the jacket doesn't *have* to be draped over the chair, then it's certainly possible that it's not draped over the chair. The conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
