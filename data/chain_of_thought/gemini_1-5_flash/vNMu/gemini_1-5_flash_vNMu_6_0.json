It doesn't rule out the possibility that she did choose pizza, but it allows for other options.\n\n2. **Understanding the conclusion:** \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" directly aligns with the premise. It acknowledges the possibility that Sue chose something else.\n\n3. **Logical validity:**  A valid argument is one where the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, the conclusion is a direct consequence of the premise. If it's possible Sue didn't choose pizza, then it's also true that she might not have chosen pizza.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
