They are not necessarily in the closet.\n\n2. **Understanding the conclusion:** \"The shoes might not be in the closet\" means it's possible the shoes are not in the closet.\n\n3. **Logical validity:**  An argument is logically valid if the conclusion *must* be true if the premise is true. In this case, if the shoes could be somewhere else (premise), then it's definitely possible they are not in the closet (conclusion).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
