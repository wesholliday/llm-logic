It could be in the fridge, spilled, or somewhere else entirely.\n\n2. **Understanding the conclusion:** \"The milk might not be on the counter\" means it's possible the milk is not on the counter.\n\n3. **Logical validity:** An argument is logically valid if the conclusion *must* be true if the premise is true. In this case, if the milk doesn't *have* to be on the counter (premise), then it's certainly *possible* it's not on the counter (conclusion).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
