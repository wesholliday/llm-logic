It means that if Mary was present, Sue must also have been present.\n* **The question:** \"Can we infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding?\" This asks if the reverse of the original statement is true.\n* **Reasoning:**  The original statement doesn't guarantee that Mary was at the wedding if Sue was. It's possible for Sue to be at the wedding without Mary being there. For example, Sue could have gone to the wedding alone. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
