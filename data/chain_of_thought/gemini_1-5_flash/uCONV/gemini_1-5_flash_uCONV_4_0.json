Consider these examples:\n    * \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\" This is true. But \"If the ground is wet, then it's raining\" is not always true (it could be wet from sprinklers).\n    * \"If a person is a dog, then they have four legs.\" This is true. But \"If a person has four legs, then they are a dog\" is false.\n\n* **Conclusion:**  We cannot infer that if the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars. The original statement doesn't guarantee that the alien's visit to Mars is the *only* reason the robot visited Jupiter.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
