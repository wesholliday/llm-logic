The converse is \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest.\"\n* **Reasoning:**  The original statement doesn't guarantee that the griffin is *always* in the forest when the unicorn is. The unicorn could be in the forest for other reasons. \n* **Example:** Imagine the unicorn is in the forest, but the griffin is elsewhere. This scenario doesn't contradict the original statement.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
