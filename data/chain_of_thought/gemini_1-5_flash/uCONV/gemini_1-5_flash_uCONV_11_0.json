There could be other scenarios where blueberry muffins exist without a chocolate cake. \n5. **Example:** Imagine a scenario where the cake is vanilla, and the muffins are blueberry. This fits the original statement (the cake wasn't chocolate, so the statement is true), but it doesn't support the reversed statement.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
