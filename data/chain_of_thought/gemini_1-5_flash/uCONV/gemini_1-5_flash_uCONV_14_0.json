This is the converse of the original statement.\n* **Reasoning:**  Conditional statements and their converses are not always equivalent.  Think of it this way:\n    * The original statement implies that the wolf's presence in the den is dependent on the bear being in the cave. \n    * The converse suggests the bear's presence in the cave is dependent on the wolf being in the den. This might not be true. The wolf could be in the den for other reasons.\n* **Conclusion:** We cannot infer the converse from the original statement.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
