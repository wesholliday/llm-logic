This is the converse of the original statement.\n* **Reasoning:**  The converse of a conditional statement is not always true.  Here's why:\n    * The original statement implies that the mummy's wakefulness is dependent on the vampire's wakefulness. \n    * It doesn't necessarily mean the vampire's wakefulness depends on the mummy's. The mummy could be awake for other reasons.\n* **Example:** Imagine the vampire is always awake, and the mummy is sometimes awake for other reasons. The original statement would be true, but the converse would be false.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
