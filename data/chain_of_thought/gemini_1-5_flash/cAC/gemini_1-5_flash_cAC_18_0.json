It tells us that if the doll is plastic, then the truck *must* be metal. \n2. **Premise 2:** \"The truck was metal.\" This confirms the consequence of the conditional statement.\n3. **Question:** Can we conclude \"The doll was plastic\"?\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* The conditional statement doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the truck is metal. It only tells us what happens if the doll is plastic. \n* The fact that the truck is metal doesn't automatically mean the doll is plastic. The truck could be metal for other reasons.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
