This asks if the antecedent of the conditional statement is true.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* The conditional statement doesn't guarantee that the vampire was awake if the mummy was awake. It only states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy *must* be awake. \n* The mummy being awake could be due to other reasons, not just the vampire being awake.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
