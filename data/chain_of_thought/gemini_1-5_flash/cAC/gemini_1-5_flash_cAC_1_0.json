It tells us that Mary's presence at the wedding implies Sue's presence.\n2. **Premise 2:** \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This tells us that Sue was indeed at the wedding.\n3. **The question:** Can we conclude \"Mary was at the wedding\"? \n4. **Reasoning:**  The conditional statement in Premise 1 doesn't guarantee that Mary was at the wedding. It only states what happens *if* Mary was there. Sue could have been at the wedding for other reasons. \n5. **Conclusion:** We cannot conclude that Mary was at the wedding.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
