It says that if the first part (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the second part (Kate ate salad) must also be true.\n\n3. **Apply the logic:**\n   - We know that Kate ate salad (Statement 2). \n   - This doesn't automatically mean Ben ate pasta. It's possible Kate ate salad for other reasons. \n   - The conditional statement only tells us what happens *if* Ben ate pasta. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Kate ate salad.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
