It has the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the alien visited Mars\" and Q is \"the robot visited Jupiter\".\n\n3. **Apply the rule of Modus Ponens:**\n   - Modus Ponens is a valid argument form that states: If P, then Q. P. Therefore, Q.\n   - We have the first part of Modus Ponens (Statement 1).\n   - We also have the second part of Modus Ponens (Statement 2).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since we have both parts of Modus Ponens, we can conclude the third part: \"The alien visited Mars\".\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
