This asks if the antecedent of the conditional statement is true.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* The conditional statement doesn't guarantee that Tom watched football. It only states what happens *if* he did. \n* Jen watching basketball could be due to other reasons, not just Tom watching football. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
