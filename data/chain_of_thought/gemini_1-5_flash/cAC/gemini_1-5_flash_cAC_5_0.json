            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the premises:**\n   - Premise 1: If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n   - Premise 2: Amy played tennis.\n\n2. **Analyze the structure:**\n   - Premise 1 is a conditional statement (if-then).\n   - Premise 2 is a simple statement.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of inference:**\n   - The rule of inference that applies here is **modus ponens**. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (if p then q) and we know that p is true, then we can conclude that q is true.\n\n4. **Check if the conditions are met:**\n   - We have a conditional statement (Premise 1).\n   - We know that the consequent of the conditional statement (Amy played tennis) is true (Premise 2).\n\n5. **Apply the conclusion:**\n   - Since the conditions for modus ponens are met, we can conclude that the antecedent of the conditional statement (Jeff played basketball) is true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
