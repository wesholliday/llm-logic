However, it doesn't necessarily mean that if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe *must* have gone to the park. \n2. **We are given that \"Lucy went to the zoo\".** This confirms one part of the conditional statement.\n3. **However, the conditional statement doesn't guarantee that Joe went to the park.** Lucy could have gone to the zoo for other reasons, even if Joe didn't go to the park.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
