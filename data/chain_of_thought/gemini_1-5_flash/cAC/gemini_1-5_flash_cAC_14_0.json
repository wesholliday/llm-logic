It states: If P, then Q. P is true. Therefore, Q is true.\n   - In our case, P is \"The bear was in the cave\" and Q is \"The wolf was in the den.\"\n   - We know Q is true (from Statement 2). \n   - However, Modus Ponens only allows us to conclude Q is true if P is true. It doesn't work the other way around.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - We cannot conclude that \"The bear was in the cave\" based on the given information. The wolf being in the den doesn't necessarily mean the bear was in the cave. There could be other reasons why the wolf was in the den.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
