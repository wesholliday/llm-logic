    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it\u2019s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn\u2019t get the offer, then if Priya doesn\u2019t, Diego will. Moreover, it\u2019s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn\u2019t get the offer, Diego will?",

If Julian doesn't get the offer, Diego will. \n2. **The question:**  Is it likely that if Priya doesn't get the offer, Diego will?\n3. **Reasoning:**  We know Priya is the most likely candidate. If she doesn't get the offer, it's likely Julian will, as he's the next most likely.  This means Diego is only likely to get the offer if *both* Priya and Julian don't. \n4. **Conclusion:**  It's not necessarily likely that Diego will get the offer if Priya doesn't. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
