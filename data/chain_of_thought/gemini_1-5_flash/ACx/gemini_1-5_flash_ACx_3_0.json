It tells us that if the splat was morphed, then it definitely quanked. \n2. **Premise 2:** \"The splat quanked.\" This tells us that the splat did indeed quank.\n3. **Reasoning:**  We know the splat quanked (Premise 2).  The conditional statement (Premise 1) says that quanking is a consequence of being morphed. However, just because the splat quanked doesn't automatically mean it was morphed. There could be other reasons why the splat quanked. \n4. **Example:** Imagine a scenario where a splat can quank for reasons other than being morphed.  The conditional statement would still be true, but we wouldn't be able to infer that the splat was morphed.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
