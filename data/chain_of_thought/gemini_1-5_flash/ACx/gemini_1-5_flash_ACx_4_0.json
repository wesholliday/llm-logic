In this case, P is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and Q is \"the fribble crinked\".\n2. **Apply the rule of Modus Ponens:** Modus Ponens is a valid argument form that states: If P, then Q. P is true. Therefore, Q is true.\n3. **Check if Modus Ponens applies:** We are given that \"The fribble crinked\" (Q is true). However, we are not given that \"The fribble was snurgled\" (P is true). \n4. **Conclusion:** Since we don't know if P is true, we cannot apply Modus Ponens to infer that \"The fribble was snurgled\".\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
