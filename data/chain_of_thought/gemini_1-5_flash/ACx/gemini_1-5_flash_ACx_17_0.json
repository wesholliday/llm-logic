It means that if the flob was skizzled, then it definitely movated. However, it doesn't say anything about what happens if the flob wasn't skizzled. \n\n2. **The additional information:** \"The flob movated.\" This tells us that the flob did indeed movate.\n\n3. **The question:** Can we infer \"The flob was skizzled\"?  \n\n4. **Reasoning:**  The conditional statement doesn't guarantee that the flob was skizzled just because it movated. There could be other reasons why the flob movated. The statement only tells us that skizzled flobs *must* movate. It doesn't say that movating flobs *must* be skizzled.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
