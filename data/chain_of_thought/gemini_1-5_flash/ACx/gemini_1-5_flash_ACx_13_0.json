Premise 2 states the consequent of the conditional statement.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of inference:** The rule of inference that applies here is **affirming the consequent**. This rule states that if we know the consequent of a conditional statement is true, we cannot infer that the antecedent is also true.\n\n4. **Reasoning:**  Just because the glip was tragged doesn't necessarily mean it was slogged. There could be other reasons why the glip was tragged.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
