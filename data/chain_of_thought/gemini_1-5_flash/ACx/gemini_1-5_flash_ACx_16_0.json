In this case, P is \"The sneg was crampled\" and Q is \"The sneg sproted the frink\". \n2. **Understand the relationship:**  A conditional statement doesn't guarantee that P is true if Q is true. It only states that if P is true, then Q must also be true. \n3. **Consider the second statement:** The second statement tells us that Q is true (\"The sneg sproted the frink\").\n4. **Apply the logic:**  Knowing that Q is true doesn't automatically mean that P is true. There could be other reasons why the sneg sproted the frink. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
