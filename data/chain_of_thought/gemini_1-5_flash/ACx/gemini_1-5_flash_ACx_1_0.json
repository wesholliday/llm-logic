It tells us that if the flugel was blimmed, then it must also be zargled. \n2. **Premise 2:** \"The flugel was zargled.\" This tells us that the flugel was indeed zargled.\n3. **Reasoning:**  We know that the flugel being zargled is a consequence of it being blimmed (from Premise 1). However, we don't know if there are other ways the flugel could be zargled. It's possible the flugel was zargled for a reason other than being blimmed.\n4. **Conclusion:** We cannot infer that the flugel was blimmed. Just because the flugel was zargled doesn't automatically mean it was blimmed.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
