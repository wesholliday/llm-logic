It means that if the first part (\"the clug was fleeked\") is true, then the second part (\"the clug snugged\") must also be true.\n\n2. **We know:** \"The clug snugged\" is true.\n\n3. **The question:** Can we infer \"The clug was fleeked\"?\n\n4. **Reasoning:**  The conditional statement doesn't guarantee that the first part is true just because the second part is true. There could be other reasons why the clug snugged.  For example, maybe the clug snugged because it was fluffed, not because it was fleeked.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
