It tells us that cranking the sprocket implies daggling it.\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The sprocket was daggled.\" This tells us that the sprocket was indeed daggled.\n3. **Inference:** We want to know if we can infer \"The sprocket was cranked\" from these premises.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* The conditional statement in Premise 1 doesn't guarantee that cranking is the *only* way to daggle the sprocket. There could be other ways to daggle it. \n* Since we only know the sprocket was daggled, we can't be certain it was cranked. It could have been daggled by some other means.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
