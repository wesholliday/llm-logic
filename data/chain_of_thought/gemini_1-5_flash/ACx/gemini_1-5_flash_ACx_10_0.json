It states that if the wug was sproinged, then a certain consequence (being garpled) follows.\n   - Premise 2 tells us that the consequence (being garpled) is true.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of inference:**\n   - The rule of inference that applies here is **modus ponens**. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (if p then q) and we know that p is true, then we can infer that q is also true.\n\n4. **Apply modus ponens to our premises:**\n   - In our case, p is \"the wug was sproinged\" and q is \"the wug was garpled.\"\n   - We know that q is true (Premise 2).\n   - Therefore, we cannot infer that p is true (the wug was sproinged).\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
