It means that if the first part (the smip was shripped) is true, then the second part (the smip lupped the zoint) must also be true.\n\n2. **The additional information:** \"The smip lupped the zoint.\" This tells us the second part of the conditional statement is true.\n\n3. **The question:** Can we infer \"The smip was shripped\"?  \n\n4. **Reasoning:**  The conditional statement doesn't work in reverse. Just because the smip lupped the zoint doesn't automatically mean it was shripped. There could be other reasons why the smip lupped the zoint. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
