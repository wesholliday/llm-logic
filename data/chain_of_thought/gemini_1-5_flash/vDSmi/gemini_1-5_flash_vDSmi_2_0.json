It only says it *might* not be.\n* Since Premise 1 is an exclusive disjunction, if the book isn't on the table, it *must* be on the shelf. However, Premise 2 doesn't definitively say the book isn't on the table.\n* Therefore, the conclusion doesn't logically follow from the premises.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
