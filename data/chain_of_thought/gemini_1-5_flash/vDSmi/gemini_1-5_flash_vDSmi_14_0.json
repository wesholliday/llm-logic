It means the milk can be in one place or the other, but not both.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\" This premise introduces uncertainty. It doesn't definitively say the milk *isn't* in the fridge, just that it *might* not be.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"The milk is on the counter.\" This conclusion jumps to a definitive statement based on the uncertainty of the second premise.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe argument is not logically valid because the second premise doesn't definitively rule out the milk being in the fridge.  The \"might not\" leaves open the possibility that the milk is still in the fridge.  Therefore, the conclusion cannot be logically derived from the premises.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
