It only says it *might* not be there.\n* Since Premise 1 is an exclusive disjunction, if the jacket isn't in the closet, it *must* be draped over the chair. \n* However, Premise 2 doesn't definitively say the jacket *isn't* in the closet.\n\n**Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
