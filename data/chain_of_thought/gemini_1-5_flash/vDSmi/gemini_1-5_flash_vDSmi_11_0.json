It only says it *might* not be there.\n* Since Premise 1 is an exclusive disjunction, if the newspaper isn't on the porch, it *must* be in the driveway. \n* However, Premise 2 doesn't definitively say the newspaper *isn't* on the porch.\n\n**Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
