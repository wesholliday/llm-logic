This means if one possibility is false, the other must be true.\n* Premise 2 only weakens the possibility of the sunglasses being on her head. It doesn't definitively rule it out.\n* Therefore, it's possible that the sunglasses are *not* on her head, but they could still be in her bag. The argument doesn't provide enough information to definitively conclude that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
