It only says it's possible the cat isn't playing there. \n* Since Premise 1 is an exclusive disjunction, if the cat isn't playing in the bedroom, it *must* be napping on the couch. \n* However, the argument doesn't definitively prove the cat isn't playing in the bedroom.\n\n**Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
