It only says they *might not* be there. \n* Therefore, even if the cookies aren't in the pantry, they could still be in the jar, as stated in Premise 1.\n* However, the argument doesn't definitively prove that the cookies *are* in the jar. It only eliminates the pantry as a *definite* location.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
