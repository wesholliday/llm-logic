This means if it's not under the bed, it *must* be in the laundry basket.\n* Premise 2 doesn't contradict this. It simply says the sock *might* not be under the bed, leaving open the possibility that it *could* be there. \n* Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
