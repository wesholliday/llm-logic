It only states that studying hard guarantees passing. The new statement introduces a new factor (the language) that could potentially affect the outcome. \n4. **Conclusion:** We cannot infer the new statement from the original statement because the original statement doesn't provide any information about the language of the test. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
