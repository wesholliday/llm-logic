The computer catching fire is a completely unrelated event.  It doesn't change the original condition.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**  We cannot infer that playing video games is possible if the computer catches fire, even if homework is finished. The computer catching fire would likely prevent playing video games.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
