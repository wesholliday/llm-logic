It means that going to the concert is a sufficient condition for having a good time. \n\n2. **The new statement:** \"If we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time.\" This statement adds an additional condition (a bomb going off) to the original statement.\n\n3. **Reasoning:** The original statement doesn't say anything about what happens if a bomb goes off. It only states that going to the concert guarantees a good time.  The new statement introduces a completely different scenario that wasn't considered in the original statement.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** We cannot infer the new statement from the original statement. The original statement doesn't provide any information about what happens in the case of a bomb going off.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
