It doesn't say anything about what happens if the garage is flooding.\n\n2. **New statement:** \"If the car is in the garage and the garage is flooding, then it is safe.\" This statement adds a new condition (the garage flooding).\n\n3. **Reasoning:** The original statement only guarantees safety if the car is in the garage. It doesn't address the situation where the garage is flooding. A flooding garage would likely make the car unsafe.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
