It means that if the package has shipped, then the arrival today is guaranteed. \n2. **New statement:** \"If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today.\" This statement adds a new condition: the package being misrouted.\n3. **Reasoning:** The original statement only guarantees arrival if the package shipped. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the package is misrouted.  Therefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original statement.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
