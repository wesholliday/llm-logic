It means that if the bill is paid, the services will definitely continue. However, it doesn't say anything about what happens if the bill isn't paid, or if the payment method fails.\n\n2. **New statement:** \"If the bill is paid and the check bounces, then the services will continue.\" This statement adds a new condition: the check bouncing. \n\n3. **Reasoning:** The original statement only guarantees continued services if the bill is paid successfully. A bounced check means the bill wasn't paid successfully. Therefore, the new statement contradicts the original statement.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
