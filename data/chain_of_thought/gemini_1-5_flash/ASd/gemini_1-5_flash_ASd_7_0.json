It doesn't say anything about the pilot light.\n\n2. **New statement:** \"If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm.\" This statement adds a new condition (pilot light being out) to the original statement.\n\n3. **Reasoning:** The original statement only guarantees a warm kitchen if the oven is on. It doesn't say anything about the pilot light's status.  The pilot light being out could potentially affect the oven's ability to heat the kitchen.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** We cannot infer the new statement from the original statement. The new statement introduces a new condition that wasn't part of the original statement.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
