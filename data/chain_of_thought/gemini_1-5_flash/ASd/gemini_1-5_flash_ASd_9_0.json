It means that if the first part (the essay is well-written) is true, then the second part (the student will get an A) must also be true.\n\n2. **New statement:** \"If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A.\" This statement adds a new condition (turned in late) to the original statement.\n\n3. **Reasoning:** The original statement only guarantees an A if the essay is well-written. It doesn't say anything about the essay being turned in on time.  Therefore, the new statement is not necessarily true.  The student might get a lower grade for turning in the essay late, even if it's well-written.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
