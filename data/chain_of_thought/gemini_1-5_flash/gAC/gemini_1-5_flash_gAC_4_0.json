This is a conditional statement.\n2. **We also know:** \"The robot visited Jupiter\" is true.\n3. **The question:** Does it follow that \"The alien visited Mars\" is true?\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* The conditional statement tells us that if the alien visited Mars, then a consequence must follow: the robot visiting Jupiter.\n* We know the consequence (the robot visiting Jupiter) is true.\n* However, this doesn't automatically mean the alien visited Mars. The robot could have visited Jupiter for other reasons. \n\n**Example:** Imagine the robot was programmed to visit Jupiter regardless of whether the alien visited Mars.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
