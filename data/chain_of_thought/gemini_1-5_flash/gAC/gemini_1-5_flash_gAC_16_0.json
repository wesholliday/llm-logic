It means that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants *must* be denim. \n2. **The second given statement:** \"The pants were denim\" is true. This tells us that the consequence of the conditional statement is true.\n3. **The question:** Does it follow that \"The shirt was cotton\" is true?  \n4. **Reasoning:**  The conditional statement doesn't guarantee that the shirt *must* be cotton if the pants are denim. It only states what happens *if* the shirt is cotton. The pants being denim could be due to other reasons, not just the shirt being cotton. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
