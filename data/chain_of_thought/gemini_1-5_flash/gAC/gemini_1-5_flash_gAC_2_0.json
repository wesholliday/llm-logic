This is a conditional statement.\n2. **The second given statement:** \"The unicorn was in the forest\" is true. This is the consequent of the conditional statement.\n3. **The question:** Does it follow that \"The griffin was in the forest\" is true? This is asking if the antecedent of the conditional statement is also true.\n4. **Reasoning:**  A conditional statement is only false if the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. Since we know the consequent is true, the conditional statement could be true even if the antecedent is false. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
