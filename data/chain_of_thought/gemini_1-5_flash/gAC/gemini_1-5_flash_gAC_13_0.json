This is a conditional statement.\n2. **The second given statement:** \"The truck was blue\" is true. This confirms the consequent of the conditional statement.\n3. **The question:** Does it follow that \"The car was red\" is true? This asks if we can infer the antecedent of the conditional statement.\n4. **Reasoning:**  While the truck being blue satisfies the condition set by the conditional statement, it doesn't necessarily mean the car was red. The truck could be blue for other reasons. \n5. **Example:** Imagine a scenario where there are multiple red cars and multiple blue trucks. The truck being blue doesn't tell us which car it was associated with.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
