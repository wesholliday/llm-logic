It doesn't say the dog *was* inside, only that *if* it was, then the cat was outside.\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The cat was outside.\" This confirms the consequence of the conditional statement in Premise 1.\n3. **Question:** Does it follow that \"The dog was inside\" is true? \n4. **Reasoning:**  The conditional statement in Premise 1 only tells us what happens *if* the dog is inside. It doesn't tell us whether the dog *actually* was inside. The cat being outside could be due to other reasons, not just the dog being inside. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
