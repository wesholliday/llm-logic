It means that if the first part (the cake being chocolate) is true, then the second part (the muffins being blueberry) must also be true.\n\n2. **Analyzing the given information:** We know that the statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is true. We also know that \"The muffins were blueberry\" is true.\n\n3. **Applying the logic:**  The fact that the muffins were blueberry doesn't automatically mean the cake was chocolate. The conditional statement only guarantees that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would be blueberry. It doesn't work the other way around. There could be other reasons why the muffins were blueberry.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**  We cannot conclude that the cake was chocolate based on the given information.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
