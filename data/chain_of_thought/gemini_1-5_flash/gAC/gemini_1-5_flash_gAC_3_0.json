It means that if the first part is true (the book was written by James), then the second part must also be true (the book is a mystery novel).\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The book is a mystery novel.\" This confirms the second part of the conditional statement is true.\n\n3. **The Question:** Does it follow that \"The book was written by James\" is true?\n\n4. **Reasoning:**  The conditional statement doesn't guarantee that the book *must* have been written by James. It only states what happens *if* it was written by James.  There could be other authors who write mystery novels.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
