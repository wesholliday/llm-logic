It means that if the doll is plastic, the truck *must* be metal. \n\n2. **The second given statement:** \"The truck was metal\" is true. This tells us that the consequence of the conditional statement is true.\n\n3. **The question:** Does it follow that \"The doll was plastic\" is true?  \n\n4. **Reasoning:**  We know the truck was metal. However, the conditional statement doesn't guarantee that the doll *must* be plastic if the truck is metal. It only states what happens *if* the doll is plastic. There could be other reasons why the truck is metal.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
