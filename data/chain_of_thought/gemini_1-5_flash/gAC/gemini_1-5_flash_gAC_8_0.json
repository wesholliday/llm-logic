This asks if the antecedent of the conditional statement is also true.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* A conditional statement is only false if the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. \n* We know the consequent (the mummy being awake) is true.\n* Therefore, the antecedent (the vampire being awake) could be either true or false without making the conditional statement false.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
