It tells us that if Alex finished, then Chris must have also finished. \n2. **Premise 2:** \"Chris finished the race.\" This tells us that Chris did indeed finish the race.\n3. **Inference:** We want to know if we can infer that Alex finished the race. \n4. **Reasoning:**  The conditional statement in Premise 1 doesn't guarantee that Alex finished. It only states what happens *if* Alex finishes.  The fact that Chris finished doesn't automatically mean Alex did. It's possible Chris finished for another reason.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
