It tells us that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest. \n\n2. **The second statement:** \"The unicorn was in the forest.\" This tells us that the unicorn was indeed in the forest.\n\n3. **The question:** Can we infer \"The griffin was in the forest\"?  \n\n4. **Reasoning:**  The conditional statement doesn't guarantee that the griffin was in the forest. It only states what happens *if* the griffin is in the forest. The unicorn being in the forest doesn't automatically mean the griffin was there. There could be other reasons why the unicorn was in the forest.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
