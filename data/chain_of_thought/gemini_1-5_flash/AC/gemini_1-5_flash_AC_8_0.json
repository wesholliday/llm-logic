This asks if the antecedent of the conditional statement is also true.\n4. **Reasoning:**  A conditional statement being true doesn't automatically mean the antecedent is true. For example, \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet\" is true. But if the ground is wet, it doesn't necessarily mean it's raining (it could be wet from something else).\n5. **Conclusion:** We cannot infer that the vampire was awake.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
