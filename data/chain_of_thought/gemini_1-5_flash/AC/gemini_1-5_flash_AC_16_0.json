It doesn't say anything about what happens if the shirt *wasn't* cotton.\n\n3. **Consider the possibilities:**\n   - **Possibility 1:** The shirt *was* cotton. This fits both premises.\n   - **Possibility 2:** The shirt *wasn't* cotton. This doesn't contradict either premise. The pants could be denim for other reasons.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** We can't definitively conclude that the shirt was cotton.  The pants being denim doesn't guarantee the shirt was cotton.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
