Premise 2 is a simple statement.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of Modus Ponens:** Modus Ponens is a valid argument form that states:\n   - If P, then Q.\n   - P.\n   - Therefore, Q.\n\n4. **Match the premises to the form:**\n   - P: The alien visited Mars.\n   - Q: The robot visited Jupiter.\n\n5. **Determine if the argument is valid:**  We have both the conditional statement (Premise 1) and the antecedent (Premise 2) of the conditional. Therefore, we can infer the consequent (The alien visited Mars).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
