It tells us that if the doll is plastic, then the truck *must* be metal. \n2. **Premise 2:** \"The truck was metal.\" This confirms the consequence of the conditional statement.\n3. **Inference:** We want to know if we can infer \"The doll was plastic.\"  \n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* The conditional statement doesn't guarantee that the doll *must* be plastic if the truck is metal. It only states what happens *if* the doll is plastic. \n* The truck being metal could be due to other reasons, not necessarily because the doll is plastic.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
