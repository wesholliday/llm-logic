It doesn't tell us whether Ben actually ate pasta, only what would happen if he did.\n\n3. **Apply the concept of Modus Ponens:** Modus Ponens is a valid argument form that says:\n   - If P, then Q.\n   - P.\n   - Therefore, Q.\n\n4. **Check if Modus Ponens applies:**\n   - In our case, P is \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q is \"Kate ate the salad.\"\n   - We have both \"If P, then Q\" and \"Q.\"\n   - However, we don't have \"P\" (Ben ate pasta).\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since we don't have the statement \"Ben ate pasta,\" we cannot infer it using Modus Ponens or any other valid argument form.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
