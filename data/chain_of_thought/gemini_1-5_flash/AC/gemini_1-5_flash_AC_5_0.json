It doesn't guarantee that Jeff played basketball, only that if he did, then Amy played tennis.\n   - Premise 2 tells us that the consequence of the conditional statement (Amy playing tennis) is true.\n\n3. **Apply the concept of affirming the consequent:**\n   - The fallacy of affirming the consequent occurs when we assume the antecedent (Jeff playing basketball) is true just because the consequent (Amy playing tennis) is true. \n\n4. **Consider alternative scenarios:**\n   - Amy could have played tennis for reasons other than Jeff playing basketball. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
