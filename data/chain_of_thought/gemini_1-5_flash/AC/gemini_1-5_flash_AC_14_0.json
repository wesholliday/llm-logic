Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement and we know the hypothesis is true, then we can infer the conclusion is also true.\n\n4. **Check if the conditions for modus ponens are met:**\n   - We know the conclusion of the conditional statement (Statement 1) is true (Statement 2).\n   - However, we don't know if the hypothesis of the conditional statement (Statement 1) is true.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since we don't know if the hypothesis of the conditional statement is true, we cannot infer that the bear was in the cave.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
