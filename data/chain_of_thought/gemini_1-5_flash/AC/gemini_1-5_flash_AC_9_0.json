            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the premises:**\n   - Premise 1: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n   - Premise 2: \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the structure:** Premise 1 is a conditional statement (if-then).  The statement \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is the antecedent, and \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is the consequent.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of Modus Ponens:** Modus Ponens is a valid argument form that states: If we know \"If P, then Q\" is true, and we know \"P\" is true, then we can infer \"Q\" is true.\n\n4. **Check if Modus Ponens applies:** In our case, we know \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" (the consequent) is true. However, we don't know if \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" (the antecedent) is true.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since we don't know if the antecedent is true, we cannot apply Modus Ponens to infer that \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\"\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
