The statement \"Tom watched football\" is the antecedent, and \"Jen watched basketball\" is the consequent.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of inference:** We can't directly infer that Tom watched football.  The fact that Jen watched basketball doesn't automatically mean Tom watched football.  The conditional statement only tells us what happens *if* Tom watched football. It doesn't tell us what happened if Jen watched basketball.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
