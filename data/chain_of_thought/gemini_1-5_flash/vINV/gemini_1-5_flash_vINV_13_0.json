If the premise is true, the truck must be blue. This scenario supports the conclusion.\n    * **Scenario 2:** The car was not red. The premise doesn't tell us anything about the truck's color in this case. The conclusion could be true or false.\n\n**Since the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premise in all cases, the argument is not logically valid.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
