            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the argument:** The argument claims that if the griffin being in the forest implies the unicorn being in the forest, then the griffin not being in the forest implies the unicorn not being in the forest.\n\n2. **Analyzing the structure:** This argument uses the concept of contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n3. **Logical validity:** The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\n4. **Applying to the argument:** In this case, the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, the argument is valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
