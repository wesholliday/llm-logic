            "content": "Here's how we can break down the argument:\n\n1. **Understanding the premise:** \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This is a conditional statement. It means that if the cake is chocolate, we can be certain the muffins are blueberry. However, it doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the cake is *not* chocolate.\n\n2. **Understanding the conclusion:** \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\" This is also a conditional statement. It claims that if the cake is not chocolate, then the muffins must also not be blueberry.\n\n3. **Analyzing the relationship:** The conclusion is the *contrapositive* of the premise. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then switching their order.  \n\n4. **Logical validity:**  A contrapositive is logically equivalent to its original statement. This means that if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
