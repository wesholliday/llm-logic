The contrapositive of the premise is \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\" \n* **Relationship to the conclusion:** Notice that the conclusion is the converse of the contrapositive.  The converse of a statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n**Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
