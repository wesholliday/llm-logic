            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the argument:** The argument states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also there. It then concludes that if Mary wasn't at the wedding, then Sue wasn't there either.\n\n2. **Identifying the logical form:** This argument uses the concept of the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n3. **Evaluating validity:** The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\n4. **Applying to the argument:** In this case, the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, the argument is valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
