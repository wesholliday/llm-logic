It doesn't say anything about what happens if Jeff *didn't* play basketball. \n* **Consider the conclusion:** The conclusion claims that Jeff *not* playing basketball *implies* Amy *not* playing tennis. This is a different scenario than the premise.\n\n**Reasoning:** The premise only tells us about a specific scenario (Jeff playing basketball). It doesn't tell us anything about what happens in other scenarios, like Jeff not playing basketball. Therefore, the conclusion doesn't logically follow from the premise.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
