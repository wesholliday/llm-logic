            "content": "Here's how we can break down the argument:\n\n1. **Premise:** \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This is a conditional statement. \n2. **Conclusion:** \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.\" This is also a conditional statement.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion follows logically from the premise.  We can use a technique called the **contrapositive**.\n\n**The Contrapositive**\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then switching their positions.  \n\n* **Original statement:** If P, then Q.\n* **Contrapositive:** If not Q, then not P.\n\n**Applying the Contrapositive**\n\n* **Premise:** If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n* **Contrapositive of the premise:** If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside.\n\nNotice that the contrapositive of the premise is logically equivalent to the original premise. They always have the same truth value.\n\n**Comparing to the Conclusion**\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is: \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.\" This is the same as the contrapositive of the premise.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSince the conclusion is logically equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is **logically valid**.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
