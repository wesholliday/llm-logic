            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the argument:** The argument states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. It then concludes that if Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, then Mark didn't buy the blue shirt.\n\n2. **Identifying the logical form:** This argument is a classic example of the **contrapositive**. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and switching their order.\n\n3. **Evaluating validity:** The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the argument's conclusion is the contrapositive of its premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
