            "content": "Here's how we can break down the argument:\n\n1. **Understanding the premise:** \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This is a conditional statement. It means that if the shirt is cotton, we can be certain the pants are denim. However, it doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the shirt is *not* cotton.\n\n2. **Understanding the conclusion:** \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\" This is also a conditional statement. It claims that if the shirt is not cotton, then the pants must also not be denim.\n\n3. **Analyzing the relationship:** The conclusion is the *contrapositive* of the premise. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then switching their order.  \n\n4. **Logical validity:**  A contrapositive is logically equivalent to its original statement. This means that if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
