            "content": "Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Understanding the Argument:** The argument claims that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true. \n\n2. **Analyzing the Premise:** The premise states \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement. It doesn't say that Jen *only* watches basketball if Tom watches football, just that if Tom watches football, Jen *must* also watch basketball.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Conclusion:** The conclusion states \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\" This is also a conditional statement. It's the contrapositive of the premise.\n\n4. **Logical Equivalence:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means they have the same truth value. If the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\n5. **Validity:** Since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and contrapositives are logically equivalent, the argument is valid. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
