            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the argument:** The argument claims that if the vampire being awake implies the mummy being awake, then the vampire not being awake implies the mummy not being awake.\n\n2. **Analyzing the structure:** This argument uses the concept of the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and switching their positions.\n\n3. **Applying the contrapositive:** The original statement is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" Its contrapositive is \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\"\n\n4. **Logical equivalence:** The original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they have the same truth value. If one is true, the other must also be true.\n\n5. **Validity:** Since the conclusion of the argument is the contrapositive of the premise, and contrapositives are logically equivalent, the argument is logically valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
