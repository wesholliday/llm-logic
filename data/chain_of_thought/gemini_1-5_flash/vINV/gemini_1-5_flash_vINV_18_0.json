            "content": "Here's how we can break down the argument:\n\n1. **Understanding the Form:** The argument uses a conditional statement (\"If...then...\") in the premise and its contrapositive in the conclusion. \n\n2. **Contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a statement flips the order and negates both parts.  So, the contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n3. **Logical Equivalence:** A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they have the same truth value. If one is true, the other must also be true.\n\n4. **Validity:** An argument is logically valid if the conclusion *must* be true whenever the premises are true. Since the premise and conclusion are logically equivalent, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
