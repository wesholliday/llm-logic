            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the form of the argument:** The argument is a conditional statement (if p then q) and its contrapositive (if not q then not p).\n2. **Understand the relationship between a conditional statement and its contrapositive:** A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they have the same truth value. If one is true, the other is also true. If one is false, the other is also false.\n3. **Apply the equivalence to the argument:** Since the premise is a conditional statement and the conclusion is its contrapositive, they are logically equivalent.\n4. **Determine validity:**  A valid argument is one where the conclusion logically follows from the premise. Since the premise and conclusion are logically equivalent, the conclusion does follow from the premise.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
