    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a vringlet, a crappen, and a strorvil are shortlisted for the Liggerton Award in bloffu this year. Bloffu critics regard the vringlet as the front runner, followed by the crappen, while the strorvil is a heavy underdog. Since these are the only finalists under consideration, if the crappen doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the vringlet doesn\u2019t win, the strorvil will win. Moreover, the vringlet likely will win the award and hence the crappen likely won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the vringlet doesn\u2019t win the Liggerton Award, the strorvil will?",

This is because they are the only finalists.\n2. **Premise 2:** The vringlet is likely to win, and therefore the crappen is likely not to win.\n3. **Question:** Does it follow that if the vringlet doesn't win, the strorvil is likely to win?\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* Premise 2 tells us the crappen is unlikely to win. \n* If the vringlet doesn't win, and the crappen is unlikely to win, then the strorvil is the only remaining finalist. \n* Therefore, it is likely that the strorvil would win if the vringlet doesn't win.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
