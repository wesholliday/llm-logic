    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantug, a loperit, and a frallon are shortlisted for Blither of the Year. Industry watchers consider the fantug the front runner, followed by the loperit, while the frallon is a heavy underdog. Since these are the only products in contention, if the loperit doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the fantug doesn\u2019t win, the frallon will win. Moreover, the fantug likely will win the award and hence the loperit likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantug doesn't win Blither of the Year, the frallon will?",

This is a direct consequence of the fact that these are the only three contenders.\n2. **The additional information:** We are also told that the fantug is likely to win, and therefore the loperit is likely not to win.\n3. **Combining the information:** If the fantug doesn't win, then the loperit is definitely not going to win (since it's less likely to win than the fantug). \n4. **Conclusion:** Since the loperit won't win if the fantug doesn't, and the frallon is the only other contender, it follows that the frallon will win if the fantug doesn't.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
