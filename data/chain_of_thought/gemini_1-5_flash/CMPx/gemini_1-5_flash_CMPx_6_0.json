    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jentil, a lomfry, and a darsal are the leading gardam suppliers this quarter. Industry analysts expect the jentil likely will sell the most gardam, followed by the lomfry, with the darsal significantly lower. These dominate gardam sales, so if the lomfry doesn\u2019t sell the most gardam, then if the jentil doesn\u2019t, the darsal will. Moreover, the jentil likely will lead gardam sales and hence the lomfry likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the jentil doesn\u2019t lead gardam sales, the darsal will?",

            "content": "Here's the breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** The jentil is likely to sell the most gardam, followed by the lomfry, with the darsal significantly lower.\n2. **Premise 2:** If the lomfry doesn't sell the most gardam, then if the jentil doesn't, the darsal will.\n3. **Premise 3:** The jentil is likely to lead gardam sales, and hence the lomfry likely won't.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* Premise 3 tells us the jentil is likely to lead, making the lomfry unlikely to lead. \n* This aligns with Premise 1, where the jentil is expected to sell the most.\n* If the jentil *doesn't* lead, it means the lomfry also didn't lead (due to Premise 3).\n* This scenario directly triggers the condition in Premise 2, where if the lomfry doesn't lead, and the jentil doesn't lead, then the darsal will.\n\n**Therefore, it logically follows that if the jentil doesn't lead gardam sales, the darsal will.**\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
