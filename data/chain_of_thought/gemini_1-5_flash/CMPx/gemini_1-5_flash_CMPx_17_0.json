    "user_prompt": "Suppose a flinker, a dringen, and a n\u00fcffen have the best projections to have a breakout season next year. Talent scouts believe it's highly probable the flinker will have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen, while the n\u00fcffen is an outside shot. Since these are the only top prospects, if the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. Moreover, scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season and hence the dringen likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will?",

The n\u00fcffen is an outside shot.\n2. **Premise 2:** If the dringen doesn't have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season.\n3. **Premise 3:** Scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season and hence the dringen likely won't.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* Premise 3 suggests the dringen is unlikely to have a breakout season.\n* If the dringen doesn't have a breakout season, and the flinker also doesn't, then Premise 2 tells us the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season.\n* Since the flinker is likely to have a breakout season, the scenario where both the flinker and dringen don't have breakout seasons is less likely. However, it's still possible.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile it's not guaranteed, it's *likely* that if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
