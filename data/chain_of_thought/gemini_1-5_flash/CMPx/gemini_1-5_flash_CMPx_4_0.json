    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crinel, a nafiz, and a tomul are competing to be snarggle of next year's laggle team. The crinel is considered the frontrunner for snarggle, followed by the nafiz, while the tomul is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates, if the nafiz isn\u2019t named snarggle, then if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle. Moreover, the crinel likely will be named snarggle and hence the nafiz likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be?",

            "content": "Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **The premise:** We know the crinel is the frontrunner, the nafiz is second, and the tomul is a long shot. This suggests the crinel is most likely to be named snarggle, followed by the nafiz, and the tomul is least likely.\n\n2. **The conditional statement:**  \"If the nafiz isn\u2019t named snarggle, then if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle.\" This is a complex conditional statement. It essentially means that if both the crinel and nafiz are not chosen, the tomul will be.\n\n3. **The additional information:** \"The crinel likely will be named snarggle and hence the nafiz likely won\u2019t be.\" This reinforces the initial premise about the likelihood of each candidate being chosen.\n\n4. **The question:** \"Does it follow that it is likely that, if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be?\"  We need to determine if the given information supports the conclusion that the tomul is likely to be chosen if the crinel isn't.\n\n5. **Reasoning:**  While the conditional statement is true, it doesn't necessarily mean the tomul is likely to be chosen if the crinel isn't. The premise states the crinel is the frontrunner, making it more likely to be chosen than the tomul.  The fact that the nafiz is also unlikely to be chosen doesn't automatically make the tomul the most likely candidate.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
