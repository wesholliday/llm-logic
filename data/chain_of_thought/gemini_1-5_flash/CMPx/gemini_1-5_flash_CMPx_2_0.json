    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **The premise:** The jantiz is the most qualified, followed by the cramen, and the sulect is the least qualified. \n2. **The scenario:** If the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, the cramen will be the next most qualified applicant.\n3. **The implication:** Since the sulect is the only other applicant, if the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, the sulect will. \n4. **The additional information:** The jantiz is likely to get the zulision, meaning the cramen is unlikely to get it. \n5. **The question:** Does it follow that it's likely that, if the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, the sulect will?\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe additional information about the jantiz's likelihood of getting the zulision doesn't change the fact that if the jantiz doesn't get it, the sulect will. The sulect's chances are dependent on the jantiz's outcome, not the cramen's.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
