    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a dribbet, a vrendel, and a toffen lead this quarter\u2019s gadston sales. Market analysts expect the dribbet likely will retain the top sales spot, followed by the vrendel, with gadston sales for the toffen significantly lower. These dominate the gadston market currently, so if the vrendel isn\u2019t #1 in sales, then if the dribbet isn\u2019t #1, the toffen will be #1. Moreover, the dribbet likely will lead gadston sales this quarter and hence the vrendel likely won\u2019t lead sales. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the dribbet isn\u2019t #1 in gadston sales this quarter, the toffen will be #1?",

            "content": "Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **The premise:** The dribbet is likely to be #1, followed by the vrendel, with the toffen significantly lower.\n2. **Additional information:** If the vrendel isn't #1, and the dribbet isn't #1, then the toffen will be #1.\n3. **Further information:** The dribbet is likely to be #1 this quarter, meaning the vrendel likely won't be #1.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* We know the dribbet is likely to be #1, so the vrendel is unlikely to be #1.\n* If the dribbet isn't #1, then the vrendel also isn't #1 (since it's less likely to be #1 than the dribbet).\n* If both the dribbet and vrendel aren't #1, then the toffen must be #1.\n\n**Therefore, it does follow that if the dribbet isn't #1 in gadston sales this quarter, the toffen will be #1.**\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
