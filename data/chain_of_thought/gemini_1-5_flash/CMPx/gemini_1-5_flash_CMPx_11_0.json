    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trenist, a lanken, and a draloid are shortlisted for Drij of the Year. The trenist is considered the front runner, followed by the lanken, while the draloid is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates in contention, if the lanken doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the trenist doesn\u2019t win it, the draloid will win it. Moreover, the trenist likely will win the award and hence the lanken likely won\u2019t win it. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trenist doesn\u2019t win Drij of the Year, the draloid will?",

            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **The premise:** We know the trenist is the front runner, the lanken is second, and the draloid is a long shot. This suggests the trenist is most likely to win, followed by the lanken, and the draloid is least likely.\n\n2. **The conditional statement:**  \"If the lanken doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the trenist doesn\u2019t win it, the draloid will win it.\" This is true because they are the only candidates, so if the top two don't win, the remaining candidate must win.\n\n3. **The additional information:** \"The trenist likely will win the award and hence the lanken likely won\u2019t win it.\" This reinforces the initial premise about the likelihood of each candidate winning.\n\n4. **The question:** \"Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trenist doesn\u2019t win Drij of the Year, the draloid will?\"\n\n5. **Reasoning:**  While the conditional statement is true, it doesn't necessarily mean the draloid is *likely* to win if the trenist doesn't. The trenist is the front runner, so it's more likely that the lanken would win if the trenist doesn't. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
