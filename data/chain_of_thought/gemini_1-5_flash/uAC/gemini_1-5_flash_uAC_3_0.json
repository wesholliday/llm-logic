It doesn't say that *only* James writes mystery novels, just that *if* James wrote it, it's a mystery novel.\n* Premise 2 tells us the book is a mystery novel, but it doesn't tell us who wrote it. \n* We can't infer that the book was written by James because there could be other authors who write mystery novels. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
