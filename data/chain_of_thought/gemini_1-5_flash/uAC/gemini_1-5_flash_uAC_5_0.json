It doesn't say Jeff *did* play basketball, only that *if* he did, then Amy played tennis.\n\n2. **The additional information:** \"Amy played tennis.\" This tells us the consequence of the conditional statement is true.\n\n3. **The question:** \"Can we infer that Jeff played basketball?\"  We need to determine if the truth of the consequence (Amy playing tennis) guarantees the truth of the antecedent (Jeff playing basketball).\n\n4. **Reasoning:**  The conditional statement doesn't work in reverse. Just because Amy played tennis doesn't automatically mean Jeff played basketball. There could be other reasons why Amy played tennis.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
