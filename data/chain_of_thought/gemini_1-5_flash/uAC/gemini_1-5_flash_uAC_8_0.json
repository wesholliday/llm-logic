This tells us the consequent of the conditional statement is true.\n3. **Inference:** We want to know if the vampire was awake. This is asking about the antecedent of the conditional statement.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* A conditional statement is only false if the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. \n* Since we know the consequent (mummy being awake) is true, the conditional statement could be true even if the antecedent (vampire being awake) is false. \n\n**Example:**\n\n* If it's raining (antecedent), then the ground is wet (consequent).\n* The ground is wet (consequent is true).\n* Does this mean it's raining (antecedent)? Not necessarily. The ground could be wet for other reasons.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
