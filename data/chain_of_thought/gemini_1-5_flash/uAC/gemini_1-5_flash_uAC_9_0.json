It tells us that Lisa buying the red shirt is a sufficient condition for Mark buying the blue shirt. However, it doesn't say that it's a necessary condition.\n* Premise 2 tells us that the consequent of the conditional statement (Mark buying the blue shirt) is true.\n* **The problem is that the conditional statement doesn't work in reverse.** Just because Mark bought the blue shirt doesn't necessarily mean Lisa bought the red shirt. There could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
