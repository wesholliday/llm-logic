It doesn't mean Ben *did* eat pasta, just that if he did, Kate ate salad.\n2. **The additional information:** \"Kate ate salad.\" This tells us the consequence of the conditional statement is true.\n3. **The question:** \"Can we infer that Ben ate pasta?\"  We need to determine if the truth of the consequence (Kate ate salad) guarantees the truth of the antecedent (Ben ate pasta).\n4. **Reasoning:**  The conditional statement doesn't work in reverse. Just because Kate ate salad doesn't automatically mean Ben ate pasta. There could be other reasons why Kate ate salad.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
