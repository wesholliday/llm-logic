It doesn't say that the cake *must* be chocolate if the muffins are blueberry, only that *if* the cake is chocolate, *then* the muffins are blueberry.\n* Premise 2 tells us the muffins are blueberry, which satisfies the consequence of the conditional statement in Premise 1.\n* However, this doesn't automatically mean the cake was chocolate. There could be other reasons why the muffins were blueberry. \n\n**Example:** The muffins could be blueberry because they were always blueberry, regardless of the cake's flavor.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
