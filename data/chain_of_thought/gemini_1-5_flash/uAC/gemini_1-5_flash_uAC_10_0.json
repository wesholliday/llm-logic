It doesn't necessarily mean the dog *must* be inside if the cat is outside. \n* Premise 2 confirms the cat was outside, but it doesn't tell us anything about the dog's location.\n* We can't definitively conclude that the dog was inside based on these premises alone. There could be other reasons why the cat was outside, and the dog might be elsewhere.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
