It doesn't say the doll *must* be plastic if the truck is metal. It only says that *if* the doll is plastic, *then* the truck is metal.\n* Premise 2 tells us the truck is metal. This aligns with the consequence of the conditional statement in Premise 1.\n* However, the truck being metal doesn't necessarily mean the doll is plastic. There could be other reasons why the truck is metal. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
