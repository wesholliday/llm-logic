It doesn't tell us definitively whether Mary was at the wedding, only that if she was, then Sue must have been too.\n* Premise 2 tells us that Sue was at the wedding. This confirms the consequence of the conditional statement in Premise 1.\n* However, the conditional statement doesn't work in reverse. Just because Sue was at the wedding doesn't automatically mean Mary was there. There could be other reasons why Sue was at the wedding.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
