This is the consequent of the conditional statement.\n3. **The question:** Can we infer that the alien visited Mars? This is asking if we can conclude the antecedent of the conditional statement is true.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* The fact that the robot visited Jupiter doesn't automatically mean the alien visited Mars. The conditional statement only tells us what happens *if* the alien visited Mars. \n* There could be other reasons why the robot visited Jupiter, unrelated to the alien's actions.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
