It doesn't say the apple *is* red, only that *if* it were red, then the banana would be yellow.\n\n2. **The additional information:** \"The banana was yellow.\" This tells us the consequence of the conditional statement is true.\n\n3. **The question:** \"Can we infer that the apple was red?\"  We need to determine if the truth of the consequence (banana being yellow) guarantees the truth of the antecedent (apple being red).\n\n4. **Reasoning:**  The conditional statement doesn't work in reverse. Just because the banana is yellow doesn't automatically mean the apple was red. There could be other reasons why the banana is yellow. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
