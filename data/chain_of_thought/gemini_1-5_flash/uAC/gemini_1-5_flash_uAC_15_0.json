It doesn't say that Sam *must* have taken a plane if Erin took a train. It only says that if Sam took a plane, then Erin *must* have taken a train.\n* Premise 2 confirms that Erin took a train.\n* However, this doesn't necessarily mean Sam took a plane. Erin could have taken a train for other reasons.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
