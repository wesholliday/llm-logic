It tells us that the presence of the griffin in the forest *implies* the presence of the unicorn. \n* Premise 2 tells us that the unicorn was indeed in the forest. \n* However, the conditional statement doesn't work in reverse. Just because the unicorn was in the forest doesn't automatically mean the griffin was there. There could be other reasons why the unicorn was in the forest.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
