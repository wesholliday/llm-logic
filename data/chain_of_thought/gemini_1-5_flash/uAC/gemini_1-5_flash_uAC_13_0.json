It doesn't say the car *must* be red if the truck is blue, only that *if* the car is red, *then* the truck is blue.\n* Premise 2 tells us the truck is blue, but it doesn't tell us anything about the car's color.\n* The fact that the truck is blue could be due to other reasons besides the car being red. \n\n**Therefore, we cannot infer that the car was red.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
