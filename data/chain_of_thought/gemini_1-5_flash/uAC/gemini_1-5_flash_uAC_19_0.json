It doesn't mean that Tom *must* have watched football if Jen watched basketball. It only means that if Tom *did* watch football, then Jen *must* have watched basketball.\n* Premise 2 tells us that Jen did watch basketball. This confirms one part of the conditional statement in Premise 1.\n* However, it doesn't tell us anything about whether Tom watched football. Jen could have watched basketball for other reasons.\n\n**Conclusion:** We cannot infer that Tom watched football.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
