It's an exclusive \"or\" meaning they can't be in both places.\n\n2. **The second statement:** \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet\" eliminates the first possibility.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** Since the keys can't be in the cabinet, and they must be in one of the two places, the only remaining possibility is that they are in the drawer.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
