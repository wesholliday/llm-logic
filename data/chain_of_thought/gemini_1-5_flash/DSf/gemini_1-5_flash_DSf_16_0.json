It's an exclusive \"or\", meaning it can't be in both places at the same time.\n\n2. **The additional information:** \"The pen isn't on my desk\" eliminates one of the possibilities.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** Since the pen can't be on the desk, and it must be in one of the two places, the only remaining possibility is that the pen is in the bag.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
