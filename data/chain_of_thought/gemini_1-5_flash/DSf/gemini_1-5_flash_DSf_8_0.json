It's an exclusive \"or\" meaning it can't be in both places.\n\n2. **The second statement:** \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch\" eliminates one of the possibilities.\n\n3. **Inference:** Since the remote control can't be under the couch, and it must be in one of the two places, the only remaining possibility is that it's on the coffee table.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
