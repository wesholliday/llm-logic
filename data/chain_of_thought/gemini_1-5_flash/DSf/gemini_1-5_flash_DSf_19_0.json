There's no possibility of it being somewhere else.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The watch isn't on his wrist.\" This directly contradicts one of the possibilities presented in Premise 1.\n\n3. **Inference:** Since the watch cannot be on his wrist (Premise 2), and it must be in one of the two states (Premise 1), the only remaining possibility is that **the watch is charging on the dresser**.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
