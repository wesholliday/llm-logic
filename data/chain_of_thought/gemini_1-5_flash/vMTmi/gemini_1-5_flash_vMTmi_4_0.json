If the robot didn't visit Jupiter, then the contrapositive of Premise 1 tells us the alien didn't visit Mars. \n* **Validity:**  The argument is valid because the conclusion follows logically from the premises. If the robot might not have visited Jupiter, then it's possible the alien didn't visit Mars.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
