It means that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf *must* be in the den. \n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The wolf might not have been in the den.\" This statement tells us that the wolf's presence in the den is uncertain. It doesn't definitively say the wolf wasn't there, but it leaves open the possibility.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"The bear was not in the cave.\"\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* The argument tries to use the uncertainty about the wolf's location to conclude that the bear wasn't in the cave. \n* However, the first premise only states what *must* happen if the bear is in the cave. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the wolf isn't in the den. \n* The wolf not being in the den doesn't automatically mean the bear wasn't in the cave. There could be other reasons why the wolf wasn't in the den.\n\n**Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
