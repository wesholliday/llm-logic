It means that if Alex finished, Chris *must* have also finished.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"Chris might not have finished the race.\" This statement tells us that it's possible Chris didn't finish. It doesn't definitively say he didn't finish, just that it's a possibility.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* **Premise 1 establishes a connection:** If Alex finished, Chris *must* have finished.\n* **Premise 2 introduces uncertainty:** It's possible Chris didn't finish.\n* **The conclusion is based on the possibility:** Since Chris *might* not have finished, and Alex finishing would require Chris to have finished, then Alex *could* not have finished.\n\n**Important Note:** This argument is not about certainty, but about the possibility of Alex finishing. The conclusion is valid because it aligns with the possibility introduced in Premise 2.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
