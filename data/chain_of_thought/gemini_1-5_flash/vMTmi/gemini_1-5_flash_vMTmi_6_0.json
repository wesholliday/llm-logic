It means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob's choice of pasta is a necessary consequence.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"Bob might not have chosen pasta.\" This statement introduces the possibility that Bob did not choose pasta. It doesn't definitively say he didn't, but it leaves that option open.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"Sue did not choose pizza.\"  This conclusion is drawn from the premises.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* **Premise 1 establishes a connection:** If Sue chose pizza, Bob *must* have chosen pasta. This creates a strong link between their choices.\n* **Premise 2 introduces uncertainty:**  Bob *might not* have chosen pasta. This uncertainty weakens the link established in premise 1.\n* **The conclusion is not guaranteed:**  Since Bob might not have chosen pasta, we cannot definitively conclude that Sue did not choose pizza. The conclusion relies on the assumption that Bob *did* choose pasta, which is not guaranteed by the premises.\n\n**Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
