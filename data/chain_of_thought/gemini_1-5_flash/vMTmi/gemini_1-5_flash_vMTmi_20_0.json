It means that if the apple was red, then the banana *must* be yellow. \n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The banana might not have been yellow.\" This statement tells us that the banana being yellow is not a certainty. It could have been yellow, but it also could have been another color.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"The apple was not red.\"\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* Premise 1 establishes a connection between the apple being red and the banana being yellow. It says that if the apple is red, the banana *must* be yellow.\n* Premise 2 tells us that the banana might not have been yellow. This means the condition set by Premise 1 might not have been met.\n* If the condition set by Premise 1 (the banana being yellow) is not met, then the antecedent (the apple being red) cannot be true. This is because the conditional statement says the banana *must* be yellow if the apple is red.\n\n**Therefore, the argument is logically valid.**\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
