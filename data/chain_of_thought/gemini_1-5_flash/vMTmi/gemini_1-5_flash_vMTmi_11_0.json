It means that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins *must* be blueberry. \n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The muffins might not have been blueberry.\" This statement tells us that it's possible the muffins were not blueberry. It doesn't definitively say they weren't blueberry, just that it's a possibility.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"The cake was not chocolate.\"\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* **Premise 1 establishes a connection:** If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins *must* be blueberry. This means if the muffins are *not* blueberry, then the cake cannot be chocolate.\n* **Premise 2 introduces doubt:** It tells us that the muffins *might not* have been blueberry. This doesn't mean they definitely weren't blueberry, but it does create a possibility that they weren't.\n* **The conclusion follows logically:** Since the muffins *might not* have been blueberry, and the cake being chocolate requires the muffins to be blueberry, then the cake cannot be chocolate.\n\n**Therefore, the argument is logically valid.**\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
