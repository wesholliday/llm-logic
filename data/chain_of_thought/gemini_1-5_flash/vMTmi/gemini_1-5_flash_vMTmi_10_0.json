It implies that if the dog was inside, the cat *must* be outside. \n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The cat might not have been outside.\" This statement doesn't definitively say the cat wasn't outside, but it leaves open the possibility that it wasn't.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"The dog was not inside.\"\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* Premise 1 establishes a connection between the dog being inside and the cat being outside. It's a strong connection, but not absolute.\n* Premise 2 weakens the connection established in Premise 1. It introduces the possibility that the cat wasn't outside, which means the condition in Premise 1 might not have been met.\n* The conclusion jumps to a definitive statement about the dog being inside. However, Premise 2 leaves open the possibility that the dog *could* have been inside, even if the cat wasn't outside.\n\n**Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.**  The conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premises.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
