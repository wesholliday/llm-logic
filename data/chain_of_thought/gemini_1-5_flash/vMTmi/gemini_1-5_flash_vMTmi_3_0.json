It says that if the first part (the book was written by James) is true, then the second part (the book must be a mystery novel) must also be true.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The book might not be a mystery novel.\" This statement tells us that the second part of the conditional statement in Premise 1 might be false.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"The book was not written by James.\" This conclusion is drawn from the premises.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* If the book is not a mystery novel, then the conditional statement in Premise 1 is false. \n* A conditional statement is only false when the first part is true and the second part is false.\n* Since Premise 2 tells us the second part might be false, it's possible that the first part (the book was written by James) is also false.\n\n**Therefore, the argument is logically valid.**\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
