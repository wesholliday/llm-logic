            "content": "Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement. It means that Mary's presence at the wedding necessitates Sue's presence.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"Sue might not have been at the wedding.\" This statement introduces the possibility that Sue was not at the wedding. It doesn't definitively say she wasn't there, but it leaves that possibility open.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" This conclusion is drawn from the premises.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe argument attempts to use the possibility of Sue's absence to conclude Mary's absence. However, the argument is not logically valid. Here's why:\n\n* **Premise 1 establishes a connection between Mary and Sue's presence at the wedding.**  It states that Mary's presence *requires* Sue's presence.\n* **Premise 2 only introduces the possibility of Sue's absence.** It doesn't definitively state that Sue was absent.\n* **The conclusion jumps to a definitive statement about Mary's absence.**  While Sue's potential absence weakens the case for Mary being there, it doesn't *prove* Mary was absent.\n\n**Example:** Imagine Mary and Sue are sisters.  The first premise could be true (if Mary is there, Sue is likely there too).  The second premise could also be true (maybe Sue had a prior commitment).  But this doesn't mean Mary wasn't at the wedding. She could have gone without Sue.\n\n**Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
