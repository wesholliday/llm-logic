It means that if Sam took a plane, then Erin *definitely* took a train. \n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"Erin might not have taken a train.\" This means there's a possibility that Erin didn't take a train. It doesn't definitively say she didn't.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* Premise 1 establishes a strong link between Sam taking a plane and Erin taking a train. \n* Premise 2 introduces the possibility that Erin *didn't* take a train. This possibility *could* break the link established in Premise 1. \n* However, the conclusion jumps to a definitive statement about Sam not taking a plane.  The possibility that Erin didn't take a train doesn't *necessarily* mean Sam didn't take a plane. There could be other scenarios where Sam took a plane and Erin didn't take a train (e.g., Erin took a car).\n\n**Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
