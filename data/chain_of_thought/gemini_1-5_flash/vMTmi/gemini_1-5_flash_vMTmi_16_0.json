It means that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants *must* be denim. \n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The pants might not have been denim.\" This statement tells us that the pants being denim is not a certainty. It could be denim, but it also could be something else.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"The shirt was not cotton.\"\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* **Premise 1 establishes a connection:** If the shirt is cotton, then the pants *must* be denim. This means that if the pants are *not* denim, then the shirt cannot be cotton.\n* **Premise 2 weakens the connection:**  The pants *might not* have been denim. This doesn't definitively say they weren't denim, but it leaves open the possibility.\n* **The conclusion is not guaranteed:**  While the conclusion seems plausible, it's not logically guaranteed.  The pants could have been denim, and the argument doesn't provide enough information to definitively say the shirt wasn't cotton.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
