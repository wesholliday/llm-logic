It implies that if the car is red, then the truck *must* be blue. \n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The truck might not have been blue.\" This statement doesn't definitively say the truck wasn't blue, but it allows for the possibility that it wasn't.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"The car was not red.\"\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* **Premise 1 establishes a connection between the car being red and the truck being blue.**  It doesn't say anything about what happens if the car isn't red.\n* **Premise 2 weakens the connection established in Premise 1.** It introduces the possibility that the truck wasn't blue, which means the condition set by Premise 1 might not have been met.\n* **The conclusion jumps to a definitive statement about the car's color.**  While Premise 2 weakens the link between the car's color and the truck's color, it doesn't definitively prove the car wasn't red.\n\n**Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.**  The premises don't provide enough evidence to guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
