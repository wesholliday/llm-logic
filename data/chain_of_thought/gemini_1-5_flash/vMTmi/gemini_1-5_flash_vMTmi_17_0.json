It means that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate *definitely* ate salad. \n2. **Premise 2:** \"Kate might not have eaten salad.\" This means it's possible Kate didn't eat salad. It doesn't definitively say she didn't.\n3. **Conclusion:** \"Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* The argument tries to use the possibility that Kate didn't eat salad to conclude that Ben didn't eat pasta. \n* However, Premise 1 only states what happens *if* Ben eats pasta. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Ben *doesn't* eat pasta. \n* It's possible that Ben didn't eat pasta, and Kate still didn't eat salad for a completely different reason. \n\n**Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
