This is asking if the antecedent of the conditional statement is true.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* The fact that the book is a mystery novel doesn't automatically mean it was written by James. There could be other mystery novel writers. \n* The conditional statement only tells us what happens *if* James wrote the book. It doesn't tell us what happens if the book is a mystery novel.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
