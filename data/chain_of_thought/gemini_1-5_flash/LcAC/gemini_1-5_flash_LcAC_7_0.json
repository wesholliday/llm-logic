It doesn't say anything about what happens if Alex *doesn't* finish.\n\n2. **We know \"Chris finished the race\".** This tells us something about Chris, but it doesn't directly tell us anything about Alex.\n\n3. **The conditional statement doesn't guarantee that Alex finished.**  The statement only says what happens *if* Alex finishes. It doesn't say that Alex *must* have finished. It's possible that Chris finished for some other reason, even if Alex didn't.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
