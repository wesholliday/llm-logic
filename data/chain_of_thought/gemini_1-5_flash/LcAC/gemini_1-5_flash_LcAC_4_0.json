Premise 2 is a simple statement.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of Modus Ponens:** Modus Ponens is a valid argument form that states:\n   - If P, then Q.\n   - P.\n   - Therefore, Q.\n\n4. **Match the premises to the form:**\n   - P: The alien visited Mars.\n   - Q: The robot visited Jupiter.\n\n5. **Determine if the conclusion follows:**  We have both \"If P, then Q\" and \"P\" (the premises). Therefore, we can logically conclude \"Q\" (the robot visited Jupiter). However, we cannot conclude \"P\" (the alien visited Mars).\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
