It doesn't say the bear *was* in the cave, only that *if* it was, then the wolf was in the den.\n\n2. **The second statement:** \"The wolf was in the den.\" This confirms the consequence of the conditional statement.\n\n3. **The question:** Can we conclude \"The bear was in the cave\"?  \n\n4. **Reasoning:**  The conditional statement doesn't guarantee the bear was in the cave. The wolf being in the den could be due to other reasons. The statement only tells us what *must* be true if the bear was in the cave. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
