It only states that if Tom watched football, then Jen would have watched basketball.\n   - Premise 2 tells us that Jen watched basketball, but it doesn't tell us anything about whether Tom watched football.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - We cannot logically conclude that Tom watched football based on the given premises.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
