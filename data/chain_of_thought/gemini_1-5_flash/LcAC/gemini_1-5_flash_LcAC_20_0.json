This is known as the **affirming the consequent fallacy**.\n\n2. **Understand the fallacy:**  Affirming the consequent means that just because the consequence is true (the banana is yellow), it doesn't necessarily mean the antecedent (the apple is red) is also true. There could be other reasons why the banana is yellow.\n\n3. **Example:** Imagine the apple was green. The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" would still be true, because the banana being yellow doesn't depend on the apple's color.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
