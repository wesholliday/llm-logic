This is known as the **affirming the consequent fallacy**.\n\n2. **Understand the fallacy:**  Affirming the consequent means that just because the consequent (the truck being blue) is true, it doesn't necessarily mean the antecedent (the car being red) is also true. There could be other reasons why the truck is blue.\n\n3. **Example:** Imagine the car could be any color, and the truck is blue because it's a specific model that always comes in blue. The fact that the truck is blue doesn't tell us anything about the car's color.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
