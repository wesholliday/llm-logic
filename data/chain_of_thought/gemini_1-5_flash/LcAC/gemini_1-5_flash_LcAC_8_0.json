It tells us that the vampire being awake is a sufficient condition for the mummy being awake. \n2. **Premise 2:** \"The mummy was awake.\" This tells us the consequence of the conditional statement is true.\n3. **Conclusion:** \"The vampire was awake.\" This is what we are trying to determine if we can logically conclude.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* We know the mummy was awake (Premise 2).\n* The conditional statement (Premise 1) says that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would be awake.\n* However, the conditional statement doesn't say anything about what happens if the mummy is awake. It only tells us what happens if the vampire is awake.\n* It's possible that the mummy was awake for other reasons, not because the vampire was awake.\n\n**Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the vampire was awake.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
