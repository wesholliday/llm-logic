It doesn't say the griffin *was* in the forest, only that *if* it was, then the unicorn was also there.\n\n2. **The second statement:** \"The unicorn was in the forest.\" This tells us the consequence of the conditional statement is true.\n\n3. **The question:** Can we conclude \"The griffin was in the forest\"?  \n\n4. **Reasoning:**  The conditional statement doesn't guarantee the griffin was in the forest. The unicorn could have been there for other reasons.  The statement only says *if* the griffin was there, then the unicorn would be too.  We know the unicorn was there, but that doesn't mean the griffin had to be.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
