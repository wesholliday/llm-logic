The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n3. **Applying the contrapositive:**  The contrapositive of our original statement is \"If the book is a mystery novel (not Q), then the book was not written by James (not P)\".\n\n4. **Inference:** Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
