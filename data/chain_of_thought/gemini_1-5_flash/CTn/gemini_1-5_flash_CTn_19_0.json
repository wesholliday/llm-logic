The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n4. **Applying the contrapositive:** The contrapositive of the original statement is \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"\n5. **Conclusion:** Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the contrapositive.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
