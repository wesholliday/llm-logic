The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n3. **Applying the contrapositive:**  The contrapositive of our original statement is \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave\". \n4. **Conclusion:** Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the contrapositive.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
