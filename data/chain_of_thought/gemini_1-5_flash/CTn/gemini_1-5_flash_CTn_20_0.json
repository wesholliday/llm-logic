The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n3. **Apply the contrapositive to the original statement:** The contrapositive of \"If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow\" is \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red\".\n\n4. **Determine if the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement:**  A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they have the same truth value.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
