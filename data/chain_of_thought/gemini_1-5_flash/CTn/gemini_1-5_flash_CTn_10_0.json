The original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.\n4. **Finding the contrapositive:** The contrapositive of \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was not outside\" is \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside.\"\n5. **Conclusion:** Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the contrapositive.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
