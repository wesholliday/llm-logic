It doesn't say anything about what happens if Sue is at the wedding.\n3. **The question:** \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\" This is the converse of the original statement. \n4. **Converse vs. Original:** The converse of a conditional statement is not always true, even if the original statement is true.  \n5. **Example:** Consider the statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" This is true. However, the converse \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining\" is not always true (the ground could be wet from other sources).\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
