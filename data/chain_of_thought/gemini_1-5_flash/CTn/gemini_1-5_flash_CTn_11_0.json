The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the antecedent and consequent and switching their positions.\n\n4. **Apply the rule of contraposition:** The contrapositive of a true statement is always true. This means that if the original statement is true, then the desired inference is also true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
