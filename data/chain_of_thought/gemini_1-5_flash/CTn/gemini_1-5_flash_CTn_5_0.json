The contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and switching their order.  So, the contrapositive of our original statement is \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\".\n\n3. **Determine if the inference is valid:** Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
