This is asking if the opposite relationship is also true.\n4. **Reasoning:** If Lucy went to the zoo, it means Joe *did not* go to the park (because the original statement says Joe going to the park prevents Lucy from going to the zoo). \n5. **Conclusion:**  The opposite relationship is true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
