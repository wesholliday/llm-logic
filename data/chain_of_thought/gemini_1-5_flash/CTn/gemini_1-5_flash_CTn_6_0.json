The original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.\n4. **Finding the contrapositive:** The contrapositive of \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta\" is \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n5. **Conclusion:** Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the contrapositive.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
