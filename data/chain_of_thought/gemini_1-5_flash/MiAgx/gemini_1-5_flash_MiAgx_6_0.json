The second statement says \"It *might* be that the wobble is flonk zizz and the flimble flibbits at zazzle snorkel.\" This also means it's possible, but not certain, that both events happen. Since both statements express the same level of uncertainty, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
