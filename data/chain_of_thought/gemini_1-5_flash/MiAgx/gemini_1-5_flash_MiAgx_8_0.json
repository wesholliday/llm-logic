The second statement says \"It might be that the zizz is snizzle on quank and the wibble wumps fizzle quimble.\" This statement is also about possibility, and it's essentially saying the same thing as the first statement.  Since both statements express the same idea of possibility, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
