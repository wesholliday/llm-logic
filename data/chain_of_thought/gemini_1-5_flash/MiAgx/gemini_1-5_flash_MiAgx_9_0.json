The statement \"It might be that the wump is quank and the snorkel is snizzle\" is simply a rephrasing of the original statement, stating that the combination of the wump being quank and the snorkel being snizzle is a possibility. Since the original statement already implies this possibility, we can infer the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
