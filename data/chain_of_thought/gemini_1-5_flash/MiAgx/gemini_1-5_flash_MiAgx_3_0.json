The second statement, \"It might be that the blimp is in the wozzle and the flonk quibbles plonk,\" is simply a rephrasing of the first statement. It's saying that it's possible both events happen. Since the second statement is just a rewording of the first, we can infer it from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
