The statement \"It might be that the plimp is wozzle by flonk and the fizzle is fribble gribble\" also implies that both events are possible. Since the first statement implies the possibility of both events, and the second statement also implies the possibility of both events, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
