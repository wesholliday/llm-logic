This means it's possible, but not certain, that both events happen. The second statement says \"it *might* be that the zump is quorple and the snizzle wibbles froodle zibber\". This also means it's possible, but not certain, that both events happen. Since both statements express the same possibility, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
