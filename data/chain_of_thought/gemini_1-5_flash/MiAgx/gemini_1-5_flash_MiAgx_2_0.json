The statement \"It might be that the frazzle is on the zump and the gribble wozzles a frazzle grooble\" also implies that both events are possible. Since the first statement implies the possibility of both events, and the second statement also implies the possibility of both events, we can infer the second statement from the first. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
