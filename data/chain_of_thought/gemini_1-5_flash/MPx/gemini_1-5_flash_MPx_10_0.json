Premise 2 affirms the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional statement.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of Modus Ponens:** This rule of logic states that if you have a conditional statement and you know the antecedent is true, then you can infer the consequent (the \"then\" part) is also true.\n\n4. **Apply Modus Ponens to our premises:** Since we know the wug was sproinged (antecedent is true), and the conditional statement says \"if the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled,\" we can infer that the wug was garpled (consequent is true).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
