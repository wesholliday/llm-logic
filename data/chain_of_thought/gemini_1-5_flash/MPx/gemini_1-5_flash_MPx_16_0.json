It states that if the first part (the sneg was crampled) is true, then the second part (the sneg sproted the frink) must also be true.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of inference:**  This scenario fits the pattern of *modus ponens*.  Modus ponens is a valid argument form that says:\n   - If P, then Q.\n   - P is true.\n   - Therefore, Q is true.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since we have both the conditional statement (Premise 1) and the antecedent (Premise 2) being true, we can infer that the consequent (the sneg sproted the frink) is also true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
