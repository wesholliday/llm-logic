Premise 2 states the condition of the conditional statement is true.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of inference:**  The rule of inference called *modus ponens* states that if a conditional statement is true and its antecedent (the \"if\" part) is true, then the consequent (the \"then\" part) must also be true.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the condition (\"the twonk was plinked\") is true, and the conditional statement (\"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\") is true, we can infer that the consequent (\"it was varnished\") is also true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
