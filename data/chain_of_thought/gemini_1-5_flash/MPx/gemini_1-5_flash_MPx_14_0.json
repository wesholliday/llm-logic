It states that if the first part (the clug was fleeked) is true, then the second part (the clug snugged) must also be true.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of inference:**  The rule of inference we can use here is called **Modus Ponens**.  Modus Ponens states:\n   - If P, then Q.\n   - P is true.\n   - Therefore, Q is true.\n\n4. **Match the premises to the rule:**\n   - P: The clug was fleeked.\n   - Q: The clug snugged.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since we have both premises (P and \"If P, then Q\") we can conclude that Q is true.  Therefore, we can infer that \"The clug snugged.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
