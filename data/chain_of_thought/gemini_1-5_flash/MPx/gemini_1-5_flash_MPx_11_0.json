It states that if the first part (the flug was blummed) is true, then the second part (the flug was zimmed) must also be true.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of inference:**  We can use the rule of Modus Ponens. This rule states that if we have a conditional statement (like Premise 1) and we know the first part is true (Premise 2), then we can infer that the second part is also true.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since we know the flug was blummed (Premise 2), and the conditional statement (Premise 1) tells us that if the flug was blummed, then it was zimmed, we can infer that the flug was zimmed.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
