It states that if the first part (the flugel was blimmed) is true, then the second part (the flugel was zargled) must also be true.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of inference:**  We can use the rule of Modus Ponens. This rule states that if we have a conditional statement (if p then q) and we know that p is true, then we can infer that q is also true.\n\n4. **Apply the rule to our premises:**\n   - Our conditional statement is \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\"\n   - We know that \"The flugel was blimmed\" is true (Premise 2).\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we can infer that \"The flugel was zargled\" is also true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
