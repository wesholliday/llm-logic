Premise 2 affirms the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional statement.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of inference:** This scenario matches the structure of *modus ponens*, a valid rule of inference. Modus ponens states:\n   - If P, then Q.\n   - P.\n   - Therefore, Q.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the premises match the structure of modus ponens, we can infer the consequent (the \"then\" part) of the conditional statement.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
