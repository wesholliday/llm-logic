Premise 2 affirms the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional statement.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of Modus Ponens:**  Modus Ponens is a valid argument form that states:\n   - If P, then Q.\n   - P.\n   - Therefore, Q.\n\n4. **Match the premises to the form:**\n   - P: The glip was slogged.\n   - Q: The glip was tragged.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since we have both the antecedent (P) and the conditional statement (If P, then Q), we can infer the consequent (Q).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
