Premise 2 affirms the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional statement.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of Modus Ponens:**  Modus Ponens is a valid argument form that states:\n   - If P, then Q.\n   - P.\n   - Therefore, Q.\n\n4. **Match the premises to the form:**\n   - P: The fleeg was bluttered.\n   - Q: The fleeg surned.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since the premises match the Modus Ponens form, we can infer the consequent (the \"then\" part), which is \"The fleeg surned.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
