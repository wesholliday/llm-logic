It tells us that Joe going to the park is a sufficient condition for Lucy going to the zoo. \n* However, it doesn't tell us that Joe going to the park is a necessary condition for Lucy going to the zoo. \n* Lucy could have gone to the zoo for other reasons, unrelated to Joe's actions.\n\n**Conclusion:** We cannot infer that Joe went to the park.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
