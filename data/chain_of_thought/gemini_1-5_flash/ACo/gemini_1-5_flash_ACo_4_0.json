It tells us that the alien visiting Mars is a sufficient condition for the robot visiting Jupiter. \n* Premise 1 tells us that the robot did visit Jupiter. \n* However, the robot visiting Jupiter could be due to other reasons besides the alien visiting Mars. The conditional statement doesn't say that the alien visiting Mars is the *only* reason the robot could visit Jupiter.\n\n**Conclusion:** We cannot infer that the alien visited Mars.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
