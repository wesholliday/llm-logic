It tells us that if the first part (Sam took a plane) is true, then the second part (Erin took a train) must also be true.\n* Premise 1 tells us that the second part of the conditional statement is true.\n* However, the truth of the second part of a conditional statement does not guarantee the truth of the first part. For example, Erin could have taken the train for other reasons besides Sam taking a plane.\n\n**Therefore, we cannot infer that Sam took a plane.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
