It says that Lisa buying the red shirt is a sufficient condition for Mark buying the blue shirt. \n* However, it doesn't say that Lisa buying the red shirt is a necessary condition for Mark buying the blue shirt. \n* Mark could have bought the blue shirt for other reasons, regardless of whether Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\n**Conclusion:** We cannot infer that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
