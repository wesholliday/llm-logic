It tells us that the vampire being awake is a sufficient condition for the mummy being awake. However, it doesn't tell us that it's a necessary condition. \n* The mummy could be awake for other reasons besides the vampire being awake. \n* Therefore, we cannot infer that the vampire was awake based on the given premises.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
