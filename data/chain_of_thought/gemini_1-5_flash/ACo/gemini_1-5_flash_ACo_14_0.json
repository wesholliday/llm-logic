It says that if the bear is in the cave (the antecedent), then the wolf is in the den (the consequent).\n\n4. **Analyze the relationship between the premises:** Premise 1 tells us the consequent of Premise 2 is true (the wolf is in the den). \n\n5. **Apply the rule of Modus Ponens:**  Modus Ponens is a valid argument form that states: If P, then Q. P is true. Therefore, Q is true.  \n\n6. **In our case:**  P is \"The bear was in the cave\" and Q is \"The wolf was in the den.\"  We know Q is true (from Premise 1), but we cannot conclude that P is true. \n\n7. **Why we can't infer P:**  The wolf being in the den could be due to other reasons besides the bear being in the cave.  The wolf might be in the den because it's its usual home, or for some other reason entirely.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
