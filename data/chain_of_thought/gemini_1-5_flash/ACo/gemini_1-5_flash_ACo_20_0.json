It tells us that if the apple was red, then a certain consequence (the banana being yellow) would follow.\n* Premise 1 tells us that the consequence (the banana being yellow) is true.\n* However, the truth of the consequence alone doesn't guarantee the truth of the antecedent (the apple being red). \n* There could be other reasons why the banana was yellow. For example, it could have been yellow even if the apple wasn't red.\n\n**Therefore, we cannot infer that the apple was red.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
