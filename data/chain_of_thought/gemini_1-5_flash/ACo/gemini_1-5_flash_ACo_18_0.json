It tells us that if the doll was plastic, then a certain consequence (the truck being metal) would follow.\n* Premise 1 tells us that the consequence (the truck being metal) is true.\n* However, the conditional statement doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the doll *wasn't* plastic. The truck could still be metal even if the doll wasn't plastic. \n\n**Therefore, we cannot infer that the doll was plastic.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
