It tells us that Mary's presence at the wedding is a sufficient condition for Sue's presence. \n* However, it doesn't tell us that Mary's presence is a necessary condition for Sue's presence. \n* Sue could have been at the wedding for other reasons, even if Mary wasn't. \n\n**Therefore, we cannot infer that Mary was at the wedding.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
