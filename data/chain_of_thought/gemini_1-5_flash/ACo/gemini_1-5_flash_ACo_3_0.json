It says that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. \n* Premise 1 tells us the book is a mystery novel. \n* However, just because the book is a mystery novel doesn't automatically mean it was written by James. There could be other authors who write mystery novels. \n\n**Conclusion:** We cannot infer that the book was written by James.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
