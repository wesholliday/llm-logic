It doesn't tell us whether the cake was chocolate, but it does tell us that if the cake *was* chocolate, then the muffins *must* be blueberry.\n3. **Inference:** We are asked if we can infer \"The cake was chocolate.\"  \n4. **Reasoning:**  Premise 1 tells us the muffins were blueberry. Premise 2 says that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would be blueberry. Since the muffins *are* blueberry, this doesn't necessarily mean the cake *must* be chocolate. There could be other reasons why the muffins are blueberry. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
