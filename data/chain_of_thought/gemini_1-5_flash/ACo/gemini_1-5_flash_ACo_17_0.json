It tells us that Ben eating pasta is a sufficient condition for Kate eating salad. \n* However, it doesn't tell us that Ben eating pasta is a necessary condition for Kate eating salad. \n* Kate could have eaten salad for other reasons, not just because Ben ate pasta. \n* Therefore, we cannot infer that Ben ate pasta.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
