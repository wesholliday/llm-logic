It tells us that Alex finishing the race is a sufficient condition for Chris finishing the race. \n* However, it doesn't tell us that Alex finishing the race is a necessary condition for Chris finishing the race. \n* Chris could have finished the race for other reasons, even if Alex didn't. \n\n**Example:** Imagine Chris and Alex are in a relay race. Chris runs the final leg and finishes the race. Alex ran an earlier leg, but didn't finish the race.  \n\n**Conclusion:** We cannot infer that Alex finished the race.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
