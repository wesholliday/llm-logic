It tells us that Jeff playing basketball is a sufficient condition for Amy playing tennis. \n* However, it doesn't tell us that Jeff playing basketball is a necessary condition for Amy playing tennis. \n* Amy could have played tennis for other reasons, not just because Jeff played basketball. \n* Therefore, we cannot infer that Jeff played basketball.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
