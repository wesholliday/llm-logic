It says that if Tom watched football, then a certain consequence (Jen watching basketball) must follow.\n* Premise 1 tells us that the consequence (Jen watching basketball) is true.\n* However, the conditional statement doesn't guarantee that the antecedent (Tom watching football) is true. It only says what happens *if* the antecedent is true.\n* There could be other reasons why Jen watched basketball, unrelated to Tom watching football.\n\n**Therefore, we cannot infer that Tom watched football.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
