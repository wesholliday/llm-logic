It doesn't tell us whether the shirt was actually cotton, only that if it *were* cotton, then the pants would be denim.\n\n3. **The question:** Can we infer \"The shirt was cotton\"?  \n\n4. **Reasoning:**  We know the pants were denim (from Premise 1).  Premise 2 tells us that if the shirt was cotton, the pants would be denim. Since the pants *are* denim, this doesn't necessarily mean the shirt *must* be cotton. There could be other reasons why the pants are denim.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
