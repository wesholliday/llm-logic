It tells us that if the dog was inside, then a certain consequence (the cat being outside) follows.\n* Premise 1 tells us that the consequence (the cat being outside) is true.\n* However, the conditional statement doesn't guarantee that the dog was inside. It only states what happens *if* the dog was inside. \n* The cat being outside could be due to other reasons, not just the dog being inside.\n\n**Therefore, we cannot infer that the dog was inside.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
