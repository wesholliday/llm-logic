The statement \"The meeting might be scheduled or cancelled\" also implies a possibility of the meeting not happening, but it also includes the possibility of the meeting happening. Since the first statement only implies the possibility of the meeting not happening, it does not necessarily include the possibility of the meeting happening. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
