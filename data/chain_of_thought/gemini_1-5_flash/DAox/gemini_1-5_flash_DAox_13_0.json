The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of Premise 2 is \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged.\"\n\n5. **Applying the contrapositive:** Since we know the glip was not slogged (Premise 1), and the contrapositive of Premise 2 tells us that if the glip was not tragged, then it was not slogged, we can infer that the glip was not tragged.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
