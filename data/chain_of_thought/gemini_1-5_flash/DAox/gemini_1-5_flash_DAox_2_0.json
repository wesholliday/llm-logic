It tells us that if the wug was flooped, then a certain consequence (bimming the zoint) follows. However, Premise 1 tells us the antecedent (the wug being flooped) is false. \n\n5. **Modus Tollens:**  We can use the logical rule of Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens states: If P then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P. \n\n6. **Applying Modus Tollens:**\n    * P: The wug was flooped.\n    * Q: The wug bimmed the zoint.\n    * Not Q: The wug did not bim the zoint.\n\n7. **Conclusion:** Since we know \"The wug did not bim the zoint\" (not Q), and we have the conditional statement \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint\" (If P then Q), we can infer \"The wug was not flooped\" (not P).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
