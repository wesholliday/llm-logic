It tells us that if the sneg was crampled, then a certain consequence (sproting the frink) follows. However, Premise 1 tells us that the condition (the sneg being crampled) is false. \n5. **Modus Tollens:**  We can use a logical rule called Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens states: If P then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n6. **Applying Modus Tollens:** In our case, P is \"the sneg was crampled\" and Q is \"the sneg sproted the frink\". We know \"not Q\" (the sneg did not sprot the frink) because the condition (P) is false. \n7. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we can infer \"The sneg did not sprot the frink\".\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
