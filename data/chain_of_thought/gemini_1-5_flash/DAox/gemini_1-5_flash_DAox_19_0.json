It means that if the first part is true (the smonk was vreebled), then the second part must also be true (the smonk plagged).\n\n3. **Reasoning:** Since we know from Premise 1 that the smonk was *not* vreebled, the conditional statement in Premise 2 doesn't apply. The conditional statement only tells us what would happen *if* the smonk was vreebled, but it doesn't tell us anything about what happens when the smonk is *not* vreebled.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** We cannot infer that \"The smonk was not plagged\" from the given premises. The premises don't provide any information about whether the smonk plagged or not when it wasn't vreebled.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
