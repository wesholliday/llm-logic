It says that if the whiffle was shanked, then a certain consequence (tinking) must follow.\n* Premise 1 tells us the antecedent (the whiffle being shanked) is false.\n* When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the statement itself is considered true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent (the whiffle tinked).\n* Since the antecedent is false, we cannot conclude anything about the truth value of the consequent. It's possible the whiffle tinked, even though it wasn't shanked.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
