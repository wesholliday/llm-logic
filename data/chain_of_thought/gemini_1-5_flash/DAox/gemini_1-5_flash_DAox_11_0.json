It tells us that if the flug was blummed, then a certain consequence (being zimmed) follows.\n* Premise 1 tells us the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional statement is false. \n* When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the statement itself is considered true, regardless of whether the consequent (the \"then\" part) is true or false. \n* Since the antecedent is false, we cannot conclude anything about the consequent. It's possible the flug was zimmed, and it's possible it wasn't.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
