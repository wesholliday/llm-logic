It says that if the flugel was blimmed (the antecedent), then it was zargled (the consequent).\n* Since the antecedent (the flugel being blimmed) is false (from Premise 1), we cannot conclude anything about the consequent (the flugel being zargled).  The conditional statement doesn't tell us what happens if the flugel is *not* blimmed.\n\n**Therefore, we cannot infer that the flugel was not zargled.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
