The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5. **Combine Premise 1 and the contrapositive of Premise 2:** We know the zinger was not fraggled (Premise 1), and we know that if the zinger was not smoogled, then it was not fraggled (contrapositive of Premise 2).\n\n6. **Conclusion:** Since the zinger was not fraggled, and the only way it could not be fraggled is if it was not smoogled, we can infer that the zinger was not smoogled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
