It says that if the first part (the wug was sproinged) is true, then the second part (it was garpled) must also be true. \n4. **Applying the reasoning:** Since we know from Premise 1 that the first part of the conditional statement (the wug was sproinged) is false, we cannot conclude anything about the second part (it was garpled).  The conditional statement only tells us what happens if the first part is true. \n5. **Conclusion:** We cannot infer \"The wug was not garpled\" from the given premises.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
