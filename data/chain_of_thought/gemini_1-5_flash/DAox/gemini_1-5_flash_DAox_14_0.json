The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of Premise 2 is \"If the clug did not snug, then the clug was not fleeked.\"\n\n5. **Applying the contrapositive:** Since we know the clug was not fleeked (Premise 1), and the contrapositive of Premise 2 tells us that if the clug didn't snug it wasn't fleeked, we can infer that the clug did not snug.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
