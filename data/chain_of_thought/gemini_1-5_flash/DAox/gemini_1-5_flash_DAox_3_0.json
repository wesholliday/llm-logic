It says that if the antecedent (the splat was morphed) is true, then the consequent (the splat quanked) is also true. \n5. **Applying Modus Tollens:**  Premise 1 tells us the antecedent is false. Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that says if a conditional statement is true and its antecedent is false, then its consequent must also be false. \n6. **Conclusion:** Since the antecedent of Premise 2 is false (the splat was not morphed), we can infer that the consequent is also false (the splat did not quank).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
