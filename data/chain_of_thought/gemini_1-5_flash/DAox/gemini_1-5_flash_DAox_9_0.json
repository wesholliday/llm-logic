So the contrapositive of Premise 2 is \"If the twonk was not varnished, then it was not plinked.\"\n\n5. **Combine the contrapositive with Premise 1:**  We know the twonk was not plinked (Premise 1).  And we know that if the twonk was not varnished, then it was not plinked (contrapositive of Premise 2).  Therefore, we can conclude that the twonk was not varnished.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
