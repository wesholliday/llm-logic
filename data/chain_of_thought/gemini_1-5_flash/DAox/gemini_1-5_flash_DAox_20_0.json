It tells us that if the antecedent (the fleeg was bluttered) is true, then the consequent (it surned) must also be true. \n5. **However, Premise 1 tells us the antecedent is false (the fleeg was not bluttered).** \n6. **Since the antecedent is false, we cannot conclude anything about the consequent.**  The conditional statement doesn't tell us what happens if the antecedent is false. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
