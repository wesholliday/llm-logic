So the contrapositive of Premise 2 is \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\n5. **Combine the contrapositive with Premise 1:**  We know the dreb was not vroombed (Premise 1).  And we know that if the dreb was not spened, then it was not vroombed (contrapositive of Premise 2).  Therefore, it must be true that the dreb was not spened.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
