            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the original statement:** \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled.\" This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and Q is \"the sprocket was not daggled\".\n\n2. **Understand the concept of contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis (P) and the conclusion (Q) and switching their positions. So, the contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n3. **Apply the contrapositive to the original statement:** The contrapositive of our original statement is \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\".\n\n4. **Determine if the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement:**  A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they have the same truth value. If one is true, the other is also true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
