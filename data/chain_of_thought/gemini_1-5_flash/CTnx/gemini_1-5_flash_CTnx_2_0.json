The converse of a true statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Consider a counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where the wug could be flooped and bim the zoint at the same time. This would make the original statement true (since the wug didn't bim the zoint) but the converse false (since the wug was flooped even though it bimmed the zoint).\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
