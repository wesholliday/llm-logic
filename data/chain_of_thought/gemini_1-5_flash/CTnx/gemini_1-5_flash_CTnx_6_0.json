The contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then switching their order. \n\n3. **Applying Contrapositive:**  The contrapositive of the original statement is \"If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
