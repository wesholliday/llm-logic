The contrapositive of our original statement is \"If the fleeg surned, then it was not bluttered\".\n\n3. **Equivalence:** A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they have the same truth value. If one is true, the other is also true. If one is false, the other is also false.\n\n4. **Inference:** Since the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
