This means they have the same truth value. If one is true, the other is also true. If one is false, the other is also false.\n\n4. **Apply the equivalence:** Since the desired inference is the contrapositive of the original statement, and they are logically equivalent, we can infer the desired statement from the original statement.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
