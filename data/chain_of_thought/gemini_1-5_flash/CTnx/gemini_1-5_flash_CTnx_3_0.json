The contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and switching their order.  So, the contrapositive of our original statement is \"If the splat quanked, then the splat was not morphed.\"\n\n3. **Inference:** Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
