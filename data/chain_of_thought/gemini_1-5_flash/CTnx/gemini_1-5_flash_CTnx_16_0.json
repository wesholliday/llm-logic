The converse of a true statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Consider a counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where the sneg sproted the frink, but it was also crampled. This scenario satisfies the original statement (since the sneg didn't sproted the frink) but contradicts the desired inference.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
