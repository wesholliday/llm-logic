The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n3. **Applying the contrapositive:**  The contrapositive of our original statement is \"If the twonk was varnished (not Q), then the twonk was not plinked (not P)\".\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the statement \"If the twonk was varnished, then the twonk was not plinked\".\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
