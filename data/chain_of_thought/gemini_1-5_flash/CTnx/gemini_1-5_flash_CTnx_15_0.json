The converse of a true statement is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **Consider a counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where a dreb can be both vroombed and spened. This would make the original statement true (since it only says if it's vroombed, it's not spened, not the other way around). However, it would make the converse false, since it's possible for a dreb to be spened and still be vroombed.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
