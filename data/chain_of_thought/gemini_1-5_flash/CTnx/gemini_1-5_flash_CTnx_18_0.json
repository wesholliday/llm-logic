It means that if the shank is plooked, it cannot be nugged.\n\n2. **Contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then switching their order. \n\n3. **Finding the contrapositive:** The contrapositive of \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was not nugged\" is \"If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
