It is formed by negating both the hypothesis (P) and the conclusion (Q) and switching their order. \n   * Negation of P: The clug was not fleeked.\n   * Negation of Q: The clug snugged.\n   * Contrapositive: \"If the clug snugged, then the clug was not fleeked.\"\n\n3. **Inference:** Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
