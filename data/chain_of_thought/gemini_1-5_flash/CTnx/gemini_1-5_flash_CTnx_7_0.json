The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n3. **Form the contrapositive of the original statement:**  The contrapositive of our original statement is \"If the whiffle did tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\".\n\n4. **Compare the contrapositive to the inferred statement:** The inferred statement is exactly the same as the contrapositive we just derived.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since the inferred statement is the contrapositive of the original statement, and contrapositives are logically equivalent, we can infer the statement.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
