            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the original statement:** \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink.\" This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and Q is \"the fribble did not crink\".\n\n2. **Understand the concept of contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis (P) and the conclusion (Q) and switching their positions. So, the contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n3. **Apply the contrapositive to the original statement:**  The contrapositive of our original statement is \"If the fribble did crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\".\n\n4. **Determine if the contrapositive is logically equivalent:** A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they have the same truth value. If one is true, the other is also true.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer it.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
