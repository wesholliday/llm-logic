It means that if the doll is plastic, the truck *must* be metal. \n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The truck was not metal.\" This directly contradicts the consequence of the conditional statement in premise 1.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"The doll was not plastic.\" This conclusion follows logically from the premises. If the truck wasn't metal, then the doll couldn't have been plastic (because premise 1 states that a plastic doll *requires* a metal truck).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
