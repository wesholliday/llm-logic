It states:\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * Not Q.\n    * Therefore, not P.\n3. **Apply the form to the argument:**\n    * P: The shirt was cotton.\n    * Q: The pants were denim.\n    * The argument follows the modus tollens form exactly.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the argument follows a valid form, it is logically valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
