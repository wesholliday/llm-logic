This form looks like:\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * Not Q.\n    * Therefore, not P.\n\n2. **Apply the form to the given argument:**\n    * P: The bear was in the cave.\n    * Q: The wolf was in the den.\n    * Not Q: The wolf was not in the den.\n    * Not P: The bear was not in the cave.\n\n3. **Determine if the argument is valid:**  Modus tollens is a logically valid argument form. This means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
