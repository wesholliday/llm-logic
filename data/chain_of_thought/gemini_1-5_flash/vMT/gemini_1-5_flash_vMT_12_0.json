            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the argument:** The argument is a conditional statement (if-then) followed by a negation of the consequent (the 'then' part) and concluding with the negation of the antecedent (the 'if' part). \n2. **Identifying the form:** This form of argument is known as *modus tollens*.\n3. **Modus Tollens Validity:** Modus tollens is a logically valid argument form. This means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. \n4. **Applying to the example:** In this case, the premises are:\n    * If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n    * Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n    * The conclusion is: Joe did not go to the park.\n5. **Conclusion:** Since the argument follows the valid modus tollens form, it is logically valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
