This is a classic example of a logical structure called *modus tollens*.\n\n2. **Modus Tollens:** Modus tollens is a valid argument form. It states:\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * Not Q.\n    * Therefore, not P.\n\n3. **Applying Modus Tollens to the argument:**\n    * P: Alex finished the race.\n    * Q: Chris finished the race.\n    * The argument follows the modus tollens structure.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
