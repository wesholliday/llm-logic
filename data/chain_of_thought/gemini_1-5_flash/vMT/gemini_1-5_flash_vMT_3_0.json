This form of argument has the following structure:\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * Not Q.\n    * Therefore, not P.\n\n2. **Apply the form to the given argument:**\n    * P: The book was written by James.\n    * Q: The book is a mystery novel.\n    * Not Q: The book is not a mystery novel.\n    * Not P: The book was not written by James.\n\n3. **Determine if the argument is valid:**  Modus tollens is a logically valid argument form. This means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
