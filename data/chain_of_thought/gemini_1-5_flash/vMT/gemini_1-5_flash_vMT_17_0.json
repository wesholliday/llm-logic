This pattern is known as **Modus Tollens**.\n\n2. **Modus Tollens:** Modus Tollens is a valid argument form. It states:\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * Not Q.\n    * Therefore, not P.\n\n3. **Applying Modus Tollens to the argument:**\n    * P: Ben ate pasta\n    * Q: Kate ate salad\n    * Not Q: Kate did not eat salad\n    * Not P: Ben did not eat pasta\n\n4. **Conclusion:** The argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens, a valid argument form.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
