It means that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins *must* be blueberry. \n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The muffins were not blueberry.\" This directly contradicts the consequence of the conditional statement in premise 1.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"The cake was not chocolate.\" This conclusion follows logically from the premises. If the muffins were not blueberry, then the condition for the cake being chocolate (that the muffins are blueberry) is not met. Therefore, the cake cannot be chocolate.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
