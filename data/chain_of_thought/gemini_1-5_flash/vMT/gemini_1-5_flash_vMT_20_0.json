            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the argument's form:** The argument uses a conditional statement (\"If...then...\") in the first premise. This type of argument is called *modus tollens*.\n\n2. **Modus Tollens Structure:** Modus tollens follows this structure:\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * Not Q.\n    * Therefore, not P.\n\n3. **Applying the structure to our argument:**\n    * P: The apple was red.\n    * Q: The banana was yellow.\n    * Not Q: The banana was not yellow.\n    * Not P: The apple was not red.\n\n4. **Validity:** Modus tollens is a logically valid argument form. If the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
