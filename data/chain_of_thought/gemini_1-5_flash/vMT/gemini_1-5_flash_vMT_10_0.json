It means that if the dog is inside, the cat *must* be outside. \n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The cat was not outside.\" This directly contradicts the consequence of the conditional statement in premise 1.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"The dog was not inside.\" This conclusion follows logically from the premises. If the cat wasn't outside, then the condition for the dog being inside (the cat being outside) is not met. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
