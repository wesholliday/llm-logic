It means that if the vampire is awake, the mummy *must* also be awake. \n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The mummy was not awake.\" This tells us the mummy's state.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"The vampire was not awake.\"  This is what we're trying to determine if the argument logically supports.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* **Modus Tollens:** The argument follows the structure of a valid argument form called Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens states:\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * Not Q.\n    * Therefore, not P.\n\n* **Applying Modus Tollens:**\n    * Our P is \"The vampire was awake.\"\n    * Our Q is \"The mummy was awake.\"\n    * Since the mummy was not awake (not Q), we can conclude that the vampire was not awake (not P).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
