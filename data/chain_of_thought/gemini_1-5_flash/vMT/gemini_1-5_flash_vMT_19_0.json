Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n3. **Applying Modus Tollens:** In our case, P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball\". The argument follows the modus tollens structure exactly.\n4. **Validity:** Modus tollens is a logically valid argument form. This means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
