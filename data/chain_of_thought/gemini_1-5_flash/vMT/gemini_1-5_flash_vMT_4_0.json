It means that if the first part (the alien visiting Mars) is true, then the second part (the robot visiting Jupiter) must also be true.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The robot did not visit Jupiter.\" This directly contradicts the second part of the conditional statement in premise 1.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"The alien did not visit Mars.\" This conclusion follows logically from the premises. Since the robot did not visit Jupiter, and the conditional statement in premise 1 tells us that if the alien visited Mars, the robot *must* have visited Jupiter, then the alien cannot have visited Mars.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
