            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the argument:** The argument is a classic example of a logical structure called *modus tollens*. \n2. **Modus Tollens:** Modus tollens states: If P then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n3. **Applying Modus Tollens:** In our case:\n    * P: Lisa bought the red shirt\n    * Q: Mark bought the blue shirt\n    * Not Q: Mark did not buy the blue shirt\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the argument follows the structure of modus tollens, and modus tollens is a valid logical form, the conclusion \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" is logically valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
