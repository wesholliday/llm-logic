It states:\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * Not Q.\n    * Therefore, not P.\n3. **Applying Modus Tollens to the argument:**\n    * P: Sam took a plane.\n    * Q: Erin took a train.\n    * The first premise states \"If P, then Q\".\n    * The second premise states \"Not Q\".\n    * The conclusion states \"Not P\".\n4. **Validity:** Since the argument follows the structure of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
