Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n3. **Applying Modus Tollens:** In our case:\n    * P: Sue chose pizza\n    * Q: Bob chose pasta\n    * Not Q: Bob did not choose pasta\n    * Not P: Sue did not choose pizza\n4. **Validity:** Modus tollens is a logically valid argument form. This means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
