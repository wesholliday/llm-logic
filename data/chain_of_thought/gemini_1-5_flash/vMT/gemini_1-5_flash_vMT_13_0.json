This structure is:\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * Not Q.\n    * Therefore, not P.\n\n2. **Applying the structure to the argument:**\n    * P: The car was red.\n    * Q: The truck was blue.\n    * Not Q: The truck was not blue.\n    * Not P: The car was not red.\n\n3. **Evaluating validity:** Modus tollens is a logically valid argument form. This means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
