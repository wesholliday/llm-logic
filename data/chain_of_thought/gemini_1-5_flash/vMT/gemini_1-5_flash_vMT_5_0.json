            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the argument:** The argument is a classic example of a logical structure called *modus tollens*. \n2. **Modus Tollens:** Modus tollens states: If P then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n3. **Applying Modus Tollens:** In our case:\n    * P: Jeff played basketball\n    * Q: Amy played tennis\n4. **Analyzing the premises:**\n    * The first premise states \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This aligns with the \"If P then Q\" structure of modus tollens.\n    * The second premise states \"Amy did not play tennis.\" This aligns with the \"Not Q\" structure of modus tollens.\n5. **Conclusion:** The conclusion, \"Jeff did not play basketball,\" follows logically from the premises based on the modus tollens structure.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
