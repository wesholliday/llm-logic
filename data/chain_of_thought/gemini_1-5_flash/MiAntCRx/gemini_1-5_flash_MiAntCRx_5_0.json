However, it doesn't tell us anything about whether the flimble might also be wobble. It's possible that the flimble can only be grooble, or that it can be both grooble and wobble, or that it can be neither. We cannot infer from the given statement that the flimble might be both wobble and grooble.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
