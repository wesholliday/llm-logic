The statement \"The plonk might flimble and fizzle\" tells us that there is a possibility of the plonk both flimbleing and fizzing.  We don't know what \"flimble\" means, so we can't infer that it will happen.  Even if \"flimble\" is something that can happen, the original statement doesn't tell us anything about it. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
