The statement \"The floob must be zibble by glorp or wozzle flimble\" includes the original necessary condition, but also adds another possibility. Since the original statement only requires the floob to be zibble by glorp, the second statement is still true even if the floob is not wozzle flimble. Therefore, the second statement can be inferred from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
