The statement \"The snizzle must be grooble with zooble or flimble fizzle\" includes the original necessary condition, but also adds another possibility. Since the original statement only requires the snizzle to be grooble with zooble, it does not necessarily imply the added possibility of flimble fizzle. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
