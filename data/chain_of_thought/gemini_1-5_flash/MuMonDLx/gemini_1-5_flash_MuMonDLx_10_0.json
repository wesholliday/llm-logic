The statement \"The frazzle must be froodle or wobble\" allows for the possibility that the frazzle is either froodle or wobble. Since the first statement is more specific and doesn't allow for the possibility of the frazzle being wobble, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
