The statement \"The plonk must quazzle at grazzle plimp or be frazzle\" expands on this by adding an alternative outcome: if the plonk doesn't quazzle at grazzle plimp, it must be frazzle.  Since the second statement includes the original requirement and adds an additional condition, it can be inferred from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
