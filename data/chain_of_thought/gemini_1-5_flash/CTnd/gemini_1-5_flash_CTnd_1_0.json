It means that if the first part (it's raining) is true, then the second part (it's not raining hard) must also be true.\n\n2. **The inferred statement:** \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining.\" This is also a conditional statement.\n\n3. **Analyzing the relationship:** The original statement doesn't tell us anything about what happens if it's raining hard. It only tells us what happens if it's raining (in general). \n\n4. **The key point:**  It's possible for it to be raining hard and still be raining. The original statement doesn't rule out this possibility.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
