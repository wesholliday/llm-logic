It means that if the first part is true (the room was cleaned), then the second part must also be true (it was not cleaned thoroughly).\n\n2. **The question:** Can we infer \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\"? This is also a conditional statement.\n\n3. **Analyzing the relationship:** The original statement tells us that cleaning implies not cleaning thoroughly.  The question asks if cleaning thoroughly implies not cleaning. These are opposite scenarios.\n\n4. **Reasoning:**  The original statement doesn't provide any information about what happens if the room is cleaned thoroughly. It only tells us what happens if it's cleaned (without specifying thoroughness). Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the scenario where the room is cleaned thoroughly.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
