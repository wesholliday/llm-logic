This is asking if we can reverse the conditional statement.\n4. **Reasoning:**  Reversing a conditional statement doesn't always lead to a valid conclusion.  The original statement doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the issue *was* discussed in depth. It only tells us what happens if it was discussed (without specifying depth).\n5. **Example:** Imagine a scenario where an issue is discussed briefly, but not in depth. This fits the original statement. However, it doesn't mean that if the issue was discussed in depth, it couldn't have also been discussed briefly.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
