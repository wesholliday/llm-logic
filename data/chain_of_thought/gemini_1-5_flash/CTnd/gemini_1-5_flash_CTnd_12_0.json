The contrapositive is formed by negating both the antecedent and consequent and switching their positions.\n   - **Contrapositive:** If Jane studied long, then she did not study.\n\n4. **Determine if the contrapositive is the same as the inference:** The inference we are asked to consider is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
