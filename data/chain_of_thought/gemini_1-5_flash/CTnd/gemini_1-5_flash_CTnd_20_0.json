The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the statement \"If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
