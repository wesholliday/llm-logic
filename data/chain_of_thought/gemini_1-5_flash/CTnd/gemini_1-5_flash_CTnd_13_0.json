It means that if the first part (Alex exercised) is true, then the second part (he did not exercise much) must also be true.\n\n2. **The question:** \"Can we infer 'If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise'?\" This is asking if we can reverse the original statement and still have a valid conclusion.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  The original statement implies that exercising and exercising much are mutually exclusive. If Alex exercised, he couldn't have exercised much. However, the reversed statement implies that exercising much and exercising are also mutually exclusive. This is not necessarily true. Alex could have exercised a moderate amount, which would satisfy neither the original statement nor the reversed statement.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
