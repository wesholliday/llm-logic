It's in the form \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  The original statement tells us that if the meal was prepared, it was *not* prepared carefully. This doesn't automatically mean that if the meal was prepared carefully, it wasn't prepared at all. It's possible the meal could have been prepared both carefully and in some way.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
