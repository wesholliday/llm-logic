The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".  In our case, the contrapositive would be \"If Ben studied diligently, then he studied.\"\n\n3. **Analyze the desired inference:** The desired inference is \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study.\" This is the converse of the original statement. The converse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If Q, then P\".\n\n4. **Determine the relationship between the converse and the original statement:**  The converse of a conditional statement is *not* logically equivalent to the original statement.  \n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since the desired inference is the converse of the original statement, and converses are not logically equivalent, we cannot infer the desired statement from the original statement.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
