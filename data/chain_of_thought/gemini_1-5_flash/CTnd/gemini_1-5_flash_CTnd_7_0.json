If someone was served, they couldn't have been served promptly. However, this doesn't automatically mean the reverse is true. Just because someone was served promptly doesn't necessarily mean they weren't served at all.\n\n4. **Example:** Imagine a restaurant where service is always prompt.  A customer could be served promptly and still be served.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
