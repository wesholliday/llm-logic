The converse of the original statement would be \"If directions were not explained clearly, then they were provided.\"\n\n3. **Contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion and switching their order. The contrapositive of the original statement would be \"If directions were explained clearly, then they were not provided.\"\n\n4. **Equivalence:** A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they have the same truth value.\n\n5. **Inference:** Since the contrapositive of the original statement is \"If directions were explained clearly, then they were not provided\", and the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
