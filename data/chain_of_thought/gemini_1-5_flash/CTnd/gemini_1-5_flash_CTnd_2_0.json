This doesn't necessarily mean that if she exercised strenuously, she couldn't have exercised at all. It's possible she could have exercised in a non-strenuous way.\n\n4. **Example:** Imagine Ann went for a walk (exercise) but not a run (strenuous exercise). The original statement holds true. However, if she went for a run (strenuous exercise), she still exercised.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
