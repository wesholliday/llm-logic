This statement implies that if an issue was addressed effectively, it was not addressed at all.\n\n3. **Reasoning:** The original statement tells us that addressing an issue means it was done ineffectively.  The question asks if we can infer that addressing an issue effectively means it wasn't addressed at all. These two statements contradict each other. \n\n4. **Conclusion:** We cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
