It means that if the first part is true (the room was tidied), then the second part must also be true (it was not tidied thoroughly).\n\n2. **The question:** Can we infer \"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied\"? This is also a conditional statement.\n\n3. **Analyzing the relationship:** The original statement tells us that tidying implies not tidying thoroughly.  It doesn't say anything about what happens if the room is tidied thoroughly.  \n\n4. **Reasoning:**  The original statement doesn't provide any information about what happens if the room is tidied thoroughly. It only tells us what happens if the room is tidied (not necessarily thoroughly). Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
