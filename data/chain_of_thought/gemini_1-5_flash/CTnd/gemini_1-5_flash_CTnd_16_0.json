This implies that a completed job *cannot* be done well.\n    * The new statement says that if the job was done well, it was *not* completed. This implies that a well-done job *cannot* be completed.\n\n4. **The two statements contradict each other.** The original statement says a completed job can't be well-done, while the new statement says a well-done job can't be completed. These are incompatible ideas.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
