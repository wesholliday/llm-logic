The statement \"The book might be on the shelf or in the library\" includes the possibility of the book being on the shelf, but also adds the possibility of it being in the library. Since the first statement doesn't rule out the possibility of the book being in the library, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
