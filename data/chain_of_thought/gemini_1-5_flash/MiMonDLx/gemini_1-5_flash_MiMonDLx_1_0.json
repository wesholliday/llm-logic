The statement \"The blurble might be wibble a frozz or plonk\" expands on this possibility by adding another potential state for the blurble. Since the first statement doesn't exclude the possibility of the blurble being plonk, the second statement is a logical extension of the first. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
