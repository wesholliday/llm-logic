The statement \"The zibber might be froodle or on wibble\" expands on this possibility by adding another potential state for the zibber. Since the original statement doesn't exclude the possibility of the zibber being on wibble, the expanded statement is still a valid possibility. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
