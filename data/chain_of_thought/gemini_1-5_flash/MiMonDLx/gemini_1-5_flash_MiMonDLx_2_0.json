The statement \"The blimple might be on the flump or in the wobble\" also includes the possibility of the blimple being on the flump, but it adds another possibility. Since the first statement doesn't exclude the possibility of the blimple being in the wobble, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
