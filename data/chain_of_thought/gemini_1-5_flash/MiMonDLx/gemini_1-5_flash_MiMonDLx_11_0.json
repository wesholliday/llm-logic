The statement \"The snork might be zazzle or quazzle\" also implies a possibility, but it includes the possibility of the snork being quazzle as well. Since the first statement only mentions zazzle, it does not necessarily include the possibility of the snork being quazzle. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
