The statement \"The snork might be plonk or wobble\" also implies the snork has the potential to be plonk, but it adds the possibility of it being wobble. Since the first statement doesn't rule out the possibility of the snork being wobble, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
