It could be somewhere else.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet.\" This means the umbrella has two possible locations: the car or the closet.\n\n3. **Combining the premises:** Since the umbrella doesn't *have* to be in the closet (premise 1), and it can only be in the car or the closet (premise 2), we can conclude that the umbrella *must* be in the car.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
