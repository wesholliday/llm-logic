It could be elsewhere.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\" This presents two possibilities:\n    * **Possibility A:** The watch is charging on the dresser.\n    * **Possibility B:** The watch must be on his wrist.\n\n3. **Combining Premise 1 and Premise 2:**  Premise 1 eliminates Possibility B (the watch must be on his wrist). This leaves only Possibility A.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since Possibility A is the only remaining possibility, we can infer that \"The watch is charging on the dresser.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
