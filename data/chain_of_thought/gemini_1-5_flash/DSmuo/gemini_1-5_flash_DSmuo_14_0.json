It could be elsewhere.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\" This means there are only two possibilities: the milk is on the counter, or it's in the fridge.\n\n3. **Combining the premises:** Since we know the milk doesn't *have* to be in the fridge (premise 1), and the only other possibility is that it's on the counter (premise 2), we can conclude that the milk must be on the counter.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
