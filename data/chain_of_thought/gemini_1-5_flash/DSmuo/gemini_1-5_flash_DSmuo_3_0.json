They could be elsewhere.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\" This presents two possibilities:\n    * **Possibility A:** The keys are in the drawer.\n    * **Possibility B:** The keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\n\n3. **Combining the premises:** Since we know from Premise 1 that the keys *don't* have to be dangling in the cabinet, we can eliminate Possibility B.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** This leaves us with only Possibility A: The keys are in the drawer.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
