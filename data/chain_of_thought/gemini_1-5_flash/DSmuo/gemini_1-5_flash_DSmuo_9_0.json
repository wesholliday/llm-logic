It could be somewhere else.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor.\" This means there are only two possibilities: the piece is in the box, or it's blending in on the floor.\n\n3. **Combining the premises:** Since we know the piece doesn't *have* to be blending in on the floor (from premise 1), and the only other possibility is that it's in the box (from premise 2), we can infer that the piece is in the box.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
