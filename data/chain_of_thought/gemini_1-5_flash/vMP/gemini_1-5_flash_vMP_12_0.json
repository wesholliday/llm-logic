            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the argument's form:** The argument is a classic example of *modus ponens*. This form is:\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * P.\n    * Therefore, Q.\n\n2. **Understand modus ponens:** Modus ponens is a logically valid argument form. This means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n3. **Apply to the given argument:**\n    *  \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" (P implies Q)\n    *  \"Joe went to the park\" (P)\n    *  \"Therefore, Lucy went to the zoo\" (Q)\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the argument follows the valid form of modus ponens, it is logically valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
