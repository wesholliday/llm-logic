This form looks like:\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * P.\n    * Therefore, Q.\n\n2. **Apply the form to the argument:**\n    * P: The vampire was awake.\n    * Q: The mummy was awake.\n\n3. **Determine if the argument is valid:**  Modus ponens is a logically valid argument form. This means that if the premises are true, the conclusion *must* also be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
