            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the argument's form:** The argument is a classic example of *modus ponens*. This form looks like:\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * P.\n    * Therefore, Q.\n\n2. **Analyze the premises:**\n    * **Premise 1:** \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This establishes a conditional relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal.\n    * **Premise 2:** \"The doll was plastic.\" This confirms the antecedent (the 'P' part) of the conditional statement in premise 1.\n\n3. **Apply the modus ponens rule:**  Modus ponens states that if the antecedent of a conditional statement is true, then the consequent (the 'Q' part) must also be true. Since premise 2 confirms the antecedent of premise 1, we can conclude that the consequent (the truck being metal) is true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
