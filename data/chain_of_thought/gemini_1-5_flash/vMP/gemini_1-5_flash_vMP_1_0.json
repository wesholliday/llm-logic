This form looks like:\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * P.\n    * Therefore, Q.\n\n2. **Understand modus ponens:** Modus ponens is a logically valid argument form. This means that if the premises are true, the conclusion *must* also be true.\n\n3. **Apply to the given argument:**\n    *  \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" (P implies Q)\n    *  \"Mary was at the wedding\" (P is true)\n    *  \"Therefore, Sue was at the wedding\" (Q must be true)\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
