            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the argument's form:** The argument is a classic example of *modus ponens*. This form looks like:\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * P.\n    * Therefore, Q.\n\n2. **Analyze the premises and conclusion:**\n    * **Premise 1:** \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This establishes a conditional relationship between the bear's location and the wolf's location.\n    * **Premise 2:** \"The bear was in the cave.\" This confirms the antecedent (the 'P' part) of the conditional statement in premise 1.\n    * **Conclusion:** \"The wolf was in the den.\" This is the consequent (the 'Q' part) of the conditional statement in premise 1.\n\n3. **Determine logical validity:**  *Modus ponens* is a logically valid argument form. If the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
