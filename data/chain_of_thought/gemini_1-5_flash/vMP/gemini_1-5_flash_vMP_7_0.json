This form is:\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * P.\n    * Therefore, Q.\n\n2. **Understand modus ponens:** Modus ponens is a logically valid argument form. This means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n3. **Apply to the given argument:**\n    *  P: Alex finished the race.\n    *  Q: Chris finished the race.\n    *  The argument follows the modus ponens form.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
