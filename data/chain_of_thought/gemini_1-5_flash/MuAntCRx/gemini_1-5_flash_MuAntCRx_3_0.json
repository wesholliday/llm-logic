To infer something means to deduce it from something else.  We can only infer something if it is logically implied by the original statement.  The original statement only tells us that the wobble must frozz fizzle.  It does not tell us anything about fribbling quorple.  Therefore, we cannot infer that the wobble must fribble quorple.  \n\nAnswer: no \n"
