We can only infer something if it is logically implied by the given information.  The second statement includes the first statement, but it also adds the additional condition that \"The zazzle must frozz a quimble.\"  Since we have no information about whether or not the zazzle must frozz a quimble, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
