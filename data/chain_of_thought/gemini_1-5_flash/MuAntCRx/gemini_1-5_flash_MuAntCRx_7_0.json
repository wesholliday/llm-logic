We need to determine if we can infer the statement \"The plonk must blimple quibble frozz and frozz floob gronk\".  To infer something, we need to be able to logically deduce it from the given information.  The second statement includes the phrase \"frozz floob gronk\" which is present in the first statement. However, the second statement also includes the phrase \"blimble quibble frozz\" which is not present in the first statement.  Since we cannot logically deduce the phrase \"blimble quibble frozz\" from the first statement, we cannot infer the second statement.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
