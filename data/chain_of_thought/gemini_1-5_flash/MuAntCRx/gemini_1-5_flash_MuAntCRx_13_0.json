To infer something means to deduce it from something else.  In this case, we are trying to deduce the second statement from the first.  The second statement includes the first statement, but it also includes the additional clause \"quork gribble\".  Since we have no information about \"quork gribble\" from the first statement, we cannot infer it. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
