The second statement, \"The quazzle must be frazzle by flibbit and be flibbit by zizz\" adds an additional condition (being frazzle by flibbit) that wasn't mentioned in the original statement.  Since the original statement only mentions one condition, we cannot infer the additional condition.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
