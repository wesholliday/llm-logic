To infer something, we need to be able to logically deduce it from the given information.  The given statement only tells us that the plonk must be shimble for. It doesn't say anything about the plonk needing to zibber for. Therefore, we cannot infer that the plonk must zibber for. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
