It says that if the sprocket was cranked (antecedent), then it was daggled (consequent).\n* Premise 1 tells us the consequent (daggled) is true.\n* **However, a true consequent does not guarantee a true antecedent.**  Think of it like this:  \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\"  Just because the ground is wet doesn't mean it's raining (it could be wet from something else).\n\n**Therefore, we cannot infer that the sprocket was cranked.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
