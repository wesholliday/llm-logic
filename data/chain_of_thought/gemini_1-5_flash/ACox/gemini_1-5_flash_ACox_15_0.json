It says that if the zinger was fraggled, then it must be smoogled. \n* Premise 1 tells us that the zinger was indeed smoogled. \n* However, the conditional statement doesn't work in reverse. Just because the zinger was smoogled doesn't automatically mean it was fraggled. There could be other reasons why the zinger was smoogled.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
