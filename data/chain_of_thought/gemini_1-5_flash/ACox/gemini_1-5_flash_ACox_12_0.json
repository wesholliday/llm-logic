It means that if the wug was flooped, then it must also be bimmed. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that if the wug was bimmed, it was also flooped.\n3. **Inference:** We are asked if we can infer \"The wug was flooped.\"  \n4. **Reasoning:**  Premise 2 only tells us that flooping *implies* bimming. It doesn't work the other way around.  Just because the wug was bimmed doesn't mean it was necessarily flooped. There could be other reasons why the wug was bimmed.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
