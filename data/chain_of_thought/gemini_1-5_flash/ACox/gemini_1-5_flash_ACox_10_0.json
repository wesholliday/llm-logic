It means that if the wug was sproinged, then it must also be garpled. However, it doesn't tell us whether the wug was actually sproinged.\n3. **Inference:** We are asked if we can infer \"The wug was sproinged.\" \n4. **Reasoning:**  The conditional statement in premise 2 only tells us what happens *if* the wug was sproinged. It doesn't tell us whether the wug was actually sproinged.  The fact that the wug was garpled (premise 1) could be due to something else entirely, not just being sproinged.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
