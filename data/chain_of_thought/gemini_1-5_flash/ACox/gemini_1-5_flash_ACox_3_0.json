It says that if the splat was morphed, then it quanked. \n* Premise 1 tells us that the splat did indeed quank.\n* However, just because the splat quanked doesn't necessarily mean it was morphed. There could be other reasons why it quanked. \n* The conditional statement only tells us what happens *if* the splat was morphed, not what happens if it wasn't.\n\n**Conclusion:** We cannot infer that the splat was morphed.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
