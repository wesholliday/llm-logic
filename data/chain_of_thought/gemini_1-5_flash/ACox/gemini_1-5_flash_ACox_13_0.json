It tells us that if the splat was morphed, then it was definitely quanked. \n* Premise 1 tells us that the splat was quanked. \n* However, just because the splat was quanked doesn't automatically mean it was morphed. There could be other reasons why the splat was quanked. \n* The conditional statement in Premise 2 only works in one direction. It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the splat was *not* morphed.\n\n**Conclusion:** We cannot infer \"The splat was morphed\" from the given premises.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
