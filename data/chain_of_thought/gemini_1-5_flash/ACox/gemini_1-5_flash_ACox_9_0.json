It means that if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that if the twonk was varnished, it was also plinked.\n\n3. **Inference:** We are asked if we can infer \"The twonk was plinked.\"  \n\n4. **Reasoning:**  Premise 2 only tells us what happens *if* the twonk was plinked. It doesn't tell us anything about what happened if the twonk was varnished for another reason.  \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
