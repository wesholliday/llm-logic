It doesn't tell us whether the flugel was actually blimmed, only that if it *was* blimmed, then it would also be zargled.\n3. **Inference:** We are asked if we can infer \"The flugel was blimmed.\" \n4. **Reasoning:**  Premise 2 tells us that being blimmed *implies* being zargled. However, it doesn't work the other way around. Just because the flugel is zargled doesn't automatically mean it was blimmed. There could be other reasons why it's zargled.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
