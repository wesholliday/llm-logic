It says that if the whiffle was shanked, then it was also tinked. \n* Premise 1 tells us that the whiffle was indeed tinked. \n* However, just because the whiffle was tinked, it doesn't necessarily mean it was shanked. There could be other reasons why the whiffle was tinked. \n\n**Example:** Imagine \"shanked\" means \"hit with a hammer\" and \"tinked\" means \"made a noise.\"  The whiffle could have been tinked by being dropped, not just by being hit with a hammer.\n\n**Conclusion:** We cannot infer that the whiffle was shanked.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
