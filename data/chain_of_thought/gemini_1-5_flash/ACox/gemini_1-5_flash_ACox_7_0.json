It says that if the whiffle was shanked, then a certain consequence (tinking) would follow.\n* Premise 1 tells us that the consequence (tinking) did occur.\n* However, the conditional statement doesn't guarantee that the whiffle was shanked. There could be other reasons why the whiffle tinked. \n\n**Example:** Imagine the whiffle tinked because it was dropped, not because it was shanked. The conditional statement would still be true, but the conclusion \"The whiffle was shanked\" would be false.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
