It means that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that if the fribble crinked, it was snurgled. \n3. **Inference:** We are asked if we can infer \"The fribble was snurgled.\"  \n4. **Reasoning:**  Premise 2 only tells us what happens *if* the fribble was snurgled. It doesn't tell us what happened if the fribble crinked for other reasons.  There could be other reasons why the fribble crinked, even if it wasn't snurgled.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
