It means that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must also be crinked. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that if the fribble is crinked, it was snurgled.\n\n3. **Inference:** We are asked if we can infer \"The fribble was snurgled.\"  \n\n4. **Reasoning:**  Premise 2 only tells us that snurgling *implies* crinkling. It doesn't work the other way around.  Just because the fribble is crinked, doesn't mean it was necessarily snurgled. There could be other reasons why it's crinked.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
