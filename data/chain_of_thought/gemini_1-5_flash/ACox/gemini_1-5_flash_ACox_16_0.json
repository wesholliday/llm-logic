It says that if the grommet was sploffed, then it must have been plopped. \n3. **Inference:** We want to know if we can infer \"The grommet was sploffed.\"\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* Premise 2 doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the grommet wasn't sploffed. It only tells us what happens *if* it was sploffed. \n* We know the grommet was plopped (Premise 1), but this could be because it was sploffed or because it was plopped in some other way. \n* The conditional statement doesn't guarantee that the grommet was sploffed, only that if it was, then it was also plopped.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
