It tells us that cranking the sprocket *implies* that it was daggled. \n* Premise 1 tells us that the sprocket was indeed daggled.\n* However, just because the sprocket was daggled doesn't automatically mean it was cranked. There could be other reasons why it was daggled. \n\n**Example:** Imagine the sprocket could be daggled by a different action besides cranking. \n\n**Conclusion:** We cannot infer that the sprocket was cranked.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
