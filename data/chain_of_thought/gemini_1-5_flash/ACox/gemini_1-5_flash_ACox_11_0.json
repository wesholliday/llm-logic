It says that if the flug was blummed, then a certain consequence (being zimmed) follows.\n* Premise 1 tells us that the consequence (being zimmed) is true.\n* However, the conditional statement doesn't guarantee that the antecedent (being blummed) is true. It only says what happens *if* the antecedent is true.\n* There could be other reasons why the flug was zimmed, not just because it was blummed.\n\n**Therefore, we cannot infer \"The flug was blummed\" from the given premises.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
