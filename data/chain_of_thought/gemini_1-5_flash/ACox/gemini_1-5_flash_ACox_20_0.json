It means that if the wug was sproinged, then it must also be garpled. However, it doesn't tell us whether the wug was actually sproinged.\n3. **Inference:** We are asked if we can infer \"The wug was sproinged.\" \n4. **Reasoning:**  While we know the wug was garpled, the conditional statement only tells us what *must* be true if the wug was sproinged. It doesn't tell us whether the wug was actually sproinged. There could be other reasons why the wug was garpled. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
