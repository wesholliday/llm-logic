It says that if the grommet was sploffed, then a certain consequence (plopping the frink) occurred.\n* Premise 1 tells us that the consequence (plopping the frink) did occur.\n* **However, this doesn't automatically mean the condition (being sploffed) was true.**  There could be other reasons why the grommet plopped the frink. \n\n**Example:** Imagine \"sploffed\" means \"being wet\" and \"plopping the frink\" means \"dropping a ball.\"  Just because the grommet dropped a ball doesn't mean it was wet. It could have dropped the ball for other reasons.\n\n**Therefore, we cannot infer \"The grommet was sploffed\" from the given premises.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
