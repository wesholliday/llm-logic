Identify the Form of the Argument:**\n\n* The argument uses the form of a conditional statement (if p, then q) and its contrapositive (if not q, then not p).\n\n**2. Understand the Relationship Between a Conditional Statement and its Contrapositive:**\n\n* A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they have the same truth value. If one is true, the other must also be true.\n\n**3. Apply the Logic to the Argument:**\n\n* **Premise:** If a recommendation was made (p), then it was not a strong recommendation (not q).\n* **Conclusion:** If a strong recommendation was made (q), then a recommendation was not made (not p).\n\n**4. Determine Validity:**\n\n* The conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. Since a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, the argument is valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
