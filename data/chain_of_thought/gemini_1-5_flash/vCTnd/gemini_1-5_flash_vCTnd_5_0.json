If the room was cleaned thoroughly, it was definitely cleaned.\n\n3. **Logical Validity:**  To be logically valid, the conclusion must follow necessarily from the premise. In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premise. The premise states that a cleaning occurred, but it wasn't thorough. The conclusion states that if a thorough cleaning occurred, then no cleaning occurred. These statements are incompatible.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
