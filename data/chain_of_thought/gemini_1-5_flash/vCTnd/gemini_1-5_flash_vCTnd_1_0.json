The premise states that \"raining\" implies \"not raining hard\".  The conclusion tries to flip this around, saying that \"raining hard\" implies \"not raining\".\n\n**The problem:**\n\nThe premise and conclusion are not logically equivalent.  Just because something is true in one direction doesn't mean it's true in the opposite direction.  For example, \"If you are a dog, then you are an animal\" is true, but \"If you are an animal, then you are a dog\" is not.\n\n**Therefore:**\n\nThe argument is not logically valid.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
