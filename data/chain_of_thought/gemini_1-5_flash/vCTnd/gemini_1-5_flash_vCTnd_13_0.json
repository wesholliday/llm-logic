            "content": "Here's how we can break down the argument:\n\n1. **Premise:** \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much.\"  This can be represented symbolically as:  \n   *  E \u2192 \u00acM  (where E = Alex exercised, M = Alex exercised much)\n\n2. **Conclusion:** \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise.\" This can be represented symbolically as:\n   * M \u2192 \u00acE\n\n3. **Logical Validity:**  An argument is logically valid if the conclusion *must* be true whenever the premises are true.  To determine this, we can use a truth table:\n\n   | E | M | \u00acE | \u00acM | E \u2192 \u00acM | M \u2192 \u00acE |\n   |---|---|---|---|---|---|\n   | T | T | F | F | F | F |\n   | T | F | F | T | T | T |\n   | F | T | T | F | T | T |\n   | F | F | T | T | T | T |\n\n4. **Analysis:**  Notice that in the first row, the premise (E \u2192 \u00acM) is false, but the conclusion (M \u2192 \u00acE) is also false.  This means the conclusion does not *necessarily* follow from the premise.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
