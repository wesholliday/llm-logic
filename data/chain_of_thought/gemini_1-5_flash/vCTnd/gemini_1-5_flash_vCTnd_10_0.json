Understanding the Argument's Structure**\n\n* **Premise:** \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice.\" This is a conditional statement.\n* **Conclusion:** \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered.\" This is also a conditional statement.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Relationship Between Premise and Conclusion**\n\nThe conclusion seems to be a kind of \"contrapositive\" of the premise.  The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and switching their positions.\n\n**3. Applying the Contrapositive Rule**\n\nThe contrapositive rule states that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.  This means if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n**4. Checking for Equivalence**\n\n* **Premise:** If P, then Q (where P = advice offered, Q = not helpful advice)\n* **Conclusion:** If not Q, then not P (where not Q = helpful advice, not P = advice not offered)\n\nThe conclusion is indeed the contrapositive of the premise.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
