In other words, is the conclusion a logical consequence of the premise?\n\n4. **Contrapositive:** The premise (P \u2192 \u00acQ) has a logically equivalent contrapositive (\u00ac\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP), which simplifies to (Q \u2192 \u00acP).  This is exactly the same as the conclusion!\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and contrapositives are logically equivalent, the argument is logically valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
