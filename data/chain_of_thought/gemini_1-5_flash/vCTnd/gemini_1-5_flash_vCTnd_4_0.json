Identify the Form of the Argument:**\n\n* The argument uses a conditional statement (if-then) in both the premise and the conclusion. This suggests it might be a form of logical implication.\n\n**2. Analyze the Premise:**\n\n* The premise is \"If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently.\" This statement is logically possible. It could be true if Ben studied casually or superficially.\n\n**3. Analyze the Conclusion:**\n\n* The conclusion is \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study.\" This statement seems contradictory. If Ben studied diligently, he must have studied.\n\n**4. Determine Validity:**\n\n* A valid argument is one where the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, the conclusion contradicts the premise. If the premise is true, the conclusion cannot be true. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
