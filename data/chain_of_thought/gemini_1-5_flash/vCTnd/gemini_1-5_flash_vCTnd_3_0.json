Just because a conditional statement is true, doesn't mean its converse is also true.\n3. **Apply the reasoning to the argument:** The premise states \"If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal.\" This could be true. For example, I might have eaten a small snack. However, the conclusion \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal\" is clearly false. You cannot eat a large meal without eating a meal. \n4. **Conclusion:** Since the conclusion can be false even when the premise is true, the argument is not logically valid.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
