            "content": "Here's how we can break down the argument:\n\n1. **Premise:** \"If Ann exercised, then she did not exercise strenuously.\"  This can be represented symbolically as:  \n   *  E \u2192 \u00acS  (where E = Ann exercised, S = Ann exercised strenuously, \u00ac = not)\n\n2. **Conclusion:** \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise.\" This can be represented as:\n   * S \u2192 \u00acE\n\n3. **Logical Validity:**  An argument is logically valid if the conclusion *must* be true whenever the premises are true.  To test this, we can use a truth table:\n\n   | E | S | \u00acE | \u00acS | E \u2192 \u00acS | S \u2192 \u00acE |\n   |---|---|---|---|---|---|\n   | T | T | F | F | F | F |\n   | T | F | F | T | T | T |\n   | F | T | T | F | T | T |\n   | F | F | T | T | T | T |\n\n4. **Analysis:**  Notice that in the first row, the premise (E \u2192 \u00acS) is false, but the conclusion (S \u2192 \u00acE) is also false. This means the conclusion does not *have* to be true when the premise is true.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
