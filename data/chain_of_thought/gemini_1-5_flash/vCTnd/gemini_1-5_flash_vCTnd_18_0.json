Identify the Argument's Structure:**\n\n* **Premise:** If P, then Q (where P = \"the issue was discussed\" and Q = \"it was not discussed in depth\")\n* **Conclusion:** If R, then S (where R = \"the issue was discussed in depth\" and S = \"it was not discussed\")\n\n**2. Analyze the Relationship Between Premise and Conclusion:**\n\nThe premise states that if something is discussed, it's not discussed in depth. The conclusion states that if something is discussed in depth, it wasn't discussed at all. These statements seem to contradict each other.\n\n**3. Apply Logical Reasoning:**\n\nTo determine validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.  If the premise is true, does it necessarily mean the conclusion must also be true?\n\n* **Consider a scenario where the premise is true:**  Let's say the issue was discussed briefly (not in depth). This fits the premise. However, it doesn't necessarily mean the issue wasn't discussed at all.  The conclusion is not guaranteed to be true in this scenario.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\n\nSince the conclusion doesn't logically follow from the premise, the argument is not valid.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
