The conclusion is \"If Q is false, then P is false\".\n3. **Apply the contrapositive rule:** The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If Q is false, then P is false\". This rule states that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.\n4. **Determine validity:** Since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
