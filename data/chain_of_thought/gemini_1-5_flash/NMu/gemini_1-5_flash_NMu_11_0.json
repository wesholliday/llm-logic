It could be there, but it's not a certainty.\n\n2. **The potential inference:** \"The newspaper might not be in the driveway.\" This statement acknowledges the possibility that the newspaper is *not* in the driveway.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  If the newspaper doesn't *have* to be in the driveway, it's entirely possible that it's *not* there.
