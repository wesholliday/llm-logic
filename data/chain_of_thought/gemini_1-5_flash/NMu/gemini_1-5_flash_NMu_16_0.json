There's a possibility it's somewhere else.\n\n2. **The inference:** \"The pen might not be in my bag.\" This statement acknowledges the possibility that the pen is not in the bag.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  If the pen doesn't *have* to be in the bag, it *could* be elsewhere. This aligns with the inference that the pen might not be in the bag.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
