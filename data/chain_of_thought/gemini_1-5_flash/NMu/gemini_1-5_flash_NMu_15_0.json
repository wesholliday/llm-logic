There could be other possibilities.\n\n2. **Possible scenarios:**  \n    * The shoes could be in the closet.\n    * The shoes could be somewhere else (e.g., under the bed, in the hallway).\n\n3. **Inference:** Since the shoes don't *have* to be in the closet, it's possible they are not in the closet. This aligns with the meaning of \"The shoes might not be in the closet.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
