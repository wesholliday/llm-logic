It doesn't say anything about what happens if the splat wasn't morphed.\n\n2. **The proposed inference:** \"If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n3. **Contrapositives and logic:** In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\n4. **Applying the logic:** Since the original statement doesn't tell us what happens if the splat wasn't morphed, we can't infer anything about that scenario. The contrapositive is not necessarily true.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
