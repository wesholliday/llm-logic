It means that if the fleeg is bluttered, then it *must* surn. \n\n2. **Contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" is \"If the fleeg did not surn, then it was not bluttered.\"\n\n3. **Inverse:** The inverse of a conditional statement is *not* logically equivalent to the original statement. The inverse of \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" is \"If the fleeg was not bluttered, then it did not surn.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement, we cannot infer it from the original statement.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
