It means that if the first part (the smip was shripped) is true, then the second part (the smip lupped the zoint) must also be true.\n\n2. **The question:** Can we infer \"If the smip was not shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint\"? This is asking if the original statement implies its **contrapositive**.\n\n3. **Contrapositives:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both parts of the statement and switching their order.  The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\".\n\n4. **Logical Equivalence:** A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they always have the same truth value. If one is true, the other must also be true.\n\n5. **Applying to our case:**  The contrapositive of the original statement is indeed \"If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped.\" Since the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can infer the contrapositive.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
