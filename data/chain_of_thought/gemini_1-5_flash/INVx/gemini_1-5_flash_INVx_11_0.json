It means that if the flug is blummed, it *must* also be zimmed. \n\n2. **Contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then switching their order. The contrapositive of the original statement is \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\"\n\n3. **Equivalence:** A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they have the same truth value. If one is true, the other must also be true.\n\n4. **The question:** The question asks if we can infer \"If the flug was not blummed, then the flug was not zimmed.\" This statement is the converse of the original statement.\n\n5. **Converse vs. Contrapositive:** The converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily equivalent to the original statement. It's possible for the original statement to be true while the converse is false.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
