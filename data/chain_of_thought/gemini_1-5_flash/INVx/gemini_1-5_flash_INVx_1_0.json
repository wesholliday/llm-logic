It means that if the flugel is blimmed, it *must* also be zargled. \n\n2. **Contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then switching their order. The contrapositive of the original statement is \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\n3. **Equivalence:** A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they have the same truth value. If one is true, the other must also be true.\n\n4. **The question:** The question asks if we can infer \"If the flugel was not blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled.\" This statement is the converse of the original statement.\n\n5. **Converse vs. Contrapositive:** The converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily equivalent to the original statement.  \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
