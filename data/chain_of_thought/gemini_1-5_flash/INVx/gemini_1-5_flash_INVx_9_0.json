This is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n4. **Contrapositives:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means they have the same truth value.\n5. **Reasoning:**  The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".  Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer it.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
