            "content": "Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **The original statement:** \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\" This is a conditional statement. It means that if the first part (the whiffle was shanked) is true, then the second part (the whiffle tinked) must also be true.\n\n2. **The question:** Can we infer \"If the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink\"? This is asking if the original statement implies its **contrapositive**.\n\n3. **Contrapositives:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both parts of the statement and switching their order.  The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n4. **Logical Equivalence:** A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they always have the same truth value. If one is true, the other must also be true.\n\n5. **Applying to our example:** The contrapositive of \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\" is \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\".  Since the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can infer the contrapositive.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
