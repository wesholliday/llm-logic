It means that if the first part (the clug was fleeked) is true, then the second part (the clug snugged) must also be true.\n\n2. **The question:** Can we infer \"If the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged\"? This is asking if the original statement implies its **contrapositive**.\n\n3. **Contrapositives:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both parts of the statement and switching their order.  \n\n4. **Reasoning:**  The original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they always have the same truth value. If one is true, the other must also be true.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**  Therefore, we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
