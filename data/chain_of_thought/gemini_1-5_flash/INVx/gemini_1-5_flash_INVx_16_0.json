            "content": "Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the statement:** The original statement is \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\" This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q.\"\n\n2. **Consider the contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then switching their order. The contrapositive of our original statement is \"If the sneg did not sprot the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\"\n\n3. **Equivalence of conditional and contrapositive:** A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they have the same truth value. If one is true, the other is also true.\n\n4. **The question:** The question asks if we can infer \"If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink.\" This statement is the converse of the original statement.\n\n5. **Converse vs. contrapositive:** The converse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. It's possible for the original statement to be true while the converse is false.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
