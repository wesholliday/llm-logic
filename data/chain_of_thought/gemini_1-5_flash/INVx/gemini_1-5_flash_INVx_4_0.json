It doesn't say anything about what happens if the fribble wasn't snurgled.\n\n2. **The inferred statement:** \"If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n3. **Contrapositives and logic:** In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\n4. **Applying the logic:** Since the original statement doesn't tell us what happens if the fribble wasn't snurgled, we can't infer anything about that scenario. The contrapositive is not necessarily true.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
