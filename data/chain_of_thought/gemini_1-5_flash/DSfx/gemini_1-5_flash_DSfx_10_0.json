It's an exclusive \"or,\" meaning it can't be both.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The wug is not garpled.\" This directly contradicts the possibility of the wug being garpled.\n\n3. **Inference:** Since the wug cannot be garpled, and it must be in one of the two states, the only remaining possibility is that the wug is sproinged.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
