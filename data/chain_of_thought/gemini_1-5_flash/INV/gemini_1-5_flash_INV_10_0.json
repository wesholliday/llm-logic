The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". \n4. **Applying the contrapositive:** The contrapositive of our original statement is \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside.\"\n5. **The question:** The question asks if we can infer \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.\" This is the converse of the original statement.\n6. **Converse vs. Contrapositive:** The converse and contrapositive are not logically equivalent.  A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, but a statement and its converse are not.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
