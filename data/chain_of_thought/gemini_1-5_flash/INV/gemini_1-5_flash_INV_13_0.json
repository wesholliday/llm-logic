            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the original statement:** The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement. It means that if the car is red, the truck *must* be blue. However, it doesn't say anything about what happens if the car is *not* red.\n\n2. **Analyzing the inference:** The inference \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\" is also a conditional statement. It claims that if the car is not red, the truck *must* not be blue.\n\n3. **Identifying the flaw:** The original statement only establishes a connection between a red car and a blue truck. It doesn't rule out the possibility of a blue truck existing when the car is not red. For example, the truck could be blue even if the car is green.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** The inference is not logically valid. We cannot infer that the truck is not blue just because the car is not red.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
