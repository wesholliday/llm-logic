            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Original statement:** \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This is a conditional statement. \n2. **Understanding conditionals:**  A conditional statement (\"If P, then Q\") is only false if the first part (P) is true and the second part (Q) is false. \n3. **Contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both parts and switching their order. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" \n4. **Applying the contrapositive:** The contrapositive of our original statement is \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\" \n5. **Inference:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means they have the same truth value. \n6. **The question:** The question asks if we can infer \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\" This is the converse of the original statement. \n7. **Converse vs. Contrapositive:** The converse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. It can be true or false, even if the original statement is true.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
