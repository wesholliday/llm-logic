            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Original statement:** \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement. \n2. **Understanding conditionals:**  A conditional statement (\"If P, then Q\") is only false if the first part (P) is true and the second part (Q) is false. \n3. **Contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both parts and switching their order. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"  It's important to note that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. \n4. **Applying the contrapositive:** The contrapositive of our original statement is \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"\n5. **The question:** The question asks if we can infer \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\" This is the converse of the original statement.\n6. **Converse vs. Contrapositive:** The converse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement.  It's possible for the original statement to be true while the converse is false.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
