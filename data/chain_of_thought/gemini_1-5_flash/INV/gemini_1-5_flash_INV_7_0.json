It means that if Alex finished, Chris *must* have also finished. \n\n2. **The question:** \"Can we infer 'If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race'?\" This is asking if the original statement implies the opposite scenario.\n\n3. **Reasoning:** The original statement doesn't tell us anything about what happens if Alex *didn't* finish. It only establishes a connection if Alex *did* finish.  It's possible that Chris could have finished the race even if Alex didn't. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
