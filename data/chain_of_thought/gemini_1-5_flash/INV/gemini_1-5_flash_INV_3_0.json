The converse of our original statement would be \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James.\"  \n\n4. **The Converse is Not Equivalent:** The converse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement.  Just because the original statement is true doesn't mean the converse is also true.\n\n5. **Example:** Imagine a scenario where a book is a mystery novel, but it was written by someone other than James. This would make the original statement true (since it doesn't say *only* James writes mystery novels), but the converse false.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
