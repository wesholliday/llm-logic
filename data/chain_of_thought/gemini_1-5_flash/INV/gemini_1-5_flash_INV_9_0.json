            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Original statement:** \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement. \n2. **Understanding conditionals:**  A conditional statement (\"If P, then Q\") is only false if the first part (P) is true and the second part (Q) is false. \n3. **Contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both parts and switching their order. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" \n4. **Applying the contrapositive:** The contrapositive of our original statement is \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" \n5. **Equivalence:** The original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they have the same truth value. \n6. **The question:** The question asks if we can infer \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" This is the converse of the original statement. \n7. **Converse vs. Contrapositive:** The converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily equivalent to the original statement. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
