It means that if Mary's presence is true, then Sue's presence is also true.\n\n2. **The inferred statement:** \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n3. **Contrapositives and logic:** In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they have the same truth value. If the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\n4. **Applying this to the scenario:** Since the original statement is a valid conditional statement, its contrapositive is also a valid inference.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
