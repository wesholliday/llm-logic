The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". \n4. **Applying the contrapositive:** The contrapositive of our original statement is \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\"\n5. **Equivalence:** A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they have the same truth value. \n6. **Inference:** Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer it from the original statement.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
