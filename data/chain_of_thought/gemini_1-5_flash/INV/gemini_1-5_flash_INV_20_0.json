It means that if the apple is red, then the banana *must* be yellow. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the apple is *not* red.\n\n2. **Analyzing the inference:** The inference \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\" is also a conditional statement. It claims that if the apple is not red, then the banana *must* not be yellow.\n\n3. **Identifying the flaw:** The original statement only establishes a connection between a red apple and a yellow banana. It doesn't rule out the possibility of a non-red apple being paired with a yellow banana. \n\n4. **Example:** Imagine a scenario where there are green apples and yellow bananas. The original statement would still be true (if the apple is red, the banana is yellow), but the inference would be false (a green apple could still be paired with a yellow banana).\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
