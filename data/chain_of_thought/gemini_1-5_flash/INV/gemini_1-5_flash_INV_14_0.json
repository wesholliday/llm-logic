So, the contrapositive of \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" is \"If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\"\n4. **The question:** The question asks if we can infer \"If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\" This is the converse of the original statement.\n5. **Converse vs. Contrapositive:** The converse and contrapositive are not logically equivalent. The converse can be true or false, even if the original statement is true. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
