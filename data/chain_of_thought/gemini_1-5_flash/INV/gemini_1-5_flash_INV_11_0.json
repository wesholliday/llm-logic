The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n4. **Apply the contrapositive to our statement:** The contrapositive of \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\"\n5. **Compare the contrapositive to the desired inference:** The desired inference is \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\" This is the converse of the original statement, not the contrapositive.\n6. **Understand the relationship between converses and contrapositives:**  A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they have the same truth value. However, a conditional statement and its converse are not logically equivalent. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
