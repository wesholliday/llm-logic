            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the original statement:** \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This is a conditional statement.\n2. **Understand the structure of a conditional statement:** A conditional statement has the form \"If P, then Q.\"  P is the antecedent (the condition) and Q is the consequent (the result).\n3. **Consider the contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the antecedent and the consequent and switching their order. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n4. **Apply the contrapositive to our statement:** The contrapositive of \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n5. **Compare the contrapositive to the desired inference:** The desired inference is \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\" This is the converse of the original statement, not the contrapositive.\n6. **Understand the relationship between converses and contrapositives:**  A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they have the same truth value. However, a conditional statement and its converse are not logically equivalent. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
