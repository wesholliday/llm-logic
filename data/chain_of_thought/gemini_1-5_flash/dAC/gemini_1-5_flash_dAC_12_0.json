However, it doesn't necessarily mean that if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe *must* have gone to the park. \n2. **We are given that \"Lucy went to the zoo\".** This confirms the consequent of the conditional statement.\n3. **The fact that the consequent is true doesn't automatically make the antecedent (Joe going to the park) true.**  Lucy could have gone to the zoo for other reasons.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
