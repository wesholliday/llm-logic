It doesn't say anything about what happens if the car is *not* red.\n\n3. **Apply the information:**\n   - We know the truck was blue (Statement 2). This aligns with the conditional statement, but it doesn't *prove* the car was red. \n\n4. **Consider alternative scenarios:**\n   - The truck could be blue for other reasons besides the car being red.  The car could be any other color, and the truck could still be blue.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
