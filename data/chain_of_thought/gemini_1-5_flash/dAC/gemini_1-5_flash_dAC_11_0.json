This is known as **modus ponens**.\n\n2. **Modus Ponens:** Modus ponens is a valid argument form. It states that if the antecedent (P) is true, and the conditional statement (\"If P, then Q\") is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\n3. **Apply Modus Ponens to the argument:**\n    * P: The cake was chocolate.\n    * Q: The muffins were blueberry.\n    * We are given that \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" (P implies Q) is true.\n    * We are also given that \"The muffins were blueberry\" (Q) is true.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since we have both the conditional statement (P implies Q) and the consequent (Q) being true, we can conclude that the antecedent (P) must also be true. Therefore, we can deduce that \"The cake was chocolate\".\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
