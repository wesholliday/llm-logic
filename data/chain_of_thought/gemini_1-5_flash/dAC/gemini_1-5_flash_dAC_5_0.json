It only states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. \n   - Premise 2 tells us that Amy played tennis, but it doesn't tell us anything about Jeff's actions.\n\n4. **Consider a counterexample:**\n   - It's possible that Amy played tennis for reasons unrelated to Jeff playing basketball. Maybe she played with someone else.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - We cannot deduce that Jeff played basketball based on the given premises.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
