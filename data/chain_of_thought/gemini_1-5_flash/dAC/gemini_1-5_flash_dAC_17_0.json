It says that if the first part (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the second part (Kate ate salad) must also be true.\n\n3. **Apply the logic:**  Statement 2 tells us that the second part of the conditional statement (Kate ate salad) is true. However, this doesn't automatically mean the first part (Ben ate pasta) is also true. \n\n4. **Consider a counterexample:**  Ben could have skipped pasta and Kate could have eaten salad for some other reason. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
