It doesn't say the griffin *was* in the forest, only that *if* it was, then the unicorn was also there.\n\n2. **The second statement:** \"The unicorn was in the forest.\" This tells us the consequence of the conditional statement is true.\n\n3. **Deduction:**  We can't directly deduce that the griffin was in the forest. The conditional statement only works one way.  Just because the unicorn was in the forest doesn't automatically mean the griffin was there. There could be other reasons the unicorn was in the forest.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
