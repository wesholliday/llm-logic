This is known as **modus ponens**.\n\n2. **Modus Ponens:** Modus ponens is a valid argument form. It states that if the antecedent (P) is true, and the conditional statement (\"If P, then Q\") is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\n3. **Apply Modus Ponens to the argument:**\n    *  P: The apple was red.\n    *  Q: The banana was yellow.\n    *  \"If P, then Q\": If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n    *  We are given that Q is true (the banana was yellow).\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since we know Q is true and the conditional statement is true, we cannot conclude that P is true (the apple was red).  Modus ponens only allows us to deduce the consequent (Q) from the antecedent (P) and the conditional statement. It does not work in reverse.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
