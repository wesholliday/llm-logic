This means Fido must be in one of those two places.\n2. **Premise 2:** Fido is not in the garden. This eliminates the possibility of Fido being in the garden.\n3. **Conclusion:** Since Fido cannot be in the garden, and he must be in one of the two places, the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
