It could be ringing elsewhere, or not ringing at all.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"Either the phone must be ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room.\" This means one of two things must be true:\n    * The phone is ringing in the kitchen.\n    * The phone is in the living room.\n\n3. **Combining the premises:** Since we know the phone is *not* necessarily ringing in the kitchen (from premise 1), the only remaining possibility from premise 2 is that the phone is in the living room.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
