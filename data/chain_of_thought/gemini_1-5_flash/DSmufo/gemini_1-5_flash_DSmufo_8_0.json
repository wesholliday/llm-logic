It could be elsewhere.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table.\" This presents two possibilities:\n    * The remote control is under the couch.\n    * The remote control is on the coffee table.\n\n3. **Combining the premises:** Since we know the remote control is *not necessarily* under the couch (from premise 1), the only remaining possibility from premise 2 is that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
