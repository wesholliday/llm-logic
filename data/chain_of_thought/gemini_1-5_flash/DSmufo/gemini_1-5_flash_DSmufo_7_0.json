It could be elsewhere.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car.\" This means there are only two possibilities: the umbrella is in the closet, or it's in the car.\n\n3. **Combining the premises:** Since we know the umbrella isn't necessarily in the closet (from premise 1), and it must be in one of the two places (from premise 2), the only remaining possibility is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
