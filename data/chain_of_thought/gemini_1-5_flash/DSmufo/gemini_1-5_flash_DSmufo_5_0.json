They could be elsewhere.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar.\" This presents two possibilities: \n    * **Possibility A:** The cookies are in the pantry.\n    * **Possibility B:** The cookies are in the jar.\n\n3. **Combining the premises:** Since we know the cookies are *not* necessarily in the pantry (from Premise 1), we can eliminate Possibility A. \n\n4. **Conclusion:** This leaves us with only Possibility B: The cookies are in the jar.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
