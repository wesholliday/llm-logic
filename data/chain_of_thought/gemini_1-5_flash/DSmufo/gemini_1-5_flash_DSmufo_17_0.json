It could be elsewhere.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack.\" This presents two possibilities:\n    * The scarf is on the coat rack.\n    * The scarf is in the backpack.\n\n3. **Combining the premises:** Since we know the scarf is *not* necessarily on the coat rack (from premise 1), the only remaining possibility from premise 2 is that the scarf is in the backpack.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
