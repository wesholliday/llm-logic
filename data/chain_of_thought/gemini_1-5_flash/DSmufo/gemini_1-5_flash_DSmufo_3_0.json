They could be elsewhere.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\" This presents two possibilities:\n    * The keys are dangling in the cabinet.\n    * The keys are in the drawer.\n\n3. **Combining the premises:** Since we know the keys are *not* necessarily dangling in the cabinet (from premise 1), the only remaining possibility from premise 2 is that the keys are in the drawer.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
