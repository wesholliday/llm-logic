It could be elsewhere.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"Either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway.\" This means there are only two possibilities: the newspaper is on the porch, or it's in the driveway.\n\n3. **Combining the premises:** Since we know the newspaper isn't *necessarily* on the porch (from premise 1), and it must be in one of the two places (from premise 2), the only remaining possibility is that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
