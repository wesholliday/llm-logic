It could be elsewhere.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser.\" This means there are only two possibilities: the watch is on his wrist, or it's charging on the dresser.\n\n3. **Combining the premises:** Since we know the watch isn't necessarily on his wrist (from premise 1), the only remaining possibility from premise 2 is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
