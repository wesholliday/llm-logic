It says that if the book *was* written by James, then it *must* be a mystery novel. \n* Since the book was *not* written by James (premise 1), the condition in premise 2 is not met. \n* Therefore, we cannot conclude anything about whether the book is a mystery novel or not based on premise 2.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
