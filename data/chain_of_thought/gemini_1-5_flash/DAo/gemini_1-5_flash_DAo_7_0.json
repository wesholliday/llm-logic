Since Alex did not finish the race (Premise 1), the \"if\" part of the conditional statement is false.  In logic, when the \"if\" part of a conditional statement is false, the entire statement is considered true, regardless of the truth value of the \"then\" part. \n4. **Conclusion:** We cannot infer whether Chris finished the race or not.  The conditional statement only tells us what would have happened if Alex had finished. It doesn't tell us anything about what happened since Alex didn't finish.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
