It says that if the first part (Sam taking a plane) is true, then the second part (Erin taking a train) must also be true. \n5. **Apply Premise 1:** Since we know Sam did not take a plane (Premise 1), the first part of the conditional statement (Premise 2) is false.\n6. **Conditional Logic:** When the first part of a conditional statement is false, the entire statement is considered true, regardless of the truth value of the second part. \n7. **Conclusion:**  We cannot conclude that Erin did not take a train.  The conditional statement (Premise 2) is true, but it doesn't tell us anything about what Erin did if Sam didn't take a plane. Erin could have taken a train, or she could have taken something else.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
