It says that if the first part (the cake was chocolate) is true, then the second part (the muffins were blueberry) must also be true.\n* Premise 1 tells us the first part of the conditional statement is false (the cake was not chocolate).\n* When the first part of a conditional statement is false, the statement itself is considered true, regardless of whether the second part is true or false. \n* Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the muffins from the given information. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
