(This is the contrapositive of premise 2, which is logically equivalent).\n\nNow, we can see that premise 1 and the contrapositive of premise 2 both state that the apple was not red. This means that both premises are true. \n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the contrapositive of premise 2 is true, and we know the banana was not yellow, we can infer that the banana was not yellow.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
