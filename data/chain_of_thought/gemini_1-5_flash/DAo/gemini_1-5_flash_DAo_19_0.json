Since Tom did not watch football (Premise 1), the \"if\" part of the conditional statement is false. \n4. **Logic:** In logic, if the \"if\" part of a conditional statement is false, the entire statement is considered true, regardless of the truth value of the \"then\" part.\n5. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we cannot infer whether Jen watched basketball or not. The conditional statement (Premise 2) is true, but it doesn't tell us anything about Jen's actions.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
