It says that if the first part (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the second part (Amy playing tennis) must also be true. \n5. **Apply Premise 1:** Since we know Jeff did NOT play basketball, the first part of the conditional statement is false.\n6. **Conditional Logic:** When the first part of a conditional statement is false, the statement itself is considered true, regardless of the truth value of the second part. \n7. **Conclusion:**  We cannot infer that Amy did not play tennis.  The conditional statement doesn't tell us anything about what Amy did if Jeff didn't play basketball. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
