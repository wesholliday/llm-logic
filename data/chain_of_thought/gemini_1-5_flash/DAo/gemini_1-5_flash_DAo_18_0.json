It says that if the doll is plastic, then a specific consequence follows (the truck being metal).\n* Premise 1 tells us the antecedent (the doll being plastic) is false.\n* When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the statement itself is considered true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent (the truck being metal).\n* Therefore, we cannot infer that the truck was not metal.  The truck could be metal or not, and it wouldn't contradict the given information.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
