It states that if the first part (the smonk was vreebled) is true, then the second part (the smonk plagged) must also be true.\n\n3. **Apply the concept of Modus Tollens:** Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that says:\n   - If P, then Q.\n   - Not Q.\n   - Therefore, not P.\n\n4. **Match the premises to Modus Tollens:**\n   - P: The smonk was vreebled.\n   - Q: The smonk plagged.\n   - Not Q: The smonk was not plagged.\n\n5. **Apply Modus Tollens:** Since we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q\", we can infer \"Not P\".  This means we can infer \"The smonk was not vreebled\".\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
