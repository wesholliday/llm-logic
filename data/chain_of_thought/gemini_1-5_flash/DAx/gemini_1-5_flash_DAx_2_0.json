It states that if the first part (the wug was flooped) is true, then the second part (the wug bimmed the zoint) must also be true.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of Modus Tollens:** Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that says:\n   - If P then Q.\n   - Not Q.\n   - Therefore, not P.\n\n4. **Match the premises to Modus Tollens:**\n   - P: The wug was flooped.\n   - Q: The wug bimmed the zoint.\n   - Not Q: The wug did not bim the zoint.\n\n5. **Apply Modus Tollens:** Since we have \"If P then Q\" and \"Not Q\", we can infer \"Not P\".\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
