Not Q. Therefore, not P. \n4. **Applying Modus Tollens:**  We can apply Modus Tollens to our premises.  Since the antecedent (\"zinger was fraggled\") is false, and the conditional statement is true, we can conclude that the consequent (\"zinger was smoogled\") must also be false.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
