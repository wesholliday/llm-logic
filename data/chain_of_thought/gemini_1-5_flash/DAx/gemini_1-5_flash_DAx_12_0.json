It means that if the first part (the smip was shripped) is true, then the second part (the smip lupped the zoint) must also be true.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The smip was not shripped.\" This tells us the first part of the conditional statement is false.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  Since the first part of the conditional statement is false, we cannot conclude anything about the second part. The conditional statement only tells us what happens *if* the first part is true. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the first part is false.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
