It states that if the first part (the whiffle was shanked) is true, then the second part (the whiffle tinked) must also be true.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of Modus Tollens:** Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that says:\n   - If P then Q.\n   - Not Q.\n   - Therefore, not P.\n\n4. **Match the premises to Modus Tollens:**\n   - P: The whiffle was shanked.\n   - Q: The whiffle tinked.\n   - Not Q: The whiffle did not tink.\n\n5. **Apply Modus Tollens:** Since we know \"The whiffle was not shanked\" (not Q), and the conditional statement \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\" is true, we can conclude that \"The whiffle did not tink\" (not P).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
