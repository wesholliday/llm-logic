It tells us that if the flugel is blimmed, then it must also be zargled. \n2. **Premise 2:** \"The flugel was not blimmed.\" This tells us the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional statement is false.\n3. **Reasoning:**  Since the antecedent of the conditional statement is false, we cannot conclude anything about the consequent (the \"then\" part).  The conditional statement only tells us what happens *if* the flugel is blimmed. It doesn't say anything about what happens if it's not blimmed.\n4. **Conclusion:** We cannot infer that \"The flugel was not zargled.\" It's possible that the flugel was zargled for some other reason, even though it wasn't blimmed.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
