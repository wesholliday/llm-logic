It means that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have surned. \n2. **Premise 2:** \"The fleeg was not bluttered.\" This tells us the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional statement is false.\n3. **Reasoning:**  When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, we cannot conclude anything about the truth of the consequent (the \"then\" part).  \n4. **Example:** Consider the statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" If it's not raining, we can't say for sure whether the ground is wet or not. There could be other reasons for the ground being wet.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
