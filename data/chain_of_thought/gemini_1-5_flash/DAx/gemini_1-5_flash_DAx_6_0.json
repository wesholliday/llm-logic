It states:\n    * If P then Q.\n    * Not P.\n    * Therefore, not Q.\n\n3. **Applying Modus Tollens:**\n    *  Let P = \"The grommet was sploffed\"\n    *  Let Q = \"The grommet plopped the frink\"\n\n    *  We have \"If P then Q\" (from the first premise)\n    *  We have \"Not P\" (from the second premise)\n\n    *  Therefore, we can conclude \"Not Q\" (i.e., \"The grommet did not plop the frink\").\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
