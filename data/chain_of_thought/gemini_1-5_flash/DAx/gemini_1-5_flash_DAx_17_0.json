It states that if the first part (the flob was skizzled) is true, then the second part (the flob movated) must also be true.\n    * Premise 2 tells us that the first part of the conditional statement is false.\n\n3. **Applying logic:**\n    * Since the first part of the conditional statement is false, we cannot conclude anything about the truth value of the second part. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if the first part is true. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the first part is false.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n    * We cannot infer that the flob was not movated. It's possible that the flob movated for some other reason, even though it wasn't skizzled.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
