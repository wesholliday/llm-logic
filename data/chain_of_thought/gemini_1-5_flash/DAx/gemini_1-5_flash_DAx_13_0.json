This doesn't mean that if the glip wasn't slogged, it couldn't be tragged. It simply states a relationship between being slogged and being tragged.\n\n3. **Applying the second premise:**  We know the glip was not slogged.  Since the conditional statement only applies when the glip *is* slogged, we can't use it to draw a conclusion about whether the glip was tragged or not.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** We cannot infer that the glip was not tragged. The second premise only tells us about the glip's slogged status, not its tragged status.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
