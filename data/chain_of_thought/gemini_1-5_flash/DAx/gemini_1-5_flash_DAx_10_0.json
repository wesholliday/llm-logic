It means that if the wug was sproinged, then it must also be garpled. \n2. **Premise 2:** \"The wug was not sproinged.\" This tells us the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional statement is false.\n3. **Reasoning:**  Since the antecedent is false, we cannot conclude anything about the consequent (the \"then\" part). The conditional statement only tells us what happens if the antecedent is true. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the antecedent is false.\n4. **Conclusion:** We cannot infer that \"The wug was not garpled.\"\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
