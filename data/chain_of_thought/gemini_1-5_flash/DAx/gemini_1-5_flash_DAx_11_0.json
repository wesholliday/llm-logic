In this case, P is \"the flug was blummed\" and Q is \"the flug was zimmed\".\n2. **Consider the second statement:** The second statement tells us that P is false (\"The flug was not blummed\").\n3. **Apply the rules of logic:**  A conditional statement is only false if the antecedent (P) is true and the consequent (Q) is false. Since we know P is false, the conditional statement could be true even if Q is false. \n4. **Conclusion:** We cannot infer that Q is false.  \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
