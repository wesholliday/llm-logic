It states: If P then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P. \n4. **Applying Modus Tollens:**  We can apply Modus Tollens to our premises.  \n    * P: The sprocket was cranked.\n    * Q: The sprocket was daggled.\n    * We know \"not Q\" (the sprocket was not daggled) is true.\n5. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we can infer \"not P\" (the sprocket was not cranked).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
