It tells us that if the first part (the shank was plooked) is true, then the second part (the shank was nugged) must also be true.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The shank was not plooked.\" This tells us the first part of the conditional statement is false.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  Since the first part of the conditional statement is false, we cannot conclude anything about the truth of the second part. The conditional statement only guarantees that the second part is true *if* the first part is true. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the first part is false.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
