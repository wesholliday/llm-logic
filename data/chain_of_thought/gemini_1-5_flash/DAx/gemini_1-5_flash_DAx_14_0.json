It states that if the first part (the clug was fleeked) is true, then the second part (the clug snugged) must also be true.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of Modus Tollens:** Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that says:\n   - If P then Q.\n   - Not Q.\n   - Therefore, not P.\n\n4. **Match the premises to Modus Tollens:**\n   - P: The clug was fleeked.\n   - Q: The clug snugged.\n   - Not Q: The clug was not snugged.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since we have both the conditional statement (Premise 1) and the negation of the consequent (Premise 2), we can infer the negation of the antecedent. Therefore, we can infer \"The clug was not snugged.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
