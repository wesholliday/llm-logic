It tells us that if the splat was morphed, then it definitely quanked. However, it doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the splat wasn't morphed. \n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The splat was not morphed.\" This tells us the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional statement is false.\n\n3. **Inference:**  We cannot infer \"The splat did not quank\" from these premises.  Here's why:\n\n    * The conditional statement only tells us what happens *if* the splat is morphed. It doesn't say anything about what happens if it's *not* morphed. The splat could have quanked for some other reason, even if it wasn't morphed.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
