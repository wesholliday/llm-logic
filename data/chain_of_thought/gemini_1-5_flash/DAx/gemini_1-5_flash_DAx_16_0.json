It states that if the first part (the sneg was crampled) is true, then the second part (the sneg sproted the frink) must also be true.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of Modus Tollens:** Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that says:\n   - If P then Q.\n   - Not Q.\n   - Therefore, not P.\n\n4. **Match the premises to Modus Tollens:**\n   - P: The sneg was crampled.\n   - Q: The sneg sproted the frink.\n   - Not Q: The sneg did not sprot the frink.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since we have both the conditional statement (Premise 1) and the negation of the consequent (Premise 2), we can infer the negation of the antecedent. Therefore, we can infer that \"The sneg did not sprot the frink.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
