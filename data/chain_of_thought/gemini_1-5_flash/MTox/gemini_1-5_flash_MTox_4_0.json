It means that if the fribble was \"snurgled,\" then it *must* have \"crinked.\"\n\n3. **Reasoning:** Since we know from Premise 1 that the fribble did not crink, and Premise 2 states that crinking is a necessary consequence of being snurgled, we can conclude that the fribble could not have been snurgled. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
