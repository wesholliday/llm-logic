It says that if the dreb was vroombed, then a certain consequence (being spened) must follow.  Premise 1 tells us that the consequence did not happen (the dreb was not spened). \n\n5. **Applying Modus Tollens:**  This situation fits the logical rule called Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens states:\n    * If P then Q.\n    * Not Q.\n    * Therefore, not P.\n\n6. **Applying Modus Tollens to our problem:**\n    * P: The dreb was vroombed.\n    * Q: The dreb was spened.\n    * We know \"Not Q\" (the dreb was not spened).\n    * Therefore, we can infer \"Not P\" (the dreb was not vroombed).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
