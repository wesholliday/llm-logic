It means that if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  We know from Premise 1 that the splat did not quank. Since the conditional statement in Premise 2 says that quanking is a consequence of being morphed, and the splat did not quank, then the splat cannot have been morphed.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
