It says that if the whiffle was shanked, then a certain consequence (tinking) must follow.  Since we know from Premise 1 that the whiffle did *not* tink, we can conclude that the antecedent (the whiffle being shanked) must be false. This is because if the antecedent were true, the consequent (tinking) would also have to be true, which contradicts Premise 1.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
