It means that if the smonk was \"vreebled\", then it must have \"plagged\".\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  We know from Premise 1 that the smonk did not \"plagged\".  Since Premise 2 states that \"plagged\" is a consequence of being \"vreebled\", we can infer that the smonk could not have been \"vreebled\". If it had been, it would have \"plagged\".\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
