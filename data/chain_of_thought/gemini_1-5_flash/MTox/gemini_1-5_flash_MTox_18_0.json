If the antecedent (the shank was plooked) is true, then the consequent (the shank was nugged) must also be true.  However, Premise 1 tells us the consequent is false. \n5. **Modus Tollens:**  This situation fits the logical rule called Modus Tollens.  Modus Tollens states: If P then Q.  Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n6. **Applying Modus Tollens:** In our case, P is \"the shank was plooked\" and Q is \"the shank was nugged.\"  Since we know \"not Q\" (the shank was not nugged), we can infer \"not P\" (the shank was not plooked).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
