It means that if the clug was fleeked, then it must have been snugged.\n\n3. **Applying Logic:**  We know the clug was not snugged (from Premise 1). Since the conditional statement (Premise 2) says that being fleeked *implies* being snugged, and the clug wasn't snugged, then it couldn't have been fleeked.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
