It tells us that if the twonk was plinked, then a certain consequence (being varnished) must follow.  Since we know from Premise 1 that the twonk was *not* varnished, we can conclude that the antecedent (the twonk being plinked) cannot be true.  If it were true, the consequent (being varnished) would also have to be true, which contradicts Premise 1.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
