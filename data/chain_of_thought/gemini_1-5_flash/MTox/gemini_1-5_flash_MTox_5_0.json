If the antecedent (the zinger was fraggled) is true, then the consequent (the zinger was smoogled) must also be true.  However, Premise 1 tells us the consequent is false.  Therefore, the antecedent must also be false.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since the antecedent of Premise 2 (\"the zinger was fraggled\") must be false, we can infer that \"The zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
