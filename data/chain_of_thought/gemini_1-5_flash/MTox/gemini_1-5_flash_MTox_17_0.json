It means that if the flob was skizzled, then it must have movated.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  We know from Premise 1 that the flob did not movate. Since the conditional statement in Premise 2 says that movating is a consequence of being skizzled, and the flob did not movate, then the flob cannot have been skizzled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
