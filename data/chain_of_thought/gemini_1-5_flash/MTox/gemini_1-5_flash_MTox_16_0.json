It means that if the sneg was \"crampled,\" then it must have \"sproted\" the frink.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  We know from Premise 1 that the sneg did not sproted the frink.  Since Premise 2 states that \"sproting\" the frink is a consequence of being \"crampled,\" we can infer that the sneg could not have been \"crampled.\" If it had been, it would have \"sproted\" the frink, which we know didn't happen.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
