It doesn't exclude the possibility of the frazzle being in both. The statement \"The frazzle must be in flibbit or it must be in frozz\" implies that the frazzle must be in one place and only one place. Since the original statement doesn't exclude the possibility of the frazzle being in both places, we cannot infer the second statement.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
