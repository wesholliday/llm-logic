            "content": "Explanation: The original statement says the zibber *must* do one of two things: gronk a quank or gronk a zump crunk.  This implies that it is not possible for the zibber to do neither.  The second statement says the zibber *must* gronk a quank or it *must* gronk a zump crunk. This implies that it is not possible for the zibber to do only one of the two actions. Since the original statement allows for the zibber to do only one of the two actions, the second statement is not a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
