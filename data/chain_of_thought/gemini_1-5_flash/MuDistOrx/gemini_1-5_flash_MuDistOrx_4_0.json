It doesn't exclude the possibility of it being in both places. The second statement is more restrictive, saying the grazzle must be in the flim *or* it must be on the grooble, implying it can't be in both. Since the original statement allows for the grazzle to be in both, we cannot infer the second statement.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
