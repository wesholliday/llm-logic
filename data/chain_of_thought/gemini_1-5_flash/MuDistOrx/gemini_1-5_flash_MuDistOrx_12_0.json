            "content": "Explanation: The original statement says that the quibble *must* be floob on the froodle *or* be snork on the zump. This implies that there are only two possibilities: either the quibble is floob on the froodle, or it is snork on the zump.  There is no third option, and it is not possible for the quibble to be both floob on the froodle and snork on the zump. Therefore, if the quibble is not floob on the froodle, it *must* be snork on the zump.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
