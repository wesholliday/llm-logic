This means there's no other option, it has to be wumped by one of those two. The second statement says the blimp *must* be wumped by the frazzle blimple *or* it *must* be wumped by the plimp. This is essentially the same thing as the original statement, just rephrased. Both statements are saying the blimp has to be wumped by one of those two options. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
