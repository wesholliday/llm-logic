The statement \"The room must have been cleaned daily or as requested\" includes the possibility of the room being cleaned daily, but also allows for the possibility of it being cleaned only when requested. Since the first statement implies daily cleaning, it is a stronger statement than the second statement. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
