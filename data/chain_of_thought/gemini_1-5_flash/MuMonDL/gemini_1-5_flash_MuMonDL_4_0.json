The statement \"The meeting must have been scheduled for 2 PM or been rescheduled\" includes the possibility that the meeting was rescheduled. Since the original statement implies that the meeting was scheduled for 2 PM, it also implies that it could have been rescheduled. Therefore, the second statement can be inferred from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
