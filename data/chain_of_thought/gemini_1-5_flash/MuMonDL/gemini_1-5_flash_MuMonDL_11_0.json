The statement \"The software must have been updated or replaced\" implies that the software is either in a newer version or is a completely different piece of software. Since updating software does not necessarily mean replacing it, the second statement is broader than the first.  Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
