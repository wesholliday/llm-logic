The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n3. **Applying the contrapositive:**  The contrapositive of our original statement is \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\"\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
