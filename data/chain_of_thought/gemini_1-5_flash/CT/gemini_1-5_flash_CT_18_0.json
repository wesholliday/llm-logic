The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n3. **Applying the contrapositive:**  The contrapositive of our original statement is \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\".\n4. **Logical equivalence:** A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they have the same truth value. If one is true, the other is also true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
