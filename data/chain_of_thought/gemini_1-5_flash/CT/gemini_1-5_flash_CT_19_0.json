The original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.\n4. **Contrapositive of the original statement:** \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"\n5. **Conclusion:** Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
