This is a fundamental principle in logic.\n\n5. **Determine if the inference is valid:** Since the desired inference is the contrapositive of the original statement, and the contrapositive is always true if the original statement is true, we can infer that the desired inference is valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
