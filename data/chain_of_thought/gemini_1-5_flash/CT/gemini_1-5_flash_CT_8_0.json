It doesn't say anything about what happens if the vampire is asleep.\n3. **The question:** Can we infer \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake\"? This is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n4. **Contrapositives:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means they have the same truth value.\n5. **Reasoning:** If the mummy is not awake, then the vampire cannot be awake (because the original statement said the vampire being awake implies the mummy is awake).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
