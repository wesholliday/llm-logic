It doesn't say anything about what happens if Jeff *didn't* play basketball.\n3. **The inferred statement:** \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n4. **Contrapositives and logic:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means they have the same truth value. If the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
