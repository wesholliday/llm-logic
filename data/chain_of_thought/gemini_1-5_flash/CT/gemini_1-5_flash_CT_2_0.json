So, the contrapositive of our original statement is \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\"\n3. **Equivalence:** A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they have the same truth value. If one is true, the other is also true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
