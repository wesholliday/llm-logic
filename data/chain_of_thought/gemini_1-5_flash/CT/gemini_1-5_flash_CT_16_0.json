So, the contrapositive of our original statement is \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\"\n3. **Equivalence:** A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they have the same truth value. If one is true, the other must also be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
