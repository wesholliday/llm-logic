It doesn't say anything about what happens if Joe *didn't* go to the park.\n3. **The inferred statement:** \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n4. **Contrapositives and logic:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means they have the same truth value. \n5. **Conclusion:** Since the inferred statement is the contrapositive of the original statement, we can infer it.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
