So, the contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n3. **Apply the contrapositive to the original statement:**  The contrapositive of \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\".\n\n4. **Determine if the contrapositive is logically equivalent:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means they have the same truth value.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
