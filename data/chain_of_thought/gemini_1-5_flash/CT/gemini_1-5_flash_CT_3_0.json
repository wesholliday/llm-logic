The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n3. **Form the contrapositive of the original statement:** Applying this to our original statement, the contrapositive is \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James\".\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
