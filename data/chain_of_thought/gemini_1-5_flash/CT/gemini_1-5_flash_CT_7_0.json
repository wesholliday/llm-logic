It doesn't say anything about what happens if Alex *didn't* finish.\n3. **The inferred statement:** \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n4. **Contrapositives and logic:** In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
