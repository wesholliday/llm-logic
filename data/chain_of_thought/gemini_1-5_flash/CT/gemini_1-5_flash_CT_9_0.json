It doesn't say anything about what happens if Lisa *didn't* buy the red shirt.\n3. **The question:** \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n4. **Contrapositives:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
