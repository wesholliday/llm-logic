It states that if the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since Premise 1 states that Lisa bought the red shirt, and Premise 2 tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt, we can infer that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
