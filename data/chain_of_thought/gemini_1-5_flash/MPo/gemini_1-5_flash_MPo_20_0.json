It states that if the first part (the apple being red) is true, then the second part (the banana being yellow) must also be true.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since Premise 1 tells us the first part of the conditional statement is true (the apple was red), we can infer that the second part must also be true (the banana was yellow).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
