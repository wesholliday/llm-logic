It states that if the first part (the cake being chocolate) is true, then the second part (the muffins being blueberry) must also be true.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since Premise 1 tells us the first part of the conditional statement is true, we can infer that the second part must also be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
