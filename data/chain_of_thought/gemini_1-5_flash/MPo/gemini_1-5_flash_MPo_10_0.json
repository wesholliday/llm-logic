It tells us that if the first part (the dog being inside) is true, then the second part (the cat being outside) must also be true.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since we know from Premise 1 that the dog was inside, and Premise 2 tells us that if the dog was inside, the cat was outside, we can infer that the cat was outside.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
