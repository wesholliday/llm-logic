It tells us that if the first part (the bear being in the cave) is true, then the second part (the wolf being in the den) must also be true.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since we know from Premise 1 that the bear was in the cave, and Premise 2 tells us that if the bear is in the cave, the wolf must be in the den, we can infer that the wolf was in the den.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
