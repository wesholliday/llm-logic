It says that if the first part (Tom watching football) is true, then the second part (Jen watching basketball) must also be true.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since we know from Premise 1 that the first part of the conditional statement is true, we can infer that the second part must also be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
