It says that if the first part (Alex finishing) is true, then the second part (Chris finishing) must also be true.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since we know from Premise 1 that Alex finished the race, and Premise 2 tells us that if Alex finished, then Chris must have finished, we can infer that Chris finished the race.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
