It states that if the first part (Joe went to the park) is true, then the second part (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since we know from Premise 1 that Joe went to the park, and Premise 2 tells us that if Joe went to the park, Lucy went to the zoo, we can infer that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
