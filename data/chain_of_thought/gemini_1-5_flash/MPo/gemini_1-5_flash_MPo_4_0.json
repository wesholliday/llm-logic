It states that if the first part (the alien visited Mars) is true, then the second part (the robot visited Jupiter) must also be true.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since Premise 1 states that the alien visited Mars, and Premise 2 tells us that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter, we can conclude that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
