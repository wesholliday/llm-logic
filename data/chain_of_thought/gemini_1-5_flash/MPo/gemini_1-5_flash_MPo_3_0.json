It states that if the first part is true (the book was written by James), then the second part must also be true (the book is a mystery novel).\n4. **Conclusion:** Since Premise 1 states that the first part of the conditional statement is true, we can infer that the second part is also true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
