The contrapositive of \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\" is \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n5. **Conclusion:** Since we know Bob might not have chosen pasta, and the contrapositive is true, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
