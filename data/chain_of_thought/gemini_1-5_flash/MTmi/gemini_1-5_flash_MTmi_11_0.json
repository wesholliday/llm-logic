A conditional statement is only false when the first part is true and the second part is false. \n4. **Conclusion:** Since the second part of the conditional statement (the muffins being blueberry) might be false, we cannot definitively say the first part (the cake being chocolate) is true. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
