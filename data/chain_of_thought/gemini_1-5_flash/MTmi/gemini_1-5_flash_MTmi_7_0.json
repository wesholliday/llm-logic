It means that if Alex finished, Chris *must* have also finished. \n2. **Premise 2:** \"Chris might not have finished the race.\" This tells us that it's possible Chris didn't finish. \n3. **Reasoning:**  If Chris didn't finish, then according to Premise 1, Alex couldn't have finished either. This is because the statement \"If Alex finished, then Chris must have finished\" implies that Chris finishing is a necessary condition for Alex finishing.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since it's possible Chris didn't finish, it's also possible Alex didn't finish. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
