It tells us that the vampire being awake is a sufficient condition for the mummy being awake. \n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The mummy might not have been awake.\" This tells us that the mummy was possibly asleep. It doesn't definitively say the mummy was asleep, but it allows for that possibility.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  If the mummy might not have been awake, then it's possible that the vampire wasn't awake either.  This is because the first premise states that the vampire being awake *requires* the mummy to be awake. If the mummy wasn't awake, then the vampire couldn't have been awake.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
