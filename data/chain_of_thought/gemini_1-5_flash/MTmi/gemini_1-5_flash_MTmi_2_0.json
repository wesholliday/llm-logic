This is because the conditional statement in Premise 1 implies that the unicorn's presence is necessary for the griffin's presence.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since it's possible the unicorn wasn't in the forest, it's also possible the griffin wasn't in the forest. We can't definitively say the griffin *was not* in the forest.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
