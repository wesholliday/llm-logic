It means that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants *must* be denim. \n2. **Premise 2:** \"The pants might not have been denim.\" This tells us that the pants could have been denim, but they also could have been something else. \n3. **Reasoning:**  If the pants were not denim, then the shirt could not have been cotton (because of Premise 1). However, Premise 2 only says the pants *might* not have been denim, not that they definitely weren't. \n4. **Conclusion:** We cannot definitively conclude that the shirt was not cotton. It's possible the pants were denim, even though they might not have been.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
