It means that Mary's presence at the wedding implies Sue's presence.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"Sue might not have been at the wedding.\" This means it's possible Sue wasn't at the wedding.\n\n3. **Reasoning:** If Sue wasn't at the wedding, then according to Premise 1, Mary couldn't have been there either. However, Premise 2 only states that Sue *might* not have been there, not that she definitely wasn't. It's possible Sue was at the wedding, even though it's also possible she wasn't.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** We cannot definitively infer that Mary was not at the wedding. It's possible she was, and it's possible she wasn't.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
