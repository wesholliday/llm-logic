However, Premise 2 only states that the book *might* not be a mystery novel. It doesn't definitively say it *is* not a mystery novel. \n4. **Conclusion:** We cannot definitively infer that the book was not written by James. It's possible the book is a mystery novel, even though it might not be.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
