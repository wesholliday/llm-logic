It tells us that if the first part is true (the book was written by James), then the second part must also be true (the book is a mystery novel).\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The book is a mystery novel.\" This tells us the second part of the conditional statement is true.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  We know the book is a mystery novel. However, the conditional statement only tells us what happens *if* the book was written by James. It doesn't tell us that James is the *only* author who writes mystery novels. There could be other authors who write mystery novels.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** We cannot logically deduce that the book was written by James.  \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
