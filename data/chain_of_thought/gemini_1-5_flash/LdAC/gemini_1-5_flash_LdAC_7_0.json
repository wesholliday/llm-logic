It tells us that if Alex finished, then Chris must have also finished. \n2. **Premise 2:** \"Chris finished the race.\" This tells us that Chris did indeed finish the race.\n3. **Reasoning:**  We know Chris finished. The first premise tells us that if Alex finished, Chris would have finished. Since Chris did finish, it doesn't necessarily mean Alex finished.  The statement doesn't say anything about what happens if Chris finishes, only what happens if Alex finishes. \n4. **Example:** Imagine a scenario where Chris finished the race, but Alex didn't. This scenario is consistent with both premises.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
