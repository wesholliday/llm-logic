The conditional statement only tells us what happens *if* the vampire is awake. It doesn't tell us what happens if the mummy is awake. The mummy could be awake for other reasons.\n4. **Example:** Imagine the mummy is awake because it's being controlled by a sorcerer, not because the vampire is awake.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
