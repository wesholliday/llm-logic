It doesn't say anything about what happens if the car is *not* red.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of Modus Ponens:**\n   - Modus Ponens is a valid argument form that says: If P, then Q. P is true. Therefore, Q is true.\n   - In our case, P is \"The car was red\" and Q is \"The truck was blue.\"\n   - We know Q is true (Premise 2).\n   - However, Modus Ponens only allows us to conclude Q is true if P is true. It doesn't work the other way around.\n\n4. **Consider the possibility of other scenarios:**\n   - The truck could be blue for reasons other than the car being red. Maybe the truck was always blue, regardless of the car's color.\n\n**Conclusion:** We cannot logically deduce that the car was red based on the given premises.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
