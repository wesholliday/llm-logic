It doesn't say the bear *was* in the cave, only that *if* it was, then the wolf was in the den.\n\n2. **The second statement:** \"The wolf was in the den.\" This tells us the consequence of the conditional statement is true.\n\n3. **The question:** Can we deduce \"The bear was in the cave\"?  \n\n4. **Reasoning:**  The conditional statement doesn't guarantee the bear was in the cave. The wolf could be in the den for other reasons.  The wolf being in the den doesn't automatically mean the bear was in the cave.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
