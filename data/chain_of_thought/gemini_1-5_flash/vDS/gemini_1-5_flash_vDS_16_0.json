            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the argument's form:** The argument uses the logical structure of disjunctive syllogism. This means it starts with an \"either/or\" statement (disjunction) and then eliminates one possibility, leading to the conclusion that the remaining possibility must be true.\n\n2. **Analyzing the premises:**\n    * Premise 1: \"Either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk.\" This sets up the disjunction.\n    * Premise 2: \"The pen isn't on my desk.\" This eliminates one possibility from the disjunction.\n\n3. **Evaluating the conclusion:** The conclusion, \"The pen is in my bag,\" directly follows from the premises. If the pen isn't on the desk, and it must be either in the bag or on the desk, then it must be in the bag.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
