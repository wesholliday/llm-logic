It only states what happens *if* the dog was inside. \n* The fact that the cat was outside (Premise 2) is consistent with the conditional statement, but it doesn't prove the dog was inside. \n* The dog could have been outside as well, and the cat still would have been outside.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
