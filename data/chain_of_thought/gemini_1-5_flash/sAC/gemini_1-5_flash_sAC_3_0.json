It means that if the first part is true (the book was written by James), then the second part must also be true (the book is a mystery novel).\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The book is a mystery novel.\" This tells us the second part of the conditional statement is true.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  We know the conditional statement is true, and we know the second part of the statement is true. However, this doesn't automatically mean the first part is true. There could be other authors who write mystery novels.\n\n**Example:** Imagine a scenario where Agatha Christie also wrote a mystery novel. The statement \"The book is a mystery novel\" would still be true, but the book might not have been written by James.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
