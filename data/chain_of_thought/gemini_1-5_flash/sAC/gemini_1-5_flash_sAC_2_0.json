This is a conditional statement.\n2. **The second given statement:** \"The unicorn was in the forest\" is true. This is the consequent of the conditional statement.\n3. **The question:** Does it follow that \"The griffin was in the forest\" is true? This is asking if the antecedent of the conditional statement is also true.\n4. **Reasoning:**  The truth of the consequent (the unicorn being in the forest) does not automatically guarantee the truth of the antecedent (the griffin being in the forest).  The conditional statement only says what happens *if* the griffin is in the forest. It doesn't say that the griffin *must* be in the forest if the unicorn is. \n5. **Example:** Imagine a scenario where the unicorn is in the forest, but the griffin is elsewhere. This scenario satisfies both given statements.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
