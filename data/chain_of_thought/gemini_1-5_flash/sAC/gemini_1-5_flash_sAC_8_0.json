It means that if the vampire is awake, the mummy must also be awake. \n2. **The second given statement:** \"The mummy was awake\" tells us that the consequence of the conditional statement is true.\n3. **The question:** Does it follow that \"The vampire was awake\" is true? This asks if the antecedent (the first part) of the conditional statement is also true.\n4. **Reasoning:**  We know the conditional statement is true, and we know the consequence is true. However, this doesn't automatically mean the antecedent is true. There could be other reasons why the mummy was awake, even if the vampire wasn't. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
