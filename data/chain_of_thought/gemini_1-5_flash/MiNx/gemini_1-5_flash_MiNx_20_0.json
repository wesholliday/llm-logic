It allows for the possibility that it wasn't bluttered.\n\n2. **Reasoning:**\n    * If the fleeg might not have been bluttered, it means it's possible it wasn't bluttered. \n    * This possibility aligns with the statement that it's not a certainty the fleeg was bluttered.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n    * Since the first statement allows for the possibility that the fleeg wasn't bluttered, we can infer the second statement.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
