It doesn't rule out the possibility that it was shanked.\n   - \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked\" means it's not certain that the whiffle was shanked. There could be other possibilities.\n\n2. **Relationship between the statements:**\n   - If the whiffle might not have been shanked, it logically follows that it's not certain it was shanked. \n\n3. **Inference:**\n   - We can infer the second statement from the first.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
