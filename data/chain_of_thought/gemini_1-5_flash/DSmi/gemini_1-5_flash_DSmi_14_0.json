It doesn't definitively say it's *not* in the fridge, just that it might not be.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  Since the milk can only be in one place, and it *might* not be in the fridge, then it *could* be on the counter. However, we can't definitively say it *is* on the counter. It's possible the milk is in a third location, or that it's simply not there at all.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
