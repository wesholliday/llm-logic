No, we can't.  \n\n4. **Reasoning:**  Premise 2 leaves open the possibility that the sunglasses are *not* on her head. If they are not on her head, and they can't be in both places (due to the exclusive OR), then they *could* be in her bag. However, it's also possible they are somewhere else entirely. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
