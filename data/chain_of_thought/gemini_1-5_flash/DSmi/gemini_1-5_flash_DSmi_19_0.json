It could be true, but it also could be false.\n\n3. **Inference:** Can we infer \"The watch is charging on the dresser\"?  Since the second possibility is not certain, the first possibility (watch charging on the dresser) becomes the more likely explanation. However, it's not a definite conclusion. It's possible the watch is not charging on the dresser, but is instead on his wrist.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
