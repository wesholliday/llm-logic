It means the toy can be in one place *or* the other, but not both.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\" This statement doesn't definitively say the toy *isn't* on the bookshelf, but it leaves open the possibility that it's not there.\n\n3. **Inference:**  Since the toy *might not* be on the bookshelf, there's a possibility it's in the toy box. However, we can't definitively conclude that it *is* in the toy box. The toy could be in a third location entirely.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
