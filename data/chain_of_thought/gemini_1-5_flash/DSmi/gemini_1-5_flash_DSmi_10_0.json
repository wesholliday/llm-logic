No, we can't.  \n\n4. **Reasoning:**  Premise 2 leaves open the possibility that the sock is *not* under the bed. If it's not under the bed, and it can't be in both places (due to the exclusive OR), then it *could* be in the laundry basket. However, it's also possible the sock is somewhere else entirely. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
