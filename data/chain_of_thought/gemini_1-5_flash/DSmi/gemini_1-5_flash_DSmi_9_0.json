It doesn't definitively rule out Possibility B, but it makes it less likely.\n\n3. **Inference:** Can we infer \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box\"?  No, we cannot definitively infer this. While Premise 2 weakens Possibility B, it doesn't eliminate it entirely. It's still possible that the puzzle piece is blending in on the floor, just less likely.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
