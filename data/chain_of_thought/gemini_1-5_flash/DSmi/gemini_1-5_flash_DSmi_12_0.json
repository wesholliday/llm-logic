It means that one of the two options must be true, but not both.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\" This statement implies that the jacket *could* be hanging in the closet, but it doesn't definitively say it is. It leaves open the possibility that the jacket is not in the closet.\n\n3. **Reasoning:** If the jacket is not in the closet (as suggested by Premise 2), then based on Premise 1, the only remaining possibility is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
