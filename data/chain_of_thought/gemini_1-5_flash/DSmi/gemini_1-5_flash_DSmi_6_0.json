It means that one of the two possibilities is true, but not both.\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The phone might not be ringing in the kitchen.\" This means that the possibility of the phone ringing in the kitchen is not certain. It could be ringing there, or it could not be.\n3. **Inference:** We want to know if we can infer \"The phone is in the living room.\" \n4. **Reasoning:**  Since the phone might not be ringing in the kitchen, the possibility of it being in the living room becomes more likely. However, we cannot be certain. The phone could still be in the kitchen and not ringing. \n5. **Conclusion:** We cannot definitively infer that the phone is in the living room.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
