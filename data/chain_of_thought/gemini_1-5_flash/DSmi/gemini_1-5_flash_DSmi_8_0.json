No, we can't.  \n\n4. **Reasoning:**  Premise 2 leaves open the possibility that the remote control is under the couch. Since Premise 1 states the remote control must be in one place or the other, if it's not under the couch, it could still be somewhere else entirely, not necessarily on the coffee table.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
