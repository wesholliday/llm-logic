It's an exclusive \"or\", meaning it can't be in both places.\n\n2. **The second statement:** \"The pen isn't on my desk\" eliminates one of the possibilities.\n\n3. **Combining the information:** Since the pen can't be on the desk, and it has to be in one of the two places, the only remaining possibility is that it's in the bag.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
