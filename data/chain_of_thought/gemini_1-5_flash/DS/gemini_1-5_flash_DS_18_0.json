It's an exclusive \"or\" meaning it can't be in both places.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand.\" This eliminates one of the possibilities from Premise 1.\n\n3. **Inference:** Since the notebook can't be on the nightstand, and it must be in one of the two locations, the only remaining possibility is that it's in the drawer.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
