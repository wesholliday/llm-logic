It means one of the two things must be true, but not both.\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The smonk might not be plagged.\" This means it's possible the smonk is not plagged.\n3. **Inference:**  We want to know if we can infer \"The smonk is vreebled.\"\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* If the smonk is not plagged (as premise 2 allows), then based on premise 1, it *must* be vreebled. \n* However, premise 2 doesn't definitively state that the smonk *is* not plagged, only that it *might* not be. \n* Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the smonk is vreebled. It's possible the smonk is both plagged and vreebled, which would violate premise 1.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
