It doesn't definitively say it isn't tinked.\n3. **Inference:** \"The whiffle is shanked.\"  To infer this, we need to be certain that the whiffle is *not* tinked. \n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* If the whiffle *is* tinked, then the first premise is satisfied, and the whiffle doesn't have to be shanked. \n* Since the second premise only says the whiffle *might* not be tinked, it leaves open the possibility that it *is* tinked.\n\n**Conclusion:** We cannot definitively infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
