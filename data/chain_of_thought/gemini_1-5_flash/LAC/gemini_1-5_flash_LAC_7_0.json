It tells us that if Alex finished, then Chris must have also finished. \n2. **Premise 2:** \"Chris finished the race.\" This tells us that Chris did indeed finish the race.\n3. **The question:** Can we infer that Alex finished the race? \n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* Premise 1 doesn't tell us anything about what happens if Chris finishes the race. It only tells us what happens if Alex finishes. \n* Premise 2 tells us Chris finished, but it doesn't tell us anything about Alex. \n* It's possible that Chris finished the race without Alex finishing. For example, Alex might have dropped out before the finish line.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
