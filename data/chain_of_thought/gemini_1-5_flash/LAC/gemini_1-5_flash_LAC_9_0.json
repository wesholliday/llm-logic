Premise 2 is the consequent (the \"then\" part) of the conditional statement.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of Modus Ponens:** Modus Ponens is a valid argument form that states: If P, then Q.  P. Therefore, Q. \n\n4. **Match the premises to the rule:**\n   - P: Lisa bought the red shirt.\n   - Q: Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since we have both the conditional statement (Premise 1) and the consequent (Premise 2), we can logically infer the antecedent (Premise 1).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
