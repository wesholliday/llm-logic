This is known as **modus ponens**.\n\n2. **Modus Ponens:** Modus ponens is a valid argument form. It states that if the antecedent (P) is true, and the conditional statement (\"If P, then Q\") is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\n3. **Apply Modus Ponens to the argument:**\n    * P: The cake was chocolate.\n    * Q: The muffins were blueberry.\n    * \"If P, then Q\": If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n    * We are given that Q is true (the muffins were blueberry).\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since we know Q is true and the conditional statement is true, we cannot logically infer that P is true (the cake was chocolate).  The muffins could have been blueberry for other reasons.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
