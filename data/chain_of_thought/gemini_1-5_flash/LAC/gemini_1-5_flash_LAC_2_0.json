It doesn't say the griffin *was* in the forest, only that *if* it was, then the unicorn was also there.\n\n2. **The second statement:** \"The unicorn was in the forest.\" This tells us something about the unicorn's location, but it doesn't directly tell us anything about the griffin.\n\n3. **The question:** Can we infer \"The griffin was in the forest\"?  To do this, we need to see if the second statement *forces* the first statement to be true.\n\n4. **Reasoning:**  The second statement only tells us the unicorn was in the forest. It doesn't tell us anything about the griffin being there. The griffin could have been in the forest, or it could have been somewhere else. The second statement doesn't rule out the possibility of the griffin being elsewhere.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
