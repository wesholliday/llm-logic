It tells us that the vampire being awake is a sufficient condition for the mummy being awake. \n2. **Premise 2:** \"The mummy was awake.\" This tells us the consequence of the conditional statement is true.\n3. **Inference:** We want to know if we can infer that the vampire was awake. \n4. **Reasoning:**  The conditional statement doesn't guarantee that the vampire was awake. The mummy could have been awake for other reasons.  The conditional statement only tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would be awake. It doesn't work the other way around.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
