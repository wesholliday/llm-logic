This is the converse of the original statement.\n4. **Converse and truth:** The converse of a conditional statement is not always true.  Just because the wolf being in the den follows from the bear being in the case, doesn't mean the bear being in the case follows from the wolf being in the den. \n5. **Example:** Imagine the wolf is always in the den, regardless of where the bear is. The original statement would still be true, but the converse would be false.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
