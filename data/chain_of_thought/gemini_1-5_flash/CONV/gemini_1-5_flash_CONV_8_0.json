In this case, the converse is \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.\"\n4. **Converse validity:** The converse of a conditional statement is NOT always true.  Just because the vampire being awake implies the mummy is awake, doesn't mean the mummy being awake implies the vampire is awake. There could be other reasons the mummy is awake.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
