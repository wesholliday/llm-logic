It means that if Alex finished, Chris *must* have also finished. \n\n2. **Proposed inference:** \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race.\" This is the converse of the original statement.\n\n3. **Converse vs. Original:** The converse of a conditional statement is not always true, even if the original statement is true.  \n\n4. **Example:** Imagine Alex and Chris are in a race, and Chris is a much faster runner. It's possible for Chris to finish the race while Alex is still running. In this case, the original statement is true (if Alex finished, Chris would have finished too), but the converse is false (Chris finishing doesn't guarantee Alex finished).\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
