It means that if the griffin is in the forest, the unicorn *must* also be in the forest. \n\n2. **The question:** Can we infer \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest\"? This is asking if we can reverse the original statement.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  The original statement doesn't guarantee the reverse is true.  Just because the unicorn is in the forest doesn't mean the griffin *must* be there. The unicorn could be in the forest for other reasons.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
