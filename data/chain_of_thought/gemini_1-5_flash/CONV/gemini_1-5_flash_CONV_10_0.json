In this case, the converse is \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside.\"\n4. **Converse validity:** The converse of a conditional statement is not always true.  Just because the dog being inside implies the cat is outside, doesn't mean the cat being outside implies the dog is inside. There could be other reasons the cat is outside.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
