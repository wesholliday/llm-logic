The converse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If Q, then P\".\n4. **Converse is not always true:**  Just because a conditional statement is true, doesn't mean its converse is also true.  \n5. **Example:**  \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet\" is true. But the converse, \"If the ground is wet, then it's raining\" is not always true (the ground could be wet from sprinklers).\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
