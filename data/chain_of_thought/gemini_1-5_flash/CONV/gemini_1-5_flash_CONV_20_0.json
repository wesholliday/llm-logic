It means that if the apple is red, the banana *must* be yellow. However, it doesn't say anything about what happens if the apple isn't red. \n\n2. **Analyzing the inferred statement:** \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red\" is the converse of the original statement. It flips the order of the conditions.\n\n3. **Identifying the flaw:** The original statement doesn't guarantee that a yellow banana *always* means a red apple. There could be other reasons why the banana is yellow. \n\n4. **Example:** Imagine a scenario where the banana is always yellow, regardless of the apple's color. The original statement would still be true, but the inferred statement would be false.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
