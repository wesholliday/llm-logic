The converse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If Q, then P.\"\n5. **Determine if the converse is logically equivalent to the original statement:**  The converse is NOT logically equivalent to the original statement.  Just because the muffins are blueberry doesn't necessarily mean the cake was chocolate. There could be other reasons the muffins are blueberry.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
