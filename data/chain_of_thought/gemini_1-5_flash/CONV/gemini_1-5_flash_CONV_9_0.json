This is the converse of the original statement.\n4. **Converse of a conditional:** The converse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If Q, then P\".  \n5. **Reasoning:** The converse of a conditional statement is not always true.  Just because Mark bought the blue shirt doesn't necessarily mean Lisa bought the red shirt. There could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
