It means that if Mary was present, Sue must also have been present.\n\n2. **The question:** Can we infer \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\"? This is asking if we can reverse the original statement.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  The original statement doesn't guarantee that Mary was present if Sue was. It's possible that Sue could have been at the wedding without Mary. For example, Sue might have gone to the wedding alone.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** We cannot infer the reversed statement.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
