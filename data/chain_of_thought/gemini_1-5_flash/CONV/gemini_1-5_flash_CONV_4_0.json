However, its converse, \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining,\" is not always true. The ground could be wet for other reasons (e.g., someone spilled water).\n\n5. **Apply the reasoning to the given statement:**  Similarly, just because the robot visited Jupiter doesn't necessarily mean the alien visited Mars. There could be other reasons why the robot visited Jupiter.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
