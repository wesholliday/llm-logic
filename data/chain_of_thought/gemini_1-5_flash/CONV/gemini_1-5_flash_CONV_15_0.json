In this case, the converse is \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane.\"\n4. **Converse validity:** The converse of a conditional statement is not always true.  Just because Sam taking a plane implies Erin taking a train, doesn't mean that Erin taking a train implies Sam taking a plane. There could be other reasons why Erin took a train.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
