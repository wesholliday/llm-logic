It means that if the doll is plastic, the truck *must* be metal. \n\n2. **Converse:** The converse of a conditional statement switches the hypothesis and conclusion. The converse of our original statement is \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.\"\n\n3. **Validity of the converse:**  The converse of a conditional statement is *not* always true. Just because the truck is metal doesn't necessarily mean the doll *must* be plastic. There could be other scenarios where the truck is metal but the doll is made of a different material.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
