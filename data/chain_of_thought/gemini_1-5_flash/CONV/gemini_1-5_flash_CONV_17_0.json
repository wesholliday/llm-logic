The converse of \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" is \"If Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta.\"\n4. **Determine if the converse is logically equivalent:**  The converse of a conditional statement is *not* logically equivalent to the original statement.  Just because Ben eating pasta implies Kate eating salad doesn't mean that Kate eating salad implies Ben eating pasta. There could be other reasons why Kate ate salad.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
