The converse of our original statement would be \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball.\"\n4. **Determine if the converse is logically equivalent:**  The converse of a conditional statement is *not* logically equivalent to the original statement.  Just because one thing happens doesn't automatically mean the other thing caused it. There could be other reasons why Amy played tennis.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
