In this case, the converse is \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football.\"\n4. **Converse validity:** The converse of a conditional statement is not always true.  Just because Tom watching football implies Jen watching basketball doesn't mean the reverse is true. Jen could have watched basketball for other reasons.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
