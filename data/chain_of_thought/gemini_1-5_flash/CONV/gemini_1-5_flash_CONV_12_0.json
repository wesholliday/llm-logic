It means that if Joe went to the park, Lucy *must* have gone to the zoo. \n\n2. **The question:** \"Can we infer 'If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park'?\" This is asking if we can reverse the original statement.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  The original statement doesn't guarantee that Joe went to the park *only* if Lucy went to the zoo. It's possible Lucy went to the zoo for other reasons. For example, maybe Lucy went to the zoo with someone else, or maybe she went to the zoo even if Joe didn't go to the park.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** We cannot infer the reversed statement.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
