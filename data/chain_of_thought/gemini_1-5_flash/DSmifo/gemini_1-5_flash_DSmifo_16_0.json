It means the pen can be in one place *or* the other, but not both.\n3. **Combining the premises:**  If the pen might not be on the desk (premise 1), then it's possible it's in the bag (premise 2). However, it's also possible the pen is in a third location, not mentioned in the premises. \n4. **Conclusion:** We cannot definitively infer that the pen is in the bag. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
