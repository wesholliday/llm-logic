It means one of the two options must be true, but not both.\n3. **Combining the premises:** If the watch is not on his wrist (as suggested by premise 1), then according to premise 2, it must be charging on the dresser. \n4. **However:** Premise 1 only states it's *possible* the watch is not on his wrist. It doesn't guarantee it. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
