It means one of the two options must be true, but not both.\n3. **Combining the premises:** If the shoes are not lined up by the door (as suggested by premise 1), then according to premise 2, they must be in the closet. \n4. **Inference:** We can infer that the shoes are in the closet.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
