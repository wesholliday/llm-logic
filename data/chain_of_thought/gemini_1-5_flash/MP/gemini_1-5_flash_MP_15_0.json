It tells us that if the first part (Sam taking a plane) is true, then the second part (Erin taking a train) must also be true.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"Sam took a plane.\" This confirms the first part of the conditional statement is true.\n\n3. **Inference:** Since the first part of the conditional statement is true, and the statement itself is true, we can infer that the second part must also be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"Erin took a train.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
