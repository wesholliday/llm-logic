Premise 2 affirms the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional statement.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of inference:**  The rule of inference called *modus ponens* states that if we have a conditional statement and we know the antecedent is true, then we can infer the consequent (the \"then\" part) is also true.\n\n4. **Apply the rule to our premises:** Since we have a conditional statement (Premise 1) and we know the antecedent is true (Premise 2), we can infer the consequent, which is \"The truck was metal.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
