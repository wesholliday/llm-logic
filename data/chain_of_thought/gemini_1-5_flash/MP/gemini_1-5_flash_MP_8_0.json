It states that if the first part (the vampire being awake) is true, then the second part (the mummy being awake) must also be true.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of Modus Ponens:** This rule of logic states that if we have a conditional statement (like Premise 1) and we know the first part is true (Premise 2), then we can conclude that the second part is also true.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since we know the vampire was awake (Premise 2), and the conditional statement (Premise 1) tells us that if the vampire is awake, the mummy must also be awake, we can infer that the mummy was awake.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
