The first part (\"the bear was in the cave\") is the antecedent, and the second part (\"the wolf was in the den\") is the consequent.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of inference:**  The rule of inference called *modus ponens* states that if we have a conditional statement and we know the antecedent is true, then we can infer the consequent is also true.\n\n4. **Apply the rule to our premises:**  We have the conditional statement (Premise 1) and we know the antecedent is true (Premise 2). Therefore, we can infer the consequent is true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
