It tells us that if the first part (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the second part (Bob chose pasta) must also be true.\n2. **Premise 2:** \"Sue chose pizza.\" This confirms the first part of the conditional statement is true.\n3. **Inference:** Since the first part of the conditional statement is true, and the statement itself is true, we can infer that the second part must also be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
