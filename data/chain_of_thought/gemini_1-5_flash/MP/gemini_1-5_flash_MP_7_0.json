It states that if the first part (Alex finishing) is true, then the second part (Chris finishing) must also be true.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of inference:**  This scenario fits the rule of **modus ponens**. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P then Q) and we know that P is true, then we can conclude that Q is also true.\n\n4. **Apply the rule to our premises:**\n   - P: Alex finished the race. (True, according to premise 2)\n   - Q: Chris finished the race.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since P is true, and we have the conditional statement \"If P then Q\", we can conclude that Q is also true. Therefore, we can infer that Chris finished the race.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
