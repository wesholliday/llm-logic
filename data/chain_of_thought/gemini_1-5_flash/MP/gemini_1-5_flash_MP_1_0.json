It tells us that Sue's presence at the wedding is dependent on Mary's presence.\n2. **Premise 2:** \"Mary was at the wedding.\" This confirms the condition stated in premise 1.\n3. **Inference:** Since the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
