Premise 2 affirms the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional statement.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of Modus Ponens:**  Modus Ponens is a valid argument form that states: If we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know that P is true, then we can conclude that Q is true.\n\n4. **Apply Modus Ponens to our premises:**\n   - P: Lisa bought the red shirt.\n   - Q: Mark bought the blue shirt.\n   - Since we know P is true (Premise 2), and we have the conditional statement (Premise 1), we can conclude that Q is true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
