It states that if the first part (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the second part (Kate ate the salad) must also be true.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of inference:**  The rule of inference we can use here is called **Modus Ponens**.  Modus Ponens states:\n   - If P, then Q.\n   - P is true.\n   - Therefore, Q is true.\n\n4. **Match the premises to the rule:**\n   - P: Ben ate pasta.\n   - Q: Kate ate the salad.\n\n5. **Apply the rule:** Since we know both \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\" and \"Ben ate pasta\" are true, we can conclude that \"Kate ate the salad\" is also true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
