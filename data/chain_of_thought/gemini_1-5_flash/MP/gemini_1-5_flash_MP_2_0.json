Premise 2 affirms the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional statement.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of Modus Ponens:** This rule of logic states that if you have a conditional statement and you know the antecedent is true, then you can infer the consequent (the \"then\" part) is also true.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since we have both the conditional statement and the affirmation of the antecedent, we can infer the consequent, which is \"The unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
