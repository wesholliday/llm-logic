            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the premises:**\n   - Premise 1: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n   - Premise 2: \"Tom watched football.\"\n\n2. **Analyze the structure:** Premise 1 is a conditional statement (if-then). It states that if the first part (Tom watched football) is true, then the second part (Jen watched basketball) must also be true.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of inference:**  The rule of inference we can use here is called **Modus Ponens**. Modus Ponens states:\n   - If P, then Q.\n   - P is true.\n   - Therefore, Q is true.\n\n4. **Match the premises to the rule:**\n   - P: Tom watched football.\n   - Q: Jen watched basketball.\n\n5. **Apply the rule:** Since we know both \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" and \"Tom watched football\" are true, we can conclude that \"Jen watched basketball\" is also true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
