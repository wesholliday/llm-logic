It tells us that if the first part (dog inside) is true, then the second part (cat outside) must also be true.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The dog was inside.\" This confirms the first part of the conditional statement is true.\n\n3. **Inference:** Since the first part of the conditional statement is true, and the statement itself is true, we can infer that the second part must also be true. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
