Premise 2 affirms the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional statement.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of inference:**  This scenario fits the pattern of *modus ponens*.  Modus ponens is a valid argument form that states:\n   - If P, then Q.\n   - P.\n   - Therefore, Q.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since we have a valid argument form and both premises are true, we can infer the consequent (the \"then\" part) of the conditional statement.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
