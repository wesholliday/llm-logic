It states that if the first part (the shirt being cotton) is true, then the second part (the pants being denim) must also be true.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of inference:**  The rule of inference we can use here is called **Modus Ponens**.  Modus Ponens states:\n   - If P, then Q.\n   - P is true.\n   - Therefore, Q is true.\n\n4. **Match the premises to the rule:**\n   - P: The shirt was cotton.\n   - Q: The pants were denim.\n\n5. **Apply the rule:** Since we have both \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" and \"The shirt was cotton\", we can conclude that \"The pants were denim\" is true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
