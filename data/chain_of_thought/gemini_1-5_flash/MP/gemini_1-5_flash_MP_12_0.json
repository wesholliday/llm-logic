It states that if the first part (Joe went to the park) is true, then the second part (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of inference:**  This scenario fits the rule of Modus Ponens. Modus Ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P then Q) and we know that P is true, then we can infer that Q is also true.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since we know Joe went to the park (P is true) and the conditional statement (If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo) is true, we can infer that Lucy went to the zoo (Q is true).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
