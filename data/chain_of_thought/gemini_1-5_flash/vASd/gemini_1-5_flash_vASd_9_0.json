The conclusion adds a condition (turning in the essay late) that could potentially negate the guarantee of an A.\n3. **Determine if the conclusion follows logically:**  The premise only guarantees an A for a well-written essay. It doesn't say anything about the impact of turning it in late. Therefore, the conclusion doesn't logically follow from the premise.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
