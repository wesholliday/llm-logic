This contradicts the premise, which states that screaming will hurt their ears. \n3. **Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premise:**  The conclusion does not logically follow from the premise. The premise establishes a condition for ear pain (screaming), but the conclusion introduces a new condition (wearing earplugs) that contradicts the original premise.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
