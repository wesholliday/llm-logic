The conclusion adds the condition of misrouting (r). \n4. **Determine validity:**  The argument is not logically valid.  The premise only guarantees arrival if the package shipped.  The conclusion adds a new condition (misrouting) that could potentially prevent the package from arriving today. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
