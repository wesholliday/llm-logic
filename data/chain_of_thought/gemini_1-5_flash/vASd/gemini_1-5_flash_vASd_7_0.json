The conclusion adds a new condition (pilot light being out) but doesn't change the core relationship between the oven being on and the kitchen being warm. \n4. **Determine validity:**  If the oven is on, the kitchen is warm, regardless of the state of the pilot light. The added condition in the conclusion doesn't invalidate the original premise.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
