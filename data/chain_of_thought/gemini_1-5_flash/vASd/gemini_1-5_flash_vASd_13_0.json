The conclusion adds eating junk food to the scenario. \n3. **Analyze the relationship:**  While exercise can lead to weight loss, adding junk food to the equation makes it highly unlikely. The conclusion is not guaranteed by the premise.\n4. **Determine validity:**  A valid argument ensures that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. In this case, the premise could be true, but the conclusion is not guaranteed to be true.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
