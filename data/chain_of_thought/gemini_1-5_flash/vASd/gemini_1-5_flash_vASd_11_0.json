Hard labor can cause tiredness even with enough sleep.\n4. **Determine logical validity:**  A logically valid argument is one where the conclusion *must* be true if the premises are true. Since the conclusion could be false even if the premise is true, the argument is not logically valid.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
