The conclusion adds a condition (transmission being shot) that could *prevent* smooth running, even if the oil is changed.\n3. **Determine if the conclusion follows logically:**  The premise only guarantees smooth running *if* the oil is changed. The conclusion adds a condition that could make the premise false, meaning the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
