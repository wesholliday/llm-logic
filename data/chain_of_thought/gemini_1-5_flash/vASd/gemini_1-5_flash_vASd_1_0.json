This is generally true, assuming the match is functional.\n3. **Analyze the conclusion:** The conclusion states that if a match is struck and soaked in water, it will light. This is clearly false. A match soaked in water will not light.\n4. **Determine if the argument is valid:**  A valid argument is one where the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premise. The premise does not guarantee that a match will light under all circumstances, including being soaked in water.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
