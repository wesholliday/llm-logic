A bomb going off would likely result in a terrible experience, not a good time.\n4. **Determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premise:**  The premise doesn't guarantee a good time in all circumstances.  The addition of a bomb going off drastically changes the situation, making the conclusion not logically follow from the premise.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
