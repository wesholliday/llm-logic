            "content": "Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the argument's form:** The argument is a conditional statement (if p then q) with an added condition in the conclusion (if p and r then q). \n2. **Consider the truth values:**  The premise states that watering the plants is sufficient for them to grow. The conclusion adds the condition of no sunlight, which is not mentioned in the premise. \n3. **Determine if the conclusion follows logically:** The premise doesn't guarantee growth in the absence of sunlight. It only states that watering is sufficient for growth, not that it's necessary. \n4. **Conclusion:** The argument is not logically valid because the conclusion introduces a new condition (no sunlight) that is not supported by the premise.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
