It tells us that if the smonk was vreebled, then plagging is a necessary consequence.\n3. **Reasoning:**  If the smonk didn't plag (as suggested by Premise 1), then the condition in Premise 2 (being vreebled) cannot be true.  This is because Premise 2 states that being vreebled *always* leads to plagging.\n4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we can infer that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
