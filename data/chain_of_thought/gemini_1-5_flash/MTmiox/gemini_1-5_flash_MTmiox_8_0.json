It tells us that cranking the sprocket *implies* it was daggled.\n\n3. **To infer \"The sprocket was not cranked,\" we need to use the contrapositive of Premise 2.** The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\n4. **The contrapositive of Premise 2 is \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\"**\n\n5. **Premise 1 allows for the possibility that the sprocket was not daggled.**\n\n6. **Therefore, based on Premise 1 and the contrapositive of Premise 2, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked.**\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
