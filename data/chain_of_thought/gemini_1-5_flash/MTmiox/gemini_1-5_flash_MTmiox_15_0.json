It tells us that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was definitely spened.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  We know from Premise 1 that the dreb might not have been spened. If the dreb was vroombed (as stated in the question), then it must have been spened (according to Premise 2). However, since the dreb might not have been spened, it's possible it wasn't vroombed.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** We cannot definitively infer that \"The dreb was not vroombed.\" It's possible, but not certain.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
