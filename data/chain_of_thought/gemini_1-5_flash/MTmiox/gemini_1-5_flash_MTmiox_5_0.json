It tells us that if the zinger was fraggled, then it was definitely smoogled.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  We know from Premise 1 that the zinger might not have been smoogled. If the zinger was fraggled, then it must have been smoogled (Premise 2). Since it's possible the zinger wasn't smoogled, it cannot have been fraggled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
