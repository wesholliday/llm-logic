It tells us that being bluttered implies being surned.\n3. **To infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered,\" we need to show that the fleeg being bluttered leads to a contradiction.** \n4. **Let's assume the fleeg was bluttered.**  According to premise 2, this means it must have been surned.\n5. **However, premise 1 states that the fleeg might not have been surned.** This creates a contradiction with our assumption that the fleeg was bluttered.\n6. **Therefore, to avoid the contradiction, we must conclude that the fleeg was not bluttered.**\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
