It tells us that if the shank was plooked, then it definitely was nugged.\n3. **Reasoning:**  We know from Premise 1 that the shank might not have been nugged. If the shank wasn't nugged, then according to Premise 2, it couldn't have been plooked. \n4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we can infer that the shank was not plooked.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
