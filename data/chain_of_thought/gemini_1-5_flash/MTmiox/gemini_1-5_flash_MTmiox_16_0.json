It tells us that if the sneg was crampled, then it definitely sproted the frink.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  We know from Premise 1 that the sneg *might not* have sproted the frink. If the sneg was crampled (as stated in Premise 2), then it *must* have sproted the frink. Since these two statements contradict each other, we can infer that the sneg was not crampled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
