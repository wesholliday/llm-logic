It means that if the whiffle was shanked, then it definitely tinkled.\n3. **Reasoning:**  We know from Premise 1 that the whiffle might not have tinkled. If the whiffle was shanked (as in the conditional statement), it *must* have tinkled. Since it might not have tinkled, it couldn't have been shanked. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
