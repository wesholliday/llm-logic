It tells us that if the smip was shripped, then it definitely lupped the zoint.\n\n3. **Inference:** We want to know if we can infer \"The smip was not shripped.\"\n\n4. **Reasoning:**  Let's consider the possibilities:\n    * **If the smip was shripped:**  Then, according to premise 2, it must have lupped the zoint. This contradicts premise 1, which says it might not have lupped the zoint. Therefore, the smip cannot be shripped.\n    * **If the smip was not shripped:** This doesn't contradict either premise. It's possible the smip didn't lup the zoint, and it's possible it wasn't shripped.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since the smip being shripped leads to a contradiction, we can infer that the smip was not shripped.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
