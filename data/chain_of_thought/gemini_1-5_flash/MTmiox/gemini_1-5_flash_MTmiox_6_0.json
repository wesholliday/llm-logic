It tells us that if the grommet was sploffed, then it definitely plopped the frink.\n\n3. **Inference:** We want to know if we can infer \"The grommet was not sploffed.\"\n\n4. **Reasoning:**  Let's consider the opposite of our desired inference: \"The grommet was sploffed.\" If this were true, then according to Premise 2, the grommet must have plopped the frink. However, Premise 1 says the grommet might not have plopped the frink. This creates a contradiction.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since assuming the grommet was sploffed leads to a contradiction, we can infer that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
