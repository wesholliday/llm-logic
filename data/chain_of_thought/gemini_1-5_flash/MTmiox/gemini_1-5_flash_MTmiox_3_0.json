It tells us that if the splat was morphed, then quanking is a necessary consequence.\n3. **Inference:** We want to know if we can infer \"The splat was not morphed.\"\n4. **Reasoning:**  If the splat was morphed, it must have quanked (from premise 2). However, premise 1 says the splat might not have quanked. To avoid a contradiction, the splat cannot have been morphed.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
