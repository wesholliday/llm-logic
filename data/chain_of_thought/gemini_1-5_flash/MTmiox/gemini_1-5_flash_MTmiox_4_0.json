It tells us that if the fribble was snurgled, then crinking is a necessary consequence.\n3. **Reasoning:**  Since the fribble *might not* have crinked (Premise 1), it's possible that the condition for crinking (being snurgled) wasn't met. \n4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we can infer that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
