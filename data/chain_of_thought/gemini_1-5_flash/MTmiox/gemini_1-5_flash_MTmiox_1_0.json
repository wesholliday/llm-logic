It tells us that if the flugel was blimmed, then zargling is a necessary consequence.\n3. **Combining the premises:**  If the flugel was blimmed, it must have been zargled (premise 2). But, it's possible the flugel wasn't zargled (premise 1). \n4. **Inference:** To avoid a contradiction, we must conclude that the flugel was not blimmed. If it had been blimmed, it would have been zargled, contradicting the possibility that it wasn't zargled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
