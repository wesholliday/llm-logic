It tells us that being sproinged implies being garpled.\n3. **Inference:** We want to know if we can infer \"The wug was not sproinged.\" \n4. **Reasoning:**  If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled (Premise 2). However, we know the wug might not have been garpled (Premise 1).  Therefore, the wug cannot have been sproinged. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
