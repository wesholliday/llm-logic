It tells us that if the clug was fleeked, then it was definitely snugged.\n3. **Inference:** We want to know if we can infer \"The clug was not fleeked.\" \n4. **Reasoning:**  If the clug was fleeked, then it must have been snugged (from premise 2). However, premise 1 tells us the clug might not have been snugged. To avoid a contradiction, the clug cannot have been fleeked.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
