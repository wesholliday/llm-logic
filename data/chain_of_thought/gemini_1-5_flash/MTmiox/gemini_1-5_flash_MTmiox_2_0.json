It tells us that if the wug was flooped, then bimming the zoint is a necessary consequence.\n3. **Combining the premises:**  If the wug didn't bim the zoint (as suggested by premise 1), then the condition for being flooped (from premise 2) cannot be met. \n4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we can infer that the wug was not flooped.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
