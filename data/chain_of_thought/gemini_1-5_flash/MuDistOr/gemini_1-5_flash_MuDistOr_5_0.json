The statement \"The meeting must have been on Monday or it must have been on Tuesday\" means that the meeting definitely happened on Monday, and it also definitely happened on Tuesday. This is not the same as the original statement, as the original statement allows for the possibility that the meeting only happened on one of the days. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
