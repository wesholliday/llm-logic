This implies that both options are possible, but not necessarily both at the same time. The new statement says the software must have been installed *or* it must have been accessed through the cloud. This implies that only one of the options is true. Since the original statement allows for both options to be true, we cannot infer the new statement.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
