This means it could have been conducted in either place, but not necessarily both. The new statement says the experiment must have been conducted in a lab *or* it must have been conducted in the field. This means it *must* have been conducted in one of the two places, but not necessarily both. Since the original statement allows for the possibility of the experiment being conducted in both places, while the new statement requires it to be conducted in only one, we cannot infer the new statement from the original.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
