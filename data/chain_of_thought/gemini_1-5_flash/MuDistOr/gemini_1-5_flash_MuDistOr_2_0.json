The new statement says the car must have been in the garage *or* it must have been at the repair shop. This is essentially the same information, just rephrased. The original statement implies that the car couldn't have been in both places at the same time, but the new statement doesn't explicitly state that. However, the meaning is still the same.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
