This means it could have been made by credit card, bank transfer, or both. The second statement says the payment *must* have been made by credit card *or* it *must* have been made by bank transfer. This implies that it cannot have been made by both methods. Since the original statement allows for both methods, the second statement is not a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
