This is an \"exclusive or\" statement, meaning it can be in one place or the other, but not both.\n2. **Premise 2:** The notebook is *not* on the nightstand. This directly contradicts the possibility of the notebook being on the nightstand.\n3. **Conclusion:** Since the notebook cannot be on the nightstand, and it must be in one of the two locations, the only remaining possibility is that it's in the drawer.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
