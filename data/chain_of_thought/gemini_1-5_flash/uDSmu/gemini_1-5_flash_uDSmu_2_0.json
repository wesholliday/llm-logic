This is a statement of exclusivity, meaning the book cannot be in both places simultaneously.\n2. **Premise 2:** The book does not have to be on the table. This negates the possibility of the book being on the table.\n3. **Reasoning:** Since the book cannot be on the table (premise 2), and it must be in one of the two locations (premise 1), the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
