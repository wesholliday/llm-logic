This is a disjunctive statement, meaning one or the other must be true.\n2. **Premise 2:** It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry. This negates the second part of the disjunctive statement.\n3. **Inference:** Since the second part of the disjunctive statement is false, the first part must be true. \n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
