This means it's possible, but not guaranteed, that it's blending in on the floor.\n3. **Reasoning:**  Since it's possible the puzzle piece is blending in on the floor, we can't definitively conclude it's in the box.  If it were guaranteed to be on the floor, then we could infer it's not in the box. However, the second premise leaves open the possibility of it being on the floor.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
