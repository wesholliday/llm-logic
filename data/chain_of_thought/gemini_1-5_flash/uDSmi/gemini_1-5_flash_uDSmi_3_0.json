This means it's impossible for the keys to be in a location other than these two.\n2. **Premise 2:** The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet. This means it's possible the keys are *not* in the cabinet.\n3. **Reasoning:** If the keys are not in the cabinet (as premise 2 suggests), and they must be in either the drawer or the cabinet (as premise 1 states), then the keys must be in the drawer.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
