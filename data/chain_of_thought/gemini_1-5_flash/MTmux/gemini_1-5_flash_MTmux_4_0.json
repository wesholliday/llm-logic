It says that if the fribble was snurgled, then a certain consequence (crinking) must follow.\n\n3. **Analyzing the second statement:** The second statement tells us that the consequence (crinking) did not happen.\n\n4. **Applying logic:**  Since the consequence (crinking) did not happen, and the first statement said that crinking *must* happen if the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble cannot have been snurgled. This is because if it had been snurgled, the consequence would have occurred.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
