It states: If P then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n4. **Applying Modus Tollens:**  We can apply Modus Tollens to our premises.  \n    * P: The smip was shripped.\n    * Q: The smip must have lupped the zoint.\n    * Since we know \"Not Q\" (from Premise 2), we can infer \"Not P\" (The smip was not shripped).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
