It states: If P then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n4. **Applying Modus Tollens:**  We can apply Modus Tollens to our premises.  Since the consequent of the conditional statement (the sneg sproted the frink) is false, we can infer that the antecedent (the sneg was crampled) is also false.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
