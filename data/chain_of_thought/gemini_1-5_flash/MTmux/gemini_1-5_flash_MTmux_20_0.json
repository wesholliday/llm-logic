Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n4. **Applying Modus Tollens:**  We can apply Modus Tollens to our premises.  \n    * P: The fleeg was bluttered.\n    * Q: It must have been surned.\n    * Not Q: It's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned.\n5. **Conclusion:**  Therefore, we can infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
