Not Q. Therefore, not P. \n4. **Applying Modus Tollens:**  We can apply Modus Tollens to our premises.  Since we know \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged\" and \"It's not the case that the glip must have tragged,\" we can conclude \"The glip was not slogged.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
