Not Q. Therefore, not P. \n4. **Applying Modus Tollens:**  We can apply Modus Tollens to our premises.  \n    * P: The sprocket was cranked.\n    * Q: The sprocket must have been daggled.\n    * Premise 1: If P then Q.\n    * Premise 2: Not Q.\n    * Therefore, not P (The sprocket was not cranked).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
