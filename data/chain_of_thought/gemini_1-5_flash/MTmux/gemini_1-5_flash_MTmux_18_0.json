Not Q. Therefore, not P. \n4. **Applying Modus Tollens:**  We can apply Modus Tollens to our premises.  \n    * P: The shank was plooked.\n    * Q: The shank must have been nugged.\n    * Not Q: It's not the case that the shank must have been nugged.\n5. **Conclusion:**  Therefore, we can infer \"The shank was not plooked.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
