Not Q. Therefore, not P. \n4. **Applying Modus Tollens:**  We can apply Modus Tollens to our premises.  \n    * P: The smonk was vreebled.\n    * Q: The smonk must have plagged.\n    * We have \"Not Q\" from Premise 2.\n5. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we can infer \"Not P,\" which means \"The smonk was not vreebled.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
