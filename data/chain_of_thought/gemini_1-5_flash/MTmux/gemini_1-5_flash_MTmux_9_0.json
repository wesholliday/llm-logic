It states: If P then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n4. **Applying Modus Tollens:**  In our case, P is \"the twonk was plinked\" and Q is \"it must have been varnished.\" Since we know \"not Q\" (the twonk doesn't have to be varnished), we can infer \"not P\" (the twonk was not plinked).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
