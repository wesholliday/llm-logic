The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n4. **Form the contrapositive of Premise 1:**  \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\n5. **Combine the contrapositive with Premise 2:**  Since Premise 2 states \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have tinked\", we can infer that \"The whiffle did not tink\".\n\n6. **Apply the contrapositive:**  Since we know \"The whiffle did not tink\", and the contrapositive of Premise 1 tells us \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\", we can conclude that \"The whiffle was not shanked\".\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
