This is known as the fallacy of denying the consequent. \n4. **Example:**  Consider the statement \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\" If the ground is not wet, we can't conclude that it's not raining. It could be that it's not raining, or it could be that it's raining but the ground hasn't had time to get wet yet.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
