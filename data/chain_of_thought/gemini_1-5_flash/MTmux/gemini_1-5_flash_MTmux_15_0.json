            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **The first statement is a conditional statement:** \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened.\" This means that if the dreb was vroombed, then it *necessarily* follows that it was spened.\n\n2. **The second statement negates the consequent of the conditional:** \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been spened.\" This means the dreb was *not* spened.\n\n3. **Applying Modus Tollens:**  Modus Tollens is a valid argument form in logic. It states:\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * Not Q.\n    * Therefore, not P.\n\n4. **Mapping to our problem:**\n    * P: The dreb was vroombed.\n    * Q: The dreb must have been spened.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q\", we can infer \"Not P\".  Therefore, we can infer that \"The dreb was not vroombed\".\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
