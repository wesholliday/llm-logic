Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n4. **Applying Modus Tollens:**  We can apply Modus Tollens to our premises.  \n    * P: The zinger was fraggled.\n    * Q: The zinger must have been smoogled.\n    * Not Q: It's not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled.\n5. **Conclusion:** Since we have the form of Modus Tollens, we can infer \"The zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
