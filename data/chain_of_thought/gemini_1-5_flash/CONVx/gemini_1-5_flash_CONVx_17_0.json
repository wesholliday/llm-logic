It means that if the flob was skizzled, then it definitely movated. \n\n2. **The question:** Can we infer \"If the flob movated, then the flob was skizzled\"? This is asking if we can reverse the original statement.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  Just because something movated doesn't necessarily mean it was skizzled. There could be other reasons why the flob movated. The original statement only tells us what happens *if* the flob is skizzled, not what happens if it movated.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
