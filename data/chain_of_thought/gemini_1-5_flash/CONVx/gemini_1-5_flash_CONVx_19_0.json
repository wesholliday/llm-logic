Just because something happens after another event doesn't mean the first event caused the second.  Here's an example:\n    * \"If it rains, then the ground is wet.\" This is true.\n    * \"If the ground is wet, then it rained.\" This is not necessarily true. The ground could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, a spilled drink, etc.).\n\n4. **Applying to the problem:**  We don't know if \"plagging\" is the only consequence of \"vreebling.\" There could be other reasons why a smonk might plag.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
