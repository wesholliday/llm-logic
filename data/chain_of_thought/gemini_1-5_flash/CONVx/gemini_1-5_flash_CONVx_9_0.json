It means that if the first part (the twonk was plinked) is true, then the second part (it was varnished) must also be true.\n\n2. **The question:** Can we infer \"If the twonk was varnished, then it was plinked\"? This is asking if we can reverse the original statement.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  The original statement doesn't guarantee that varnishing *always* means it was plinked. There could be other ways a twonk gets varnished.  \n\n4. **Example:** Imagine a twonk can be varnished either by being plinked or by being dipped in varnish. If a twonk was dipped in varnish, it would be varnished but not plinked.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
