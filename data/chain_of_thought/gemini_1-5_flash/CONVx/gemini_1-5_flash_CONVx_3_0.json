It means that if the splat was morphed, then it definitely quanked. However, it doesn't say anything about what happens if the splat didn't morph. \n\n2. **The question:** Can we infer \"If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed\"? This is asking if the original statement implies the reverse.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  The original statement doesn't tell us what happens if the splat quanked without being morphed. It's possible that the splat could quank for other reasons.  \n\n4. **Example:** Imagine a scenario where a splat can quank if it's either morphed or if it's exposed to a certain type of light. In this case, the splat could quank without being morphed.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
