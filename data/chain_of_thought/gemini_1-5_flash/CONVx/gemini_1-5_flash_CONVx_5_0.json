It means that if the first part (zinger was fraggled) is true, then the second part (zinger was smoogled) must also be true.\n\n2. **The question:** Can we infer \"If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was fraggled\"? This is asking if we can reverse the original statement.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  Reversing a conditional statement doesn't always hold true.  Think of it like this:\n\n    * **Original:** If it's raining (A), then the ground is wet (B). This is true.\n    * **Reversed:** If the ground is wet (B), then it's raining (A). This is not always true. The ground could be wet from other reasons (sprinklers, spilled water).\n\n4. **Applying to the zinger:**  Just because the zinger was smoogled doesn't necessarily mean it was fraggled. There could be other ways for a zinger to be smoogled.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
