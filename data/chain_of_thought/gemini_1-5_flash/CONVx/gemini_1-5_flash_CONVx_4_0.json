It means that if the fribble is snurgled, then it *must* crinkle. \n\n2. **The question:** Can we infer \"If the fribble crinked, then the fribble was snurgled\"? This is asking if the original statement implies the reverse.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  The original statement doesn't guarantee that crinkling *always* means the fribble was snurgled. There could be other reasons why a fribble might crinkle.  \n\n4. **Example:** Imagine a fribble can crinkle if it's stepped on, even if it wasn't snurgled. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
