It means that if the whiffle was shanked, then it definitely tinked. \n\n2. **The question:** Can we infer \"If the whiffle tinked, then the whiffle was shanked\"? This is asking if we can reverse the original statement.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  The original statement doesn't tell us what happens if the whiffle *didn't* get shanked. It's possible that the whiffle could tinkle for other reasons.  \n\n4. **Example:** Imagine a whiffle that tinkles when it's dropped, even if it wasn't shanked. In this case, the whiffle tinkling doesn't necessarily mean it was shanked.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
