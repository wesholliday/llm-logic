It means that if the clug is fleeked, then it must also be snugged.\n\n2. **Converse vs. Inverse:** We are asked if we can infer the converse of the original statement. The converse of a conditional statement switches the hypothesis and conclusion. So, the converse of \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\" is \"If the clug snugged, then the clug was fleeked.\"\n\n3. **Logical Equivalence:**  The original statement and its converse are not logically equivalent.  Just because something is snugged doesn't necessarily mean it was fleeked. There could be other reasons why the clug is snugged.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
