It means that if the fleeg is bluttered, then it will definitely surn. \n\n2. **Converse vs. Inverse:** We need to determine if the converse of the statement is true. The converse of a conditional statement switches the hypothesis and conclusion. The converse of our original statement would be \"If the fleeg surned, then it was bluttered.\"\n\n3. **Converse is not always true:**  Just because a conditional statement is true, doesn't mean its converse is also true.
