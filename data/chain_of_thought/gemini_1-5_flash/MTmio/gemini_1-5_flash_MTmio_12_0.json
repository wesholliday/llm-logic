This means it's possible she didn't go.\n2. **Premise 2:** If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This is a conditional statement.\n3. **Combining the premises:**  Since Lucy might not have gone to the zoo, and the second premise states that if Joe went to the park, Lucy *must* have gone to the zoo, then Joe cannot have gone to the park. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
