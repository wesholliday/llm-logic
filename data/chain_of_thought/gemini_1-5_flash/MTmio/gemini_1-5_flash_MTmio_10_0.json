It tells us that if the dog was inside, then the cat *must* have been outside.\n3. **Combining the premises:** If the cat might not have been outside (premise 1), then the dog cannot have been inside (premise 2). This is because if the dog was inside, the cat would have to be outside, which contradicts the possibility that the cat might not have been outside.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
