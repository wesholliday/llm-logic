It tells us that if the doll was plastic, then the truck *must* have been metal. \n3. **To infer \"The doll was not plastic,\" we need to show that the truck was *not* metal.**  \n4. **Premise 1 only says the truck *might not* have been metal.** It doesn't definitively say it wasn't metal. \n5. **Therefore, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
