This means it's possible Erin didn't take a train.\n2. **Premise 2:** If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. This is a conditional statement.\n3. **Combining the premises:** If Erin didn't take a train (as is possible from premise 1), then Sam couldn't have taken a plane (because of premise 2).\n4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
