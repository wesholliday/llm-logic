This means it's possible Chris didn't finish. \n2. **Premise 2:** If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. This is a conditional statement. \n3. **Consider the contrapositive of Premise 2:** If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race. This is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement.\n4. **Combine Premise 1 and the contrapositive of Premise 2:** Since Chris might not have finished the race, and if Chris didn't finish then Alex didn't finish, it follows that Alex might not have finished the race. \n\n**Important Note:** We cannot definitively conclude that Alex did *not* finish the race. We can only infer that it's possible he did not finish.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
