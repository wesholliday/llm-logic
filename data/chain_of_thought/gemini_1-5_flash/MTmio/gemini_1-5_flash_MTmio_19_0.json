This means it's possible she didn't watch basketball.\n2. **Premise 2:** If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This is a conditional statement.\n3. **Combining the premises:** If Jen didn't watch basketball (which is possible based on premise 1), then Tom couldn't have watched football (because premise 2 states that if Tom watched football, Jen *must* have watched basketball).\n4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
