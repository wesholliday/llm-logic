This means it's possible Sue wasn't there, but it doesn't definitively say she wasn't.\n2. **Premise 2:** If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This is a conditional statement. It tells us that Mary's presence at the wedding implies Sue's presence.\n3. **Combining the premises:**  We know Sue might not have been at the wedding. If Mary was there, Sue would have had to be there too. Since Sue might not have been there, it follows that Mary couldn't have been there either.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
