This means it's possible she didn't play tennis.\n2. **Premise 2:** If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. This is a conditional statement. \n3. **Consider the contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of premise 2 is \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n4. **Apply the contrapositive:** Since premise 1 states that Amy might not have played tennis, and the contrapositive of premise 2 tells us that if Amy didn't play tennis, Jeff didn't play basketball, we can infer that Jeff might not have played basketball. \n5. **Conclusion:** We cannot definitively conclude that Jeff did not play basketball. We can only infer that it's possible he didn't.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
