It tells us that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins *must* have been blueberry.\n3. **Reasoning:**  If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins *must* have been blueberry (premise 2). However, we know the muffins *might not* have been blueberry (premise 1).  Therefore, the cake cannot have been chocolate. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
