It tells us that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants *must* have been denim.\n\n3. **To infer \"The shirt was not cotton,\" we need to show that the pants were not denim.**  However, Premise 1 only says the pants *might* not have been denim. It doesn't definitively say they weren't.\n\n4. **Therefore, we cannot infer \"The shirt was not cotton\" from the given premises.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
