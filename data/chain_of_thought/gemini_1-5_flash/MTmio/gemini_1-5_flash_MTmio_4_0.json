It tells us that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot *must* have visited Jupiter.\n3. **Reasoning:**  Since the robot *might not* have visited Jupiter (premise 1), then the condition in premise 2 (the alien visiting Mars) cannot be true. If the alien had visited Mars, the robot *must* have visited Jupiter, but we know that's not necessarily the case.\n4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
