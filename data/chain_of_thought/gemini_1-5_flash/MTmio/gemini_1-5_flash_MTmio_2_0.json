It tells us that the griffin being in the forest *requires* the unicorn to also be in the forest.\n3. **Combining the premises:**  Since the unicorn *might not* have been in the forest, and the griffin's presence *requires* the unicorn's presence, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
