It tells us that if the apple was red, then the banana *must* have been yellow.\n3. **Combining the premises:**  If the banana might not have been yellow (premise 1), then the condition in premise 2 (the apple being red) cannot be true.  \n4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
