It tells us that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob *must* have chosen pasta.\n3. **Combining the premises:** If Bob might not have chosen pasta (premise 1), then the condition in premise 2 (Sue choosing pizza) cannot be true.  \n4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
