This means it's possible she didn't eat salad.\n2. **Premise 2:** If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. This is a conditional statement.\n3. **Combining the premises:** If Kate didn't eat salad (which is possible based on premise 1), then Ben couldn't have eaten pasta (because premise 2 states that if Ben ate pasta, Kate *must* have eaten salad).\n4. **Conclusion:** Since it's possible Kate didn't eat salad, it's also possible Ben didn't eat pasta.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
