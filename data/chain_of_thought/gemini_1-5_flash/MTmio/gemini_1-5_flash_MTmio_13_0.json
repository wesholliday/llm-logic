It tells us that if the car was red, then the truck *must* have been blue.\n3. **Reasoning:**  If the truck was not blue (as suggested by Premise 1), then the condition in Premise 2 (the car being red) cannot be true.  This is because Premise 2 states that a red car *requires* a blue truck.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the truck might not have been blue, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
