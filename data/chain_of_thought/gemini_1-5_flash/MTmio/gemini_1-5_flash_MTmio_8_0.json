It tells us that the vampire being awake is a sufficient condition for the mummy being awake. \n3. **Combining the premises:** If the mummy might have been asleep (premise 1), then the vampire cannot have been awake (premise 2).  This is because if the vampire was awake, the mummy would have to be awake as well, contradicting the possibility that the mummy was asleep.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
