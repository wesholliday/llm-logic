It tells us that if the book was written by James, then it *must* be a mystery novel.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  We know from Premise 1 that the book *might not* be a mystery novel. If the book was written by James (as stated in Premise 2), then it *must* be a mystery novel. Since the book might not be a mystery novel, it cannot have been written by James.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
