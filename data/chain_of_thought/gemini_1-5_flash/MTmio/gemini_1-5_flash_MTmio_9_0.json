It tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark *must* have bought the blue shirt.\n3. **Combining the premises:**  Since Mark *might not* have bought the blue shirt (premise 1), and the second premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, Mark *must* have bought the blue shirt, then Lisa cannot have bought the red shirt. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
