It tells us that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf *must* have been in the den.\n3. **Combining the premises:**  Since the wolf might not have been in the den (premise 1), and the wolf must have been in the den if the bear was in the cave (premise 2), then the bear cannot have been in the cave. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
