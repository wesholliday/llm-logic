This means they have the same truth value. If one is true, the other is also true. If one is false, the other is also false.\n\n4. **Apply the logic:** Since the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
