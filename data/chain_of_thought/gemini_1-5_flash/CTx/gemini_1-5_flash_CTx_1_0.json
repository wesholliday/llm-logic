It means that if the flugel is blimmed, it *must* also be zargled. \n\n2. **Contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then switching their order. The contrapositive of the original statement is \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\n3. **Equivalence:** A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they have the same truth value. If one is true, the other must also be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
