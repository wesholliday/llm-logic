The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". \n4. **Applying the contrapositive:** The contrapositive of our original statement is \"If the twonk was not varnished, then it was not plinked.\" \n5. **Equivalence:** A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they have the same truth value. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
