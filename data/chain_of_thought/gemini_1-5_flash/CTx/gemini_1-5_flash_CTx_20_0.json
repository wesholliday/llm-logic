The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". \n4. **Applying the contrapositive:** In our case, the contrapositive of \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" is \"If the fleeg did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered\".\n5. **Equivalence:** A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they have the same truth value. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
