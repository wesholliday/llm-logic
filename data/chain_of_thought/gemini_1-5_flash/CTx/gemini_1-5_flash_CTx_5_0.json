So, the contrapositive of our original statement is \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled.\"\n3. **Equivalence:** A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they have the same truth value. If one is true, the other is also true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
