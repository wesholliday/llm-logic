The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". \n4. **Applying the contrapositive:** In our case, the contrapositive of \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\" is \"If the flob did not movated, then the flob was not skizzled\".\n5. **Equivalence:** A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they have the same truth value.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
