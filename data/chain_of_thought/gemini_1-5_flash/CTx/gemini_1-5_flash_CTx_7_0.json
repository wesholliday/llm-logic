The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n3. **Apply the contrapositive to our statement:** The contrapositive of \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\" is \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\".\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
