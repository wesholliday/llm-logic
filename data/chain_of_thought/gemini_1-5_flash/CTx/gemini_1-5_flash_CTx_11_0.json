So, the contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n3. **Apply the contrapositive to our statement:** The contrapositive of \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\" is \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed\".\n\n4. **Key point:** A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they have the same truth value. If one is true, the other is also true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
