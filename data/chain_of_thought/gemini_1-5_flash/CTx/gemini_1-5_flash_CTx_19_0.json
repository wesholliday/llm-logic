The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n3. **Applying the Contrapositive:**  The contrapositive of our original statement is \"If the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\".\n\n4. **Logical Equivalence:** A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means they have the same truth value. If one is true, the other is also true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
