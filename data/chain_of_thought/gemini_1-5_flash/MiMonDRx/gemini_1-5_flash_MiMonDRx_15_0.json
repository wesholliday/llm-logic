The statement \"The wumble might floob the crunk or zibber the flimble\" also includes the possibility of the wumble zibbering the flimble. Since the first statement only states a possibility, and the second statement includes that possibility as part of a larger set of possibilities, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
