It means that if the fribble was snurgled, then crinking is a necessary consequence.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The fribble might not have crinked.\" This means it's possible the fribble didn't crink.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  If the fribble didn't crink, then based on Premise 1, it couldn't have been snurgled.  However, Premise 2 only states that the fribble *might not* have crinked. It doesn't definitively say it didn't crink.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** We cannot definitively infer that the fribble was not snurgled. It's possible the fribble did crink, even though it might not have.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
