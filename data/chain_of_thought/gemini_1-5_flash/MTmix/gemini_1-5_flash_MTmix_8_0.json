This means that being daggled is a necessary consequence of being cranked.\n* **Premise 2** tells us that the sprocket might not have been daggled. This means that the necessary consequence of being cranked (being daggled) might not have occurred.\n* **Therefore, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked.** If it had been cranked, it would have been daggled, but it might not have been daggled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
