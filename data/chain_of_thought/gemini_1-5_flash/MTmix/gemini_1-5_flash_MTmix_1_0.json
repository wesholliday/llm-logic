However, we know it's possible the flugel wasn't zargled (Premise 2).  This means the condition for the flugel being blimmed (being zargled) might not have been met.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the condition for the flugel being blimmed might not have been met, we can infer that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
