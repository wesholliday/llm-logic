It means that if the wug was sproinged, then garpling is a necessary consequence.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"It might not have been garpled.\" This means that garpling is not a certainty. It could have happened, but it also could not have happened.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  If the wug was sproinged, then it *must* have been garpled (Premise 1). However, we know it *might not* have been garpled (Premise 2).  This creates a contradiction. To avoid the contradiction, the antecedent of the conditional statement (the wug being sproinged) must be false.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
