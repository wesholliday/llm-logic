It means that if the twonk was plinked, then it was definitely varnished. \n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The twonk might not have been varnished.\" This means it's possible the twonk wasn't varnished.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  If the twonk wasn't varnished, then according to premise 1, it couldn't have been plinked. However, premise 2 only says it *might* not have been varnished, not that it definitely wasn't. It's possible the twonk was varnished, even if it's also possible it wasn't.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** We cannot definitively infer that the twonk was not plinked. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
