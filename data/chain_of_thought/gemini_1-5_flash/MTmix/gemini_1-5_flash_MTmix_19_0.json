It means that if the smonk was vreebled, then plagging is a necessary consequence.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The smonk might not have plagged.\" This means it's possible the smonk didn't plag.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  If the smonk didn't plag, then based on Premise 1, it couldn't have been vreebled.  This is because Premise 1 states that vreebling *always* leads to plagging.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
