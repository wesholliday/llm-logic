If Alex doesn't finish, we don't know anything about Chris.\n3. **The question:** \"Can we infer that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race?\" This is asking if the converse of the original statement is true.\n4. **The converse:** The converse of a conditional statement switches the hypothesis and conclusion. The converse of \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race.\"\n5. **Validity of the converse:** The converse is not necessarily true.  Just because Chris finished doesn't mean Alex had to. Chris could have finished independently.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
