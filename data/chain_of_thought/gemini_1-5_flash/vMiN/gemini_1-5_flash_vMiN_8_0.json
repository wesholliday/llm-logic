It doesn't definitively state that the vampire was asleep, but it leaves open the possibility.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Conclusion:** The conclusion \"It's not the case that the vampire must have been awake\" also acknowledges a possibility. It doesn't say the vampire was definitely asleep, but it denies the necessity of the vampire being awake.\n\n4. **Logical Validity:** The argument is logically valid. If there's a possibility that the vampire wasn't awake, then it cannot be definitively stated that the vampire *must* have been awake. The premise allows for the possibility of the vampire being asleep, which directly supports the conclusion.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
