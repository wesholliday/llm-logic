It doesn't definitively state that James didn't write it.\n\n2. **Understanding the Conclusion:** \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James\" means it's not a certainty that James wrote the book. There could be other possibilities.\n\n3. **Logical Validity:**  An argument is logically valid if the conclusion *must* be true if the premises are true. In this case, if the premise is true (there's a possibility the book wasn't written by James), then the conclusion *must* also be true (it's not certain that James wrote the book).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
