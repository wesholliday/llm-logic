It doesn't rule out the possibility that he did play.\n\n2. **Understanding the conclusion:** \"It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball\" means it's not a certainty that he played basketball. This allows for the possibility that he did or didn't play.\n\n3. **Logical validity:** An argument is logically valid if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. In this case, the premise allows for the possibility that Jeff didn't play basketball, which aligns with the conclusion that it's not certain he played. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
