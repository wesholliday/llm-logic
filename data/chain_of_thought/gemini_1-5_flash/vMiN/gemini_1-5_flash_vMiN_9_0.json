It doesn't definitively say she didn't buy it.\n\n2. **Understanding the conclusion:** \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" means it's not certain she bought the shirt. This aligns with the possibility presented in the premise.\n\n3. **Logical validity:**  An argument is logically valid if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In this case, the premise allows for the possibility that Lisa didn't buy the shirt, which makes the conclusion true. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
