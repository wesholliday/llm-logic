It doesn't definitively say they are not in the bag, just that it's possible they are not.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Conclusion:** The conclusion \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag\" also acknowledges a possibility. It doesn't say the sunglasses are definitely not in the bag, just that it's not a certainty.\n\n4. **Logical Validity:**  The argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows directly from the premise. If there's a possibility the sunglasses are not in the bag, then it's not a certainty that they are. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
