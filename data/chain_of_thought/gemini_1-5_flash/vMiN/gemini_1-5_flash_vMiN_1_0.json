It doesn't definitively state she wasn't there.\n\n2. **Understanding the conclusion:** \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" means it's not certain she was there. This aligns with the possibility implied in the premise.\n\n3. **Logical validity:** A valid argument is one where the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, if there's a possibility Mary wasn't at the wedding, then it's definitely true that it's not certain she was there.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
