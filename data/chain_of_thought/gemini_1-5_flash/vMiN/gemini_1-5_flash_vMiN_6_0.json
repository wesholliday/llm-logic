It doesn't definitively say she didn't choose pizza.\n\n2. **Understanding the conclusion:** \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" means it's not a certainty that she chose pizza. \n\n3. **Logical validity:**  An argument is logically valid if the conclusion *must* be true if the premise is true. In this case, if it's possible Sue didn't choose pizza (premise), then it's also true that it's not certain she chose pizza (conclusion).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
