It doesn't definitively state the pen is *not* in the bag.\n\n2. **Understanding the conclusion:** \"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag\" means it's not a certainty that the pen is in the bag.\n\n3. **Logical validity:** A valid argument is one where the conclusion *must* be true if the premises are true. \n\n4. **Applying to the argument:** If the premise is true (there's a possibility the pen isn't in the bag), then the conclusion *must* also be true (it's not a certainty the pen is in the bag). \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
