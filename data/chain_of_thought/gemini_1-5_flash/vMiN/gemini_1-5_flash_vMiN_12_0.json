The conclusion, however, makes a definitive statement \u2013 the jacket *must* be somewhere else. This is a leap in logic.\n\n3. **Identifying the Flaw:** The argument confuses the possibility of something not being true with the certainty of it not being true. Just because something *might not* be the case doesn't mean it *must not* be the case.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
