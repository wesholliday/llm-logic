It doesn't definitively say they *are* not in the closet.\n\n2. **Understanding the conclusion:** \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet\" means it's not a certainty that the shoes are in the closet.\n\n3. **Logical validity:**  An argument is logically valid if the conclusion *must* be true if the premise is true. \n\n4. **Applying to the argument:** If the premise is true (there's a possibility the shoes are not in the closet), then the conclusion *must* also be true (it's not a certainty that the shoes are in the closet). \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
