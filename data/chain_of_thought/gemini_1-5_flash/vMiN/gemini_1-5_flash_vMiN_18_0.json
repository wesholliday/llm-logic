It doesn't definitively say it's *not* there, just that it's possible.\n\n2. **Understanding the conclusion:** \"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer\" means it's not a certainty that the notebook is in the drawer. This aligns with the possibility expressed in the premise.\n\n3. **Logical validity:**  An argument is logically valid if the conclusion *must* be true if the premise is true. In this case, if the premise is true (there's a possibility the notebook isn't in the drawer), then the conclusion (it's not certain the notebook is in the drawer) is also true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
