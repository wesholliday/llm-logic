It doesn't definitively state the toy *is* not in the box.\n\n2. **Understanding the conclusion:** \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" means the toy being in the box is not a certainty.\n\n3. **Analyzing the relationship:** The premise allows for the possibility of the toy being outside the box. This aligns with the conclusion, which states the toy's presence in the box is not guaranteed.\n\n4. **Logical validity:**  A valid argument is one where the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, the conclusion is a direct consequence of the premise.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
