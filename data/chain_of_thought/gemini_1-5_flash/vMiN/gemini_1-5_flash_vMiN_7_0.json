It doesn't definitively state he didn't finish.\n\n2. **Understanding the conclusion:** \"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race\" means it's not certain Alex finished. This aligns with the possibility presented in the premise.\n\n3. **Logical validity:** An argument is logically valid if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In this case, the premise allows for the possibility that Alex didn't finish, which makes the conclusion true. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
