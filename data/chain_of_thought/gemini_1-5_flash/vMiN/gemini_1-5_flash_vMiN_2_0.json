The conclusion, however, makes a stronger statement, ruling out the possibility of the griffin being in the forest entirely.\n\n3. **Identifying the Flaw:** The argument jumps to a conclusion that is not necessarily supported by the premise. Just because something *might not* be true doesn't mean it *must not* be true. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
