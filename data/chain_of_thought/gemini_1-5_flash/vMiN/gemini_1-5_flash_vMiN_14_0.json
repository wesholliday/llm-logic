It doesn't definitively state that the milk *is* not on the counter.\n\n2. **Understanding the conclusion:** \"It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter\" means it's not a certainty that the milk is on the counter.\n\n3. **Analyzing the relationship:** The premise allows for the possibility that the milk is not on the counter. This aligns with the conclusion, which states that it's not a certainty the milk is on the counter.\n\n4. **Logical validity:**  A valid argument is one where the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, the conclusion is a direct consequence of the premise. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
