In this case, P is \"the flug was blummed\" and Q is \"the flug was zimmed\".\n2. **Consider the contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n3. **Apply the contrapositive:**  We are given \"The flug was not zimmed\" (not Q).  The contrapositive tells us that if not Q, then not P. Therefore, we can infer \"The flug was not blummed\" (not P).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
