It means that if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked. \n2. **Premise 2:** \"The splat did not quank.\" This tells us the consequence of the conditional statement (quanking) did not occur.\n3. **Reasoning:**  Since the splat did not quank, and the conditional statement says that quanking is a necessary consequence of morphing, we can infer that the splat was not morphed. This is called the **Modus Tollens** logical rule.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
