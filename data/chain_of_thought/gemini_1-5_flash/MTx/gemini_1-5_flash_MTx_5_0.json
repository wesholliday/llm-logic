It says that if the first part (the zinger was fraggled) is true, then the second part (the zinger was smoogled) must also be true.\n\n3. **Applying the logic:** We know the second part of the conditional statement is false (the zinger was not smoogled).  \n\n4. **Modus Tollens:** This situation aligns with a logical rule called Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens states: If a conditional statement is true and its consequent is false, then its antecedent must also be false.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since the conditional statement is true and the consequent (\"the zinger was smoogled\") is false, we can infer that the antecedent (\"the zinger was fraggled\") must also be false.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
