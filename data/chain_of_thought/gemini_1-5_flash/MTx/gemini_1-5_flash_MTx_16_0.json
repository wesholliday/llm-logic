It states that if the sneg was crampled (antecedent), then the sneg sproted the frink (consequent).\n\n3. **Apply the contrapositive rule:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of Premise 1 is \"If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\"\n\n4. **Compare the contrapositive to Premise 2:** Premise 2 states that the sneg did not sproted the frink. This matches the antecedent of the contrapositive.\n\n5. **Draw the conclusion:** Since the antecedent of the contrapositive is true (Premise 2), we can infer that the consequent of the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The sneg was not crampled.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
