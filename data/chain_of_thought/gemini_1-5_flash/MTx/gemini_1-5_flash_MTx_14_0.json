The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n4. **Form the contrapositive:**\n   - The contrapositive of Statement 1 is \"If the clug did not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked.\"\n\n5. **Compare the contrapositive to Statement 2:**\n   - Statement 2 tells us \"The clug did not snugged\". This matches the \"If not Q\" part of the contrapositive.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Statement 2 matches the \"If not Q\" part of the contrapositive, we can infer the \"not P\" part, which is \"The clug was not fleeked\".\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
