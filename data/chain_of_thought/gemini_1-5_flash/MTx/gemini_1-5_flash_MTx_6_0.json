It says that if the grommet was sploffed, then a specific consequence (plopping the frink) must follow.\n\n3. **Applying the contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of our first statement is: \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since we are given that the grommet did not plop the frink, and we know the contrapositive is true, we can infer that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
