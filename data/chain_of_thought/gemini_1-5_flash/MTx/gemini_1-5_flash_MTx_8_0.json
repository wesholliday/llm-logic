It states: If P then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n4. **Applying Modus Tollens:**  We can apply Modus Tollens to our premises.  \n    * P: The sprocket was cranked.\n    * Q: The sprocket was daggled.\n    * Not Q: The sprocket was not daggled.\n5. **Conclusion:** Since we have \"Not Q\", we can infer \"Not P\".  Therefore, we can infer \"The sprocket was not cranked\".\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
