It states that if the first part (the smip was shripped) is true, then the second part (the smip lupped the zoint) must also be true.\n\n3. **Apply the contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of Premise 1 is \"If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped.\"\n\n4. **Combine the contrapositive with Premise 2:** Since Premise 2 states that the smip did not lup the zoint, and the contrapositive tells us that if this is true, then the smip was not shripped, we can infer that the smip was not shripped.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
