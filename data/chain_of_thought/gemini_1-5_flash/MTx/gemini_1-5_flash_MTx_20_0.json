It means that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it *must* have surned. \n2. **Premise 2:** \"The fleeg did not surn.\" This tells us the consequence of the conditional statement (surning) did not occur.\n3. **Reasoning:**  Since the fleeg did not surn, and the conditional statement says it *must* have surned if it was bluttered, then the antecedent (being bluttered) cannot be true. \n4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we can infer that \"The fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
