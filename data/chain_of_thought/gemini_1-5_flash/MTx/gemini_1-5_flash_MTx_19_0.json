It states that if the first part (the smonk was vreebled) is true, then the second part (the smonk plagged) must also be true.\n\n3. **Apply the contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of Premise 1 is \"If the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled.\"\n\n4. **Combine the contrapositive with Premise 2:** Since we know \"The smonk did not plagged\" (Premise 2), and the contrapositive tells us that if this is true, then \"The smonk was not vreebled\" must also be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
