It states that if the first part (the wug was flooped) is true, then the second part (the wug bimmed the zoint) must also be true.\n\n3. **Apply the contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of Premise 1 is \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\"\n\n4. **Compare the contrapositive to Premise 2:** Premise 2 states that the wug did not bim the zoint. This matches the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the contrapositive.\n\n5. **Draw the conclusion:** Since the antecedent of the contrapositive is true (Premise 2), we can infer that the consequent (the \"then\" part) of the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The wug was not flooped.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
