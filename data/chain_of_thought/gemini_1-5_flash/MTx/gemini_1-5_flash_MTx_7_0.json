The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n4. **Form the contrapositive of Statement 1:** \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\n5. **Compare the contrapositive with Statement 2:** Statement 2 tells us \"The whiffle did not tink\". This matches the \"If not Q\" part of the contrapositive.\n\n6. **Draw the inference:** Since Statement 2 matches the \"If not Q\" part of the contrapositive, we can infer the \"not P\" part, which is \"The whiffle was not shanked\".\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
