It means that if the wug was sproinged, then it must also be garpled. \n2. **Premise 2:** \"The wug was not garpled.\" This directly contradicts the consequence of the conditional statement in Premise 1.\n3. **Inference:** Since the consequence of the conditional statement is false, we can infer that the antecedent must also be false. This is known as Modus Tollens, a valid argument form in logic.\n4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we can infer that \"The wug was not sproinged.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
