In this case, P is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and Q is \"the fribble crinked\".\n\n2. **The statement \"The fribble did not crink\" tells us that Q is false.**\n\n3. **To infer \"The fribble was not snurgled\" (meaning P is false), we need to use the contrapositive of the original conditional statement.** The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n4. **The contrapositive of our original statement is \"If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\".**\n\n5. **Since we know Q is false (the fribble did not crink), and the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer that P is also false (the fribble was not snurgled).**\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
