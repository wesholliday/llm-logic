Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n4. **Applying Modus Tollens:**  We can apply Modus Tollens to our premises.  \n    * P: The flugel was blimmed.\n    * Q: The flugel was zargled.\n    * We know \"Not Q\" is true.\n5. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we can infer \"Not P,\" which means \"The flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
