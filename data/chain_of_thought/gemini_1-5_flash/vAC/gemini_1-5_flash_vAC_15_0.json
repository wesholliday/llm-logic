It says that Sam taking a plane *implies* Erin taking a train.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** Erin took a train.\n   * This confirms the consequent (the part after \"then\") of the conditional statement in Premise 1.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** Sam took a plane.\n   * This is the antecedent (the part before \"then\") of the conditional statement in Premise 1.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe argument is *not* logically valid.  Here's why:\n\n* **The argument form is called \"Affirming the Consequent.\"** This form is known to be a fallacy. \n* **Just because the consequent is true (Erin took a train), it doesn't automatically mean the antecedent is true (Sam took a plane).** There could be other reasons why Erin took a train. \n\n**Example:** Sam could have driven, and Erin took the train for a different reason entirely.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
