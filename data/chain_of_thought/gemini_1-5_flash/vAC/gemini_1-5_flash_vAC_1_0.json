P is true. Therefore, Q is true.\n* In our case, P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n* Premise 1 states the conditional \"If P, then Q\".\n* Premise 2 states that P is true (Sue was at the wedding).\n* However, the conclusion jumps to the conclusion that Mary was at the wedding (P). \n* **The argument is not logically valid because it does not follow the rules of modus ponens.**  While the premises are true, the conclusion does not necessarily follow. It's possible that Sue was at the wedding without Mary being there.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
