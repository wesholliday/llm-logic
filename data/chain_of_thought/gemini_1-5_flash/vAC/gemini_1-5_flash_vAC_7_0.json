It means that if Alex finished, then Chris *must* have also finished. \n2. **Premise 2:** \"Chris finished the race is true.\" This tells us that Chris did indeed finish the race.\n3. **Conclusion:** \"Alex finished the race.\"  This is what we are trying to determine if the argument logically supports.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe argument is trying to use the fact that Chris finished to conclude that Alex must have also finished. However, the first premise only tells us what happens *if* Alex finishes. It doesn't tell us what happens if Alex *didn't* finish.  It's possible that Chris finished the race without Alex finishing.\n\n**Example:** Imagine Chris started the race later than Alex, and Alex dropped out before Chris even started. Chris could still finish the race without Alex finishing.\n\n**Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
