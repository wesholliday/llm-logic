It says that the vampire being awake is a sufficient condition for the mummy being awake. \n2. **Premise 2:** \"The mummy was awake.\" This tells us the consequent of the conditional statement in premise 1 is true.\n3. **Conclusion:** \"The vampire was awake.\" This claims the antecedent of the conditional statement in premise 1 is true.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe argument is not logically valid.  While the premises suggest a connection between the vampire and mummy's wakefulness, they don't guarantee that the vampire was awake.  Here's why:\n\n* **The mummy could be awake for other reasons.**  The premise only states that if the vampire is awake, the mummy is awake. It doesn't say that the vampire is the *only* reason the mummy could be awake. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
