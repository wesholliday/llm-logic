It doesn't say the car *was* red, only that *if* it was, then the truck was blue.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The truck was blue.\" This tells us the consequence of the conditional statement in Premise 1 is true.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"The car was red.\" This is the antecedent of the conditional statement in Premise 1.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe argument is trying to use the fact that the consequence of the conditional statement is true to conclude that the antecedent must also be true. This is a common logical fallacy called **affirming the consequent**. \n\n**Example:**\n\n* If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\n* The ground is wet.\n* Therefore, it must be raining.\n\nThis is not logically valid because the ground could be wet for other reasons (e.g., someone spilled water).\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
