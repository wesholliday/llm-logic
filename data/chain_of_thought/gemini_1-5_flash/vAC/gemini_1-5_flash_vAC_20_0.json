It doesn't say the apple *was* red, only that *if* it was, then the banana was yellow.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The banana was yellow.\" This tells us something about the banana, but doesn't directly relate to the apple's color.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"The apple was red.\" This is what we're trying to determine if the premises logically support.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe argument is trying to use the fact that the banana was yellow to conclude that the apple was red. However, the conditional statement in premise 1 only works one way. It doesn't guarantee that if the banana is yellow, then the apple must be red. There could be other reasons why the banana was yellow.\n\n**Example:** Imagine the banana was yellow because it was ripe, and the apple's color is irrelevant.\n\n**Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
