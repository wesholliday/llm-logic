It means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob *must* have chosen pasta. \n2. **Premise 2:** \"Bob chose pasta.\" This confirms the consequent (the \"then\" part) of the conditional statement in premise 1.\n3. **Conclusion:** \"Sue chose pizza.\" This is the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional statement in premise 1.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe argument is trying to use the fact that Bob chose pasta to conclude that Sue chose pizza. However, the conditional statement in premise 1 only tells us what happens *if* Sue chose pizza. It doesn't tell us what happens if Sue didn't choose pizza. Bob could have chosen pasta for other reasons.\n\n**Example:** Imagine Bob always chooses pasta, regardless of what Sue chooses. The premises would still be true, but the conclusion would be false.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
