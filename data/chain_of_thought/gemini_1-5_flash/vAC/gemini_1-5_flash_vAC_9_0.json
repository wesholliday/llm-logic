It says that Lisa buying the red shirt is a sufficient condition for Mark buying the blue shirt.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** Mark bought the blue shirt.\n   * This tells us that the consequent of the conditional statement in Premise 1 is true.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** Lisa bought the red shirt.\n   * This claims that the antecedent of the conditional statement in Premise 1 is also true.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe argument is **not** logically valid.  Here's why:\n\n* **The fallacy of affirming the consequent:**  The argument commits this fallacy.  Just because the consequent of a conditional statement is true (Mark bought the blue shirt) doesn't automatically mean the antecedent is true (Lisa bought the red shirt). \n\n* **Example:**  Consider the statement \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\"  The ground being wet doesn't necessarily mean it's raining. It could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, a spilled bucket of water, etc.).\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
