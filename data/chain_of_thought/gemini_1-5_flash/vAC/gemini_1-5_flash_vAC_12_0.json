It says that Joe going to the park *implies* Lucy going to the zoo.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** Lucy went to the zoo.\n   * This tells us that the consequence of the conditional statement in Premise 1 is true.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** Joe went to the park.\n   * This claims that the antecedent (Joe going to the park) is also true.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe argument is *not* logically valid.  Here's why:\n\n* **The conditional statement doesn't guarantee a reverse implication.**  Just because Lucy went to the zoo doesn't *necessarily* mean Joe went to the park. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo. \n\n**Example:** Maybe Lucy went to the zoo with her friend, and Joe stayed home.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
