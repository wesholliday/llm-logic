It says that the presence of the griffin *implies* the presence of the unicorn.\n* **Premise 2** tells us that the unicorn was indeed present.\n* **The argument is invalid** because the presence of the unicorn doesn't necessarily mean the griffin was also present. The unicorn could have been there without the griffin. \n\n**Example:** Imagine a forest where unicorns are common but griffins are rare. The unicorn being there doesn't guarantee the griffin was there too.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
