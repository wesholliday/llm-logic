It says that if the first part is true (the book was written by James), then the second part must also be true (the book is a mystery novel).\n\n2. **Premise 2:** The book is a mystery novel.\n   * This tells us the second part of the conditional statement is true.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** The book was written by James.\n   * This claims the first part of the conditional statement is true.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe argument is trying to use the fact that the book is a mystery novel (the second part of the conditional being true) to conclude that it was written by James (the first part of the conditional being true). However, this is not logically valid. \n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine a scenario where many authors write mystery novels. Just because a book is a mystery novel doesn't automatically mean James wrote it. There could be other mystery authors.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
