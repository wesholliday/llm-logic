This is not always the case.\n\n3. **Apply to the argument:**\n    * **Premise 1:** If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n    * **Premise 2:** The robot visited Jupiter.\n    * **Conclusion:** The alien visited Mars.\n\n    The argument claims that because the robot visited Jupiter (the consequent), the alien must have visited Mars (the antecedent).\n\n4. **Reasoning:**  While the robot visiting Jupiter might be a consequence of the alien visiting Mars, it could also be due to other reasons.  The argument doesn't rule out other possibilities.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
