Modus Tollens states: If P then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n* **Applying Modus Tollens:**\n    * P: The book was written by James.\n    * Q: The book is a mystery novel.\n    * We know \"Not Q\" (the book is not a mystery novel).\n* **Conclusion:**  Since we have \"Not Q\", we can infer \"Not P\" (the book was not written by James).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
