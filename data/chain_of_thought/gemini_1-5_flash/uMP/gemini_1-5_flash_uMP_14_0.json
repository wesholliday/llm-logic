It tells us that if the first part (bear in the cave) is true, then the second part (wolf in the den) must also be true.\n* Premise 2 confirms that the first part of the conditional statement is true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSince the first part of the conditional statement is true, we can infer that the second part is also true. Therefore, we can infer that the wolf was in the den.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
