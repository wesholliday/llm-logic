If the first part of the conditional (Joe going to the park) is true, then the second part (Lucy going to the zoo) must also be true. Since we know from Premise 2 that Joe did go to the park, the conditions of the conditional are met.\n4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we can infer that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
