It tells us that Chris finishing the race is dependent on Alex finishing the race.\n* Premise 2 confirms the condition of the conditional statement (Alex finished the race).\n* Since the condition is met, we can infer that the consequence of the conditional statement is also true (Chris finished the race).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
