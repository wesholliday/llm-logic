It says that if the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true. \n4. **Conclusion:** Since we know from Premise 2 that the first part of the conditional statement is true, we can infer that the second part must also be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
