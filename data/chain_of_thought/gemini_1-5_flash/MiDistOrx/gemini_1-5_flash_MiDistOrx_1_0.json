The second statement, \"The crunk might be frozz or it might be grazzle a gribble,\" is simply rephrasing the original statement in a slightly different way. It still conveys the same meaning: the crunk could be frozz or it could be grazzle a gribble. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
