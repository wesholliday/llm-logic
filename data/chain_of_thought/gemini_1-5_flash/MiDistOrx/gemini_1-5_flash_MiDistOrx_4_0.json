The zibber might frazzle at quazzle flimble.\n2. The zibber might be quimble.\n\nThe second statement, \"The zibber might frazzle at quazzle flimble or it might be quimble,\" is essentially saying the same thing. It's just rephrasing the original statement by using \"it\" to refer back to the zibber. \n\nTherefore, the second statement is simply a rewording of the first statement and can be inferred from it.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
