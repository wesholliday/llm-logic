This means it could be blimple by flim, or it could be blimple by grooble, or it could be blimple by both. The second statement breaks this down into two possibilities: blimple by flim or blimple by grooble. This is a valid inference because it is a possible scenario within the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
