Quank with zizz\n2. On an snizzle crunk\n\nThe statement we are trying to infer says \"The zazzle might be quank with zizz or it might be on an snizzle crunk\". This statement is simply rephrasing the original statement by using the word \"it\" to refer to the zazzle. It is essentially saying the same thing as the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
