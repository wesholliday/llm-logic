The second statement, \"The zizz might be quank bimboozle or it might be wobble,\" is simply rephrasing the original statement by explicitly stating that the zizz could be either one. Since the second statement is just a rephrasing of the first, we can infer it from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
