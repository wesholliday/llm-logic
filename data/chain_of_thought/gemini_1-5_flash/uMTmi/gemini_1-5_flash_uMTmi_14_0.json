This doesn't definitively say the wolf *wasn't* in the den. It leaves open the possibility that the wolf was in the den.\n* If the wolf was in the den, then according to Premise 1, the bear must have been in the cave. \n* Since we can't definitively rule out the wolf being in the den, we can't definitively rule out the bear being in the cave.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
