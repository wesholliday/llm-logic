This means if the cat is *not* outside, the dog cannot be inside.\n* Premise 2 tells us the cat *might not* have been outside. This doesn't definitively say the cat was inside, but it does leave open the possibility that the cat was not outside.\n* Since the cat might not have been outside, we cannot definitively conclude that the dog was not inside. The dog could have been inside, and the cat could have been somewhere else entirely.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
