It means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark *definitely* bought the blue shirt. \n\n2. **The second statement:** \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\" This statement tells us that it's possible Mark didn't buy the blue shirt. \n\n3. **Combining the statements:**  If Mark *might not* have bought the blue shirt, then it's possible that Lisa didn't buy the red shirt. This is because the first statement establishes a direct link between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. If Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, then Lisa couldn't have bought the red shirt.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
