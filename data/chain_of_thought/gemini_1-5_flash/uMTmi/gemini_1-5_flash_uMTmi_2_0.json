If the griffin is in the forest, the unicorn *must* be there too.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** The unicorn might not have been in the forest.\n   * This statement tells us the unicorn's presence in the forest is uncertain. It could be there, but it also could not be there.\n\n3. **Inference:** Can we infer that the griffin was not in the forest?\n   * To infer the griffin wasn't in the forest, we'd need to show that the unicorn definitely wasn't there. \n   * However, Premise 2 only says the unicorn *might not* have been there. It doesn't definitively rule out the unicorn's presence.\n\n**Therefore, we cannot infer that the griffin was not in the forest.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
