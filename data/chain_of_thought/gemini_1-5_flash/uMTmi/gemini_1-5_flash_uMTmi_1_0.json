It means that if Mary was present, Sue *must* have been there too. \n\n2. **The second statement:** \"Sue might not have been at the wedding.\" This tells us that Sue's presence at the wedding is uncertain. It doesn't definitively say she wasn't there.\n\n3. **Can we infer Mary wasn't at the wedding?**  No.  The first statement tells us that if Mary was there, Sue *must* have been there. Since we know Sue *might* not have been there, it's possible Mary wasn't there either.  \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
