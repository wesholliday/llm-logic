It doesn't mean the truck *must* be metal if the doll isn't plastic.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** The truck might not have been metal.\n   * This statement tells us the truck could be made of something other than metal.\n\n3. **Inference:** Can we infer that the doll was not plastic?\n   * **No.**  Premise 2 doesn't negate the possibility of the doll being plastic. The truck not being metal doesn't automatically mean the doll wasn't plastic. The conditional statement in premise 1 only works in one direction.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
