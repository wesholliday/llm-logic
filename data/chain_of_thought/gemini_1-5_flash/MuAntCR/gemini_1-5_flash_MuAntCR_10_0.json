            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been notarized\" implies that the document was signed. This is because notarization requires a witness to the signature. Therefore, if a document is notarized, it must have been signed.  Since the statement also explicitly states that the document must have been notarized, we can infer that it must have been both signed and notarized.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
