It doesn't rule out the possibility that the toy *is* in the toy box.\n\n2. **Understanding the second statement:** \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" means it's not a certainty that the toy is in the toy box. This allows for the possibility that the toy is not in the toy box.\n\n3. **Comparing the statements:** Both statements express the same idea: there's a possibility the toy is not in the toy box. They don't state that the toy is definitely not in the toy box.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
