It doesn't definitively rule out James as the author.\n\n2. **The inferred statement:** \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James.\" This means it's not certain that James wrote the book.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  If the book *might not* have been written by James, then it's definitely *not the case* that it *must* have been written by James. The original statement allows for other possibilities, making the inferred statement true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
