It doesn't rule out the possibility that it is charging there.\n\n2. **The inferred statement:** \"It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\" This means it's definitely not required for the watch to be charging on the dresser.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  If the watch *might not* be charging on the dresser, then it's definitely not *required* to be charging there. The original statement allows for the possibility of the watch charging elsewhere.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
