It doesn't rule out the possibility that he did finish.\n\n2. **\"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race\"** means it's not certain he finished. This is consistent with the first statement.\n\n3. Since the first statement allows for the possibility that Alex didn't finish, it logically follows that it's not certain he finished.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
