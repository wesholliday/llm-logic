It doesn't rule out the possibility that the dog was inside.\n\n2. **The inferred statement:** \"It's not the case that the dog must have been inside.\" This means it's not certain the dog was inside. \n\n3. **Reasoning:**  If the dog might not have been inside, then it's definitely not the case that the dog *must* have been inside. The original statement allows for the possibility of the dog being outside, which contradicts the idea that the dog must have been inside.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
