It doesn't rule out the possibility that she did choose pizza.\n\n2. **\"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\"** means it's not certain she chose pizza. This statement is compatible with the possibility that she did choose pizza, but it also allows for the possibility that she didn't.\n\n3. **Since the first statement allows for the possibility that Sue chose pizza, and the second statement is compatible with that possibility, we can infer the second statement from the first.**\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
