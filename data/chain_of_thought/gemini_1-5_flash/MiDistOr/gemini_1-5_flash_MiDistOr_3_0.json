The second statement says the keys might be in one place *or* they might be in the other place. This implies that the keys could be in either place, or even both. Since the second statement allows for the possibility of the keys being in both places, while the first statement does not, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
