This means both possibilities are true, but not necessarily at the same time. The second statement says the restaurant might be closed on Mondays *or* it might be open for limited hours. This also means both possibilities are true, but not necessarily at the same time. Since both statements express the same possibilities, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
