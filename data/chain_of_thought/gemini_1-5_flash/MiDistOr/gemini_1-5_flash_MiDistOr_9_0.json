            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The flight might be delayed or on time\" is a statement about the possibility of the flight being delayed or on time. It doesn't exclude the possibility of the flight being on time. The second statement \"The flight might be delayed or it might be on time\" is essentially the same statement, just rephrased. It also acknowledges the possibility of the flight being on time. Therefore, the second statement can be inferred from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
