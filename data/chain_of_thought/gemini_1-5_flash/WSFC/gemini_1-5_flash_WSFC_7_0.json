The team neither wins nor loses (perhaps the match is a draw or abandoned).\n\nThe statement we are trying to infer says the team *might* win *and* *might* lose. This implies that both winning and losing are possible outcomes *at the same time*. This is not possible in a single match.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
