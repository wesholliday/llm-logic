It says that if the first part (the car being red) is true, then the second part (the truck being blue) must also be true.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The car was not red.\" This tells us the first part of the conditional statement is false.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"The truck was not blue.\"  This is where we need to apply logic.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* **Modus Tollens:** The argument uses a logical rule called Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens states: If a conditional statement is true, and the consequent (the second part) is false, then the antecedent (the first part) must also be false. \n* **Applying Modus Tollens:**  We know the conditional statement (Premise 1) is true. We also know the consequent (the truck being blue) is false (from the conclusion). Therefore, according to Modus Tollens, the antecedent (the car being red) must also be false. \n* **Validity:** Since the conclusion follows logically from the premises, the argument is valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
