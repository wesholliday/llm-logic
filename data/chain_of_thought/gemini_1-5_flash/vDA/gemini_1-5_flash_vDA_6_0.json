It means that if Sue's choice is pizza, then Bob's choice *must* be pasta. \n2. **Premise 2:** \"Sue did not choose pizza.\" This tells us that the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional statement in premise 1 is false.\n3. **Conclusion:** \"Bob did not choose pasta.\"  This is the statement we are trying to determine if the premises logically support.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* The argument uses the principle of *modus tollens*.  Modus tollens is a valid argument form that says:\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * Not Q.\n    * Therefore, not P.\n\n* In our case, P is \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q is \"Bob chose pasta.\" \n* Since we know the antecedent (P) is false, and the argument follows the modus tollens form, the conclusion is logically valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
