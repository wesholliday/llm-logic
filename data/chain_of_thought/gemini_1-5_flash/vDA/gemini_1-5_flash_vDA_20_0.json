This type of argument is called *modus tollens*.\n\n2. **Modus Tollens Structure:** Modus tollens follows this pattern:\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * Not P.\n    * Therefore, not Q.\n\n3. **Applying Modus Tollens to the Argument:**\n    * P: The apple was red.\n    * Q: The banana was yellow.\n    * Not P: The apple was not red.\n    * Not Q: The banana was not yellow.\n\n4. **Validity Check:** Modus tollens is a logically valid argument form. If the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
