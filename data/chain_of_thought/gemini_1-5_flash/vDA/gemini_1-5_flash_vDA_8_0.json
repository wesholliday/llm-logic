It means that if the vampire is awake, the mummy *must* also be awake. \n2. **Premise 2:** \"The vampire was not awake.\" This tells us the antecedent (the 'if' part) of the conditional statement is false.\n3. **Conclusion:** \"The mummy was not awake.\"  This is what we're trying to determine if the argument logically supports.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* **Modus Tollens:** The argument follows the pattern of Modus Tollens, a valid argument form. Modus Tollens states: If P then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n* **Applying Modus Tollens:** In our case, P is \"the vampire was awake\" and Q is \"the mummy was awake.\" Since we know the vampire was not awake (not Q), Modus Tollens allows us to conclude that the vampire was not awake (not P).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
