            "content": "Here's how we can break down the argument:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This is a conditional statement. It says that if the first part (the cake being chocolate) is true, then the second part (the muffins being blueberry) must also be true.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The cake was not chocolate.\" This tells us the first part of the conditional statement is false.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"The muffins were not blueberry.\"  This is what we're trying to determine if the argument logically supports.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* **Modus Tollens:** The argument follows a pattern called Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens is a valid argument form. It states:\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * Not P.\n    * Therefore, not Q.\n\n* **Applying Modus Tollens:** In our case:\n    * P = The cake was chocolate.\n    * Q = The muffins were blueberry.\n\nSince the argument follows the Modus Tollens pattern, it is logically valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
