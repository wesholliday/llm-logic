It states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have also finished. \n2. **Analyzing the premises:** The first premise is a conditional statement. The second premise states that the antecedent (Alex finishing the race) is false.\n3. **Applying Modus Tollens:** This argument follows the form of Modus Tollens, a valid argument form. Modus Tollens states:\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * Not P.\n    * Therefore, not Q.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the argument follows the valid form of Modus Tollens, the conclusion is logically valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
