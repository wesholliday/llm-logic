            "content": "Here's how we can break down the argument:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This is a conditional statement. It means that if the first part is true (the dog was inside), then the second part must also be true (the cat was outside).\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The dog was not inside.\" This tells us the first part of the conditional statement in premise 1 is false.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"The cat was not outside.\"  This is what we are trying to determine if the argument logically supports.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* **Modus Tollens:** The argument follows a pattern called Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens is a valid argument form. It states:\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * Not P.\n    * Therefore, not Q.\n\n* **Applying Modus Tollens:** In our case:\n    * P = The dog was inside\n    * Q = The cat was outside\n\nSince the argument follows the Modus Tollens pattern, and Modus Tollens is a valid argument form, the conclusion is logically supported by the premises.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
