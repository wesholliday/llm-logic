            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the argument's form:** The argument is a conditional statement (if-then) followed by the negation of the antecedent (the first part of the if-then statement) and concluding with the negation of the consequent (the second part of the if-then statement). This is known as **Modus Tollens**.\n\n2. **Understand Modus Tollens:** Modus Tollens is a valid argument form. It states that if a conditional statement is true and the antecedent is false, then the consequent must also be false.\n\n3. **Apply to the argument:**\n    * The conditional statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n    * The negation of the antecedent is \"Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n    * The conclusion is \"Sue was not at the wedding.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the argument follows the form of Modus Tollens, it is logically valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
