            "content": "Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This is a conditional statement. It says that the presence of the griffin in the forest implies the presence of the unicorn.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"The griffin was not in the forest.\" This directly contradicts the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional statement in premise 1.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"The unicorn was not in the forest.\"  This conclusion is drawn from the fact that the griffin was not in the forest, and the conditional statement in premise 1.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe argument is logically valid.  This is because the conclusion follows logically from the premises.  If the griffin was not in the forest, then the conditional statement in premise 1 is irrelevant.  Since the antecedent of the conditional is false, the entire statement is considered true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent (the \"then\" part).  Therefore, we can conclude that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
