This is known as **Modus Tollens**.\n\n2. **Modus Tollens is a valid argument form:**  Modus Tollens is a valid argument form because if the conditional statement is true and the antecedent is false, then the consequent must also be false.\n\n3. **Apply the reasoning to the argument:** In this case, the conditional statement is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" The antecedent (Joe went to the park) is false. Therefore, according to Modus Tollens, the consequent (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be false.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
