It means that if the first part (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the second part (Kate ate salad) must also be true.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"Ben did not eat pasta.\" This tells us the first part of the conditional statement is false.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"Kate did not eat salad.\"  This is what we're trying to determine if the argument logically supports.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* The argument is based on the idea of *modus tollens*, a valid form of logical reasoning. \n* Modus tollens states: If P then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n* In our case, P is \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q is \"Kate ate salad.\"\n* Since we know \"Ben did not eat pasta\" (not P), and the conditional statement (if P then Q) is true, we can conclude that \"Kate did not eat salad\" (not Q).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
