It means that if the first part (Sam taking a plane) is true, then the second part (Erin taking a train) must also be true.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"Sam did not take a plane.\" This tells us the first part of the conditional statement is false.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"Erin did not take a train.\"  This is what we're trying to determine if the argument logically supports.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe argument uses the principle of *modus tollens*.  Modus tollens is a valid argument form that says:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not P.\n* Therefore, not Q.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P = Sam took a plane\n* Q = Erin took a train\n\nSince we know the first part of the conditional statement (P) is false, we can conclude that the second part (Q) must also be false.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
