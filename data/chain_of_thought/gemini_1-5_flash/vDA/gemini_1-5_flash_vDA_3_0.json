This is known as **Modus Tollens**.\n\n2. **Modus Tollens is a valid argument form:**  Modus Tollens is a valid argument form because if the first premise is true and the second premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\n3. **Apply to the given argument:**\n    * Premise 1: If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. (p -> q)\n    * Premise 2: The book was not written by James. (not p)\n    * Conclusion: The book is not a mystery novel. (not q)\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
