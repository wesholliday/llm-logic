            "content": "Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement. It means that if the first part (Tom watching football) is true, then the second part (Jen watching basketball) must also be true.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"Tom did not watch football.\" This tells us the first part of the conditional statement is false.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"Jen did not watch basketball.\"  This is what we're trying to determine if the argument logically supports.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* The argument is based on the idea that if a conditional statement is true and its antecedent (the \"if\" part) is false, then the consequent (the \"then\" part) must also be false. This is a common logical principle called *modus tollens*.\n\n* In this case, the antecedent (Tom watching football) is false.  However, the conditional statement itself doesn't tell us anything about what happens if Tom *didn't* watch football. It only tells us what happens if he *did* watch football.\n\n* Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that Jen did not watch basketball.  It's possible that Jen watched basketball even though Tom didn't watch football.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
