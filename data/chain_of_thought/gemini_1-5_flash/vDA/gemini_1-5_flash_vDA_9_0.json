            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the argument's form:** The argument is a conditional statement (if p, then q) followed by the negation of the antecedent (not p) and concluding with the negation of the consequent (not q). This is known as **Modus Tollens**.\n\n2. **Modus Tollens is a valid argument form:**  Modus Tollens is a valid argument form because if the conditional statement is true and the antecedent is false, then the consequent must also be false.\n\n3. **Apply to the given argument:**\n    * The conditional statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n    * The negation of the antecedent is \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n    * The conclusion is \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the argument follows the valid Modus Tollens form, it is logically valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
