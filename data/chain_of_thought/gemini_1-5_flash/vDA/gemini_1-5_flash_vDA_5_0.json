It means that if the first part (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the second part (Amy playing tennis) must also be true.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"Jeff did not play basketball.\" This tells us the first part of the conditional statement is false.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"Amy did not play tennis.\"  This is the statement we are trying to determine if the argument logically supports.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* The argument uses the principle of *modus tollens*. This principle states that if a conditional statement is true and the consequent (the second part) is false, then the antecedent (the first part) must also be false.\n* In our case, the conditional statement (Premise 1) is true, and the antecedent (Jeff playing basketball) is false (Premise 2). \n* Therefore, according to *modus tollens*, the consequent (Amy playing tennis) must also be false. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
