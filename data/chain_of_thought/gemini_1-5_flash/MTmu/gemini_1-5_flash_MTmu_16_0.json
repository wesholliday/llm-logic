Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n4. **Applying Modus Tollens:**  We can apply Modus Tollens to our premises.  \n    * P: The shirt was cotton.\n    * Q: The pants must have been denim.\n    * Not Q: It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\n5. **Conclusion:**  Therefore, we can infer \"The shirt was not cotton.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
