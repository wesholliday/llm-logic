It states that if we have a conditional statement (If P then Q) and we know that the consequent (Q) is false, then we can infer that the antecedent (P) is also false.\n4. **Applying Modus Tollens:** Since Premise 2 negates the consequent of Premise 1, we can apply Modus Tollens to infer that the antecedent (Alex finished the race) is false.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
