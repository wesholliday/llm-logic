The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of Statement 1 is: \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\n4. **Combining the information:** Since we know Kate did not eat the salad (from Statement 2), and the contrapositive of Statement 1 tells us that if Kate didn't eat the salad, Ben didn't eat pasta, then we can conclude that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
