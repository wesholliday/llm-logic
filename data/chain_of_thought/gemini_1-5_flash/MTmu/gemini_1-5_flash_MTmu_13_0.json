Modus Tollens states: If we have a conditional statement (If P then Q) and we know that Q is false, then we can infer that P is false.\n4. **Applying Modus Tollens:** In our case, P is \"The car was red\" and Q is \"The truck must have been blue.\" We know Q is false (the truck doesn't *have* to be blue). Therefore, we can infer that P is false, meaning \"The car was not red.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
