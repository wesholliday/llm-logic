Not Q. Therefore, not P. \n4. **Applying Modus Tollens:**  We can apply Modus Tollens to our premises.  \n    * P: The doll was plastic.\n    * Q: The truck must have been metal.\n    * Not Q: It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\n5. **Conclusion:**  Therefore, we can infer \"The doll was not plastic.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
