Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n4. **Applying Modus Tollens:**  We can apply Modus Tollens to our premises.  \n    * P: The vampire was awake.\n    * Q: The mummy must have been awake.\n    * Not Q: It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\n5. **Conclusion:** Since we have the form of Modus Tollens, we can infer \"Not P,\" which means \"The vampire was not awake.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
