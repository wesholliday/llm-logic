Not Q. Therefore, not P. \n4. **Applying Modus Tollens:**  We can apply Modus Tollens to our premises.  \n    * P: Mary was at the wedding.\n    * Q: Sue must have been at the wedding.\n    * Not Q: It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\n5. **Conclusion:** Since we have the form of Modus Tollens, we can infer \"Not P,\" which means \"Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
