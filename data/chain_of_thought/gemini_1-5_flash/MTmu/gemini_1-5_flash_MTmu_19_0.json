Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n4. **Applying Modus Tollens:**  We can apply Modus Tollens to our premises.  Since we know \"Jen must have watched basketball\" is false (Premise 2), and the conditional statement (Premise 1) says that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball, we can conclude that Tom did not watch football.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
