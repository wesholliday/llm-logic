Not Q. Therefore, not P. \n4. **Applying Modus Tollens:**  We can apply Modus Tollens to our premises.  \n    * P: The dog was inside.\n    * Q: The cat must have been outside.\n    * Not Q: It's not the case that the cat must have been outside.\n5. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we can infer \"The dog was not inside.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
