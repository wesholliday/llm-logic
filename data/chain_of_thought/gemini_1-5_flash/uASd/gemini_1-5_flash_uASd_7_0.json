This implies a causal relationship \u2013 the oven being on causes the kitchen to warm up.\n\n2. **New Information:** We are given that the oven is on and the pilot light is out. The pilot light being out is irrelevant to the kitchen's temperature. The oven can still heat the kitchen even without a pilot light.\n\n3. **Inference:** Since the oven is on, and the oven being on causes the kitchen to warm up, we can infer that the kitchen is warm. The pilot light being out doesn't change this.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
