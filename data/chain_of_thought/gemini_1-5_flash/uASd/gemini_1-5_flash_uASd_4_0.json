It doesn't mean the dog *always* barks when in the yard, just that if it's in the yard, barking is a possibility.\n\n2. **The question:** \"Can we infer that if the dog is in the yard and it is asleep, then it is barking?\"  We're asked if the original statement guarantees the dog will bark even when asleep.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  Sleeping dogs generally don't bark. The original statement only says barking is possible when the dog is in the yard, not that it's guaranteed.  \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
