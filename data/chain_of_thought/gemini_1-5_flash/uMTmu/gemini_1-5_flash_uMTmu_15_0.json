It states: If P then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n4. **Applying Modus Tollens:**  We can apply this to our premises.  \n    * P: Sam took a plane.\n    * Q: Erin must have taken a train.\n    * Not Q: It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\n5. **Conclusion:** Since we have the form of Modus Tollens, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
