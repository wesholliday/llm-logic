It states: If P then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n4. **Applying Modus Tollens:**  We can apply this to our premises.  \n    * P: Joe went to the park.\n    * Q: Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n    * Since we know \"Not Q\" (Lucy didn't have to go to the zoo), we can infer \"Not P\" (Joe didn't go to the park).\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
