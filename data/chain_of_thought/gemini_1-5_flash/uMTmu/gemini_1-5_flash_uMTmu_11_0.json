It states: If P then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n4. **Applying Modus Tollens:**  We can apply this to our premises.  \n    * P: The cake was chocolate.\n    * Q: The muffins must have been blueberry.\n    * Not Q: It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\n5. **Conclusion:** Since we have the form of Modus Tollens, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
