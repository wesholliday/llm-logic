It means that if Alex finished, Chris *must* have also finished. \n2. **Premise 2:** \"Alex did not finish the race.\" This tells us the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional statement is false.\n3. **Reasoning:**  Since the antecedent is false, the conditional statement itself is considered true, regardless of whether the consequent (the \"then\" part) is true or false.  \n4. **Conclusion:** We cannot infer whether Chris finished the race or not. The conditional statement only tells us what would have happened *if* Alex had finished. It doesn't tell us anything about what happened since Alex didn't finish.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
