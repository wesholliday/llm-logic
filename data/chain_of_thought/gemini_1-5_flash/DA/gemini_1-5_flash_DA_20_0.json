It doesn't say anything about the banana's color if the apple isn't red.\n\n2. **We are given that \"The apple was not red.\"** This means the condition in the conditional statement is false.\n\n3. **When the condition of a conditional statement is false, we cannot infer anything about the conclusion.**  In this case, the conclusion is \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\n4. **Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The banana was not yellow.\"**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
