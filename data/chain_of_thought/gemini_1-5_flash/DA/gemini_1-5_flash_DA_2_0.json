It tells us that the presence of the griffin in the forest *implies* the presence of the unicorn in the forest. However, it doesn't say anything about what happens if the griffin is *not* in the forest.\n\n3. **Applying Premise 2:** Since the griffin was not in the forest, we cannot directly apply the conditional statement from Premise 1. The conditional statement only applies when the griffin *is* in the forest.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** We cannot infer that the unicorn was not in the forest. The unicorn could still be in the forest even if the griffin isn't.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
