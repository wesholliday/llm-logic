            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **The given statement:** \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This is a conditional statement. \n2. **The second statement:** \"The shirt was not cotton.\" This tells us the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional statement is false.\n3. **The question:** Can we infer \"The pants were not denim\"?  This asks if we can conclude the consequent (the \"then\" part) is false.\n4. **Reasoning:**  In logic, when the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, we cannot conclude anything about the truth value of the consequent. This is because the statement only makes a claim about what happens *if* the antecedent is true. \n5. **Example:**  Consider the statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" If it's not raining, we can't say for sure whether the ground is wet or not. It could be wet for other reasons.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
