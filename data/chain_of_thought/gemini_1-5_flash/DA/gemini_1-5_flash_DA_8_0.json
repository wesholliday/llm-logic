It tells us that the mummy's wakefulness is dependent on the vampire's wakefulness. \n2. **Premise 2:** \"The vampire was not awake.\" This directly contradicts the condition in premise 1.\n3. **Inference:** Since the condition in premise 1 is false (the vampire was not awake), we cannot conclude anything about the mummy's state. The conditional statement only tells us what would happen *if* the vampire was awake. It doesn't tell us anything about what happens when the vampire is *not* awake.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
