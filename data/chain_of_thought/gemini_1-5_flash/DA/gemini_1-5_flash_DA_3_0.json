            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the premises:**\n   - Premise 1: If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n   - Premise 2: The book was not written by James.\n\n2. **Analyze the structure of Premise 1:** This is a conditional statement (if-then). It states that if the first part (the book was written by James) is true, then the second part (the book is a mystery novel) must also be true.\n\n3. **Apply the concept of Modus Tollens:** Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that says:\n   - If P, then Q.\n   - Not Q.\n   - Therefore, not P.\n\n4. **Map the premises to Modus Tollens:**\n   - P: The book was written by James.\n   - Q: The book is a mystery novel.\n   - Not Q: The book is not a mystery novel.\n\n5. **Apply Modus Tollens:** Since we have \"Not Q\" (the book is not a mystery novel) and the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\", we can infer \"Not P\" (the book was not written by James).\n\n6. **Conclusion:** We cannot infer \"The book is not a mystery novel\" from the given premises. The premises only tell us that the book was not written by James, but they don't provide any information about the genre of the book.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
