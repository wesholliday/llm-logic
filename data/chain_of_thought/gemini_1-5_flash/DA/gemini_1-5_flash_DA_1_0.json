It means that if Mary's presence is true, then Sue's presence must also be true. \n2. **The given information:** \"Mary was not at the wedding\" tells us that the first part of the conditional statement is false.\n3. **The question:** Can we infer \"Sue was not at the wedding\"?  \n4. **Reasoning:**  Since the first part of the conditional statement is false, the statement itself doesn't tell us anything definitive about Sue's presence. The conditional statement only guarantees Sue's presence if Mary was there.  \n5. **Conclusion:** We cannot infer that Sue was not at the wedding. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
