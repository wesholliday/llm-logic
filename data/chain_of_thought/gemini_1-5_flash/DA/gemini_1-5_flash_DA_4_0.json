It has the form \"If P, then Q\", where:\n   - P: The alien visited Mars.\n   - Q: The robot visited Jupiter.\n\n3. **Apply the rule of Modus Tollens:** Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that states:\n   - If P, then Q.\n   - Not P.\n   - Therefore, not Q.\n\n4. **Match the premises to Modus Tollens:**\n   - Premise 1 matches the \"If P, then Q\" part.\n   - Premise 2 matches the \"Not P\" part.\n\n5. **Apply the conclusion of Modus Tollens:** Since we have both premises of Modus Tollens, we can conclude \"Not Q\", which means \"The robot did not visit Jupiter\".\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
