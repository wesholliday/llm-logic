If the car isn't red, the statement doesn't tell us anything about the truck's color.\n\n2. **We are given that \"The car was not red.\"** This means the condition of the conditional statement is false.\n\n3. **When the condition of a conditional statement is false, the statement itself is considered true, regardless of the truth value of the conclusion.**  In this case, the conclusion is \"The truck was blue.\"  Since the condition is false, the statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is true, even if the truck is not blue.\n\n4. **Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The truck was not blue.\"**  The information given doesn't tell us anything about the truck's color.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
