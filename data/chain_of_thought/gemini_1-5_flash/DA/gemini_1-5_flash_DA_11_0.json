In this case, P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry\".\n2. **Consider the second statement:** The second statement tells us that the antecedent (P) is false: \"The cake was not chocolate\".\n3. **Apply the rule of Modus Tollens:** Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that states: If P then Q, and not P, then not Q.  Since we have both parts of Modus Tollens, we can infer the consequent (not Q), which is \"The muffins were not blueberry\".\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
