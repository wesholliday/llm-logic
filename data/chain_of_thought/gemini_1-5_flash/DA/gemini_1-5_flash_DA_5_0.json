The key to understanding conditional statements is that they only guarantee a conclusion if the condition is true.\n\n3. **Apply the premises:** Since Premise 2 states that Jeff did not play basketball (the condition in Premise 1 is false), we cannot infer anything about Amy playing tennis. The conditional statement only guarantees Amy played tennis *if* Jeff played basketball.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
