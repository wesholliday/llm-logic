Just because a conditional statement is true, doesn't mean its converse is also true.\n3. **Example:** Consider the statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" This is true. However, its converse \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining\" is not necessarily true. The ground could be wet for other reasons (e.g., someone spilled water).\n\n**Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
