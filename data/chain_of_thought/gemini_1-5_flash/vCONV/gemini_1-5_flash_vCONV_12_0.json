For example, \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet\" is true, but its converse, \"If the ground is wet, then it's raining\" is not always true (the ground could be wet from other sources).\n5. **Conclusion:** Since the conclusion is the converse of the premise, the argument is not logically valid.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
