            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the argument:** The argument claims that if Mary's presence at the wedding implies Sue's presence, then Sue's presence must also imply Mary's presence.\n\n2. **Analyzing the relationship:**  The original premise establishes a one-way implication: Mary's presence *guarantees* Sue's presence. It doesn't necessarily work the other way around.\n\n3. **Counterexample:** Imagine a scenario where Sue is always at weddings, but Mary only attends weddings with her close friend, John. If John isn't there, Mary won't be either. In this case, Sue could be at the wedding without Mary being there.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** The argument is not logically valid because the conclusion doesn't follow directly from the premise. The premise only establishes a one-way implication, while the conclusion assumes a two-way implication.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
