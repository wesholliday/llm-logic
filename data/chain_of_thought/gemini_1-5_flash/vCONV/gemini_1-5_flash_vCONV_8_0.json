However, the reverse \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining\" is not necessarily true (the ground could be wet from other sources).\n\n4. **Applying the example:**  Similarly, just because the vampire being awake implies the mummy being awake, doesn't mean the mummy being awake implies the vampire being awake. The mummy could be awake for other reasons.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
