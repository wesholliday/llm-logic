They are not logically equivalent. \n\n3. **Example to illustrate:** Imagine Sue chose pizza, and Bob chose salad. The premise would be true (since Sue chose pizza, Bob didn't choose pasta). However, the conclusion would be false (Bob didn't choose pasta, but Sue still chose pizza).\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since we can find a scenario where the premise is true but the conclusion is false, the argument is not logically valid.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
