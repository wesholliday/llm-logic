This is a conditional statement.\n2. **We also know:** \"The book is a mystery novel\" is true.\n3. **The question:** Does it necessarily follow that \"The book was written by James\" is true?\n4. **Reasoning:**  The conditional statement doesn't guarantee that the book *must* be written by James. It only states that *if* it was written by James, *then* it's a mystery novel.  There could be other authors who write mystery novels.\n5. **Example:** Imagine a scenario where there are many mystery novel authors.  Just because a book is a mystery novel doesn't mean it was written by James.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
