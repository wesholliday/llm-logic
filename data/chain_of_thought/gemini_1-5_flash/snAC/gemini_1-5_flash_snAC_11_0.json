However, it doesn't say anything about what happens if the cake *isn't* chocolate. \n\n2. **The statement \"The muffins were blueberry\" is true.** This confirms that the muffins are indeed blueberry.\n\n3. **We need to determine if the cake *must* be chocolate.**  Since the first statement only tells us what happens *if* the cake is chocolate, it doesn't rule out the possibility that the muffins could be blueberry even if the cake isn't chocolate.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
