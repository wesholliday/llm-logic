It means that if the first part (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the second part (Amy playing tennis) must also be true.\n\n2. **The additional information:** \"Jeff did not play basketball.\" This tells us the first part of the conditional statement is false.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  Since the first part of the conditional statement is false, we cannot conclude anything about the second part. The conditional statement only guarantees that if the first part is true, then the second part is true. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the first part is false.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
