It means that the mummy's wakefulness is dependent on the vampire's wakefulness.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** The vampire was not awake.\n   * This tells us the condition in premise 1 is false.\n\n3. **Reasoning:** Since the vampire was not awake, the condition in premise 1 is not met. Therefore, we cannot conclude anything about the mummy's wakefulness based on premise 1.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
