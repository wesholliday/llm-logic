It tells us that denim pants are a consequence of a cotton shirt.\n* Premise 2 tells us the antecedent (cotton shirt) is false.\n* In logic, when the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, we cannot conclude anything about the consequent (denim pants). \n\n**Example:** If it's raining, then the ground is wet. It's not raining. Can we conclude the ground is not wet? No, the ground could be wet for other reasons.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
