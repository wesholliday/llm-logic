It doesn't say the car *is* red, just that *if* it were, then the truck would be blue.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** The car was not red.\n   * This tells us the first part of the conditional statement (the car being red) is false.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  Since the first part of the conditional statement is false, we can't conclude anything about the second part (the truck being blue).  The statement only tells us what would happen *if* the car were red. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the car isn't red.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
