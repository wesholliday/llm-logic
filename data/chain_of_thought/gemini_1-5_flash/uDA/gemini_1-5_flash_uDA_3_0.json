It tells us that if the antecedent (the book being written by James) is true, then the consequent (the book being a mystery novel) must also be true.\n* Premise 2 tells us that the antecedent is false. \n* Since the antecedent is false, we cannot conclude anything about the consequent. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if the antecedent is true. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the antecedent is false.\n\n**Therefore, we cannot infer that the book is not a mystery novel.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
