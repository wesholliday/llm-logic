It means that if the first part (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the second part (Kate ate salad) must also be true. \n\n2. **The additional information:** \"Ben did not eat pasta.\" This tells us the first part of the conditional statement is false.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  Since the first part of the conditional statement is false, we cannot conclude anything about the second part. The statement only tells us what happens *if* Ben eats pasta. It doesn't say anything about what happens if he doesn't.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
