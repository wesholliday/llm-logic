Since the cake was not chocolate (Premise 2), the consequent of the conditional (the muffins being blueberry) does not necessarily hold true.  The conditional statement only tells us what happens *if* the cake is chocolate. It doesn't tell us what happens if the cake is *not* chocolate.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
