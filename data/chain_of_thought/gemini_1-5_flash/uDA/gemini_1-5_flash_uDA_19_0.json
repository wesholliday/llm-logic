This is a conditional statement.\n2. **Premise 2:** Tom did not watch football. This tells us the antecedent (Tom watching football) is false.\n3. **Reasoning:**  In a conditional statement, if the antecedent is false, we cannot conclude anything about the consequent (Jen watching basketball). This is because the statement only guarantees the consequent is true *if* the antecedent is true. It doesn't say anything about what happens when the antecedent is false.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
