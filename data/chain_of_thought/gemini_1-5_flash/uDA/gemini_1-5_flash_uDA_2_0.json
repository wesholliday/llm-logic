It tells us that the presence of the griffin in the forest implies the presence of the unicorn.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** The griffin was not in the forest.\n   * This directly contradicts the first part of the conditional statement.\n\n3. **Inference:** Since the griffin was not in the forest, we cannot conclude anything about the unicorn's location based on the given information. The conditional statement only tells us what would happen *if* the griffin was in the forest. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the griffin is *not* in the forest.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
