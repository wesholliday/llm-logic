This is a conditional statement.\n2. **Premise 2:** Alex did not finish the race. This contradicts the \"if\" part of the conditional statement.\n3. **Inference:** Since the \"if\" part of the conditional statement is false, we cannot conclude anything about the \"then\" part.  The conditional statement doesn't tell us what happens if Alex *didn't* finish. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
