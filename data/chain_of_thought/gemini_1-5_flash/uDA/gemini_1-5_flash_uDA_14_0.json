It tells us that the wolf being in the den is dependent on the bear being in the cave.\n* Premise 2 tells us the condition (bear in the cave) is false.\n* Since the condition is false, we cannot conclude anything about the consequence (wolf in the den). The wolf could be in the den or not, regardless of the bear's absence from the cave.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
