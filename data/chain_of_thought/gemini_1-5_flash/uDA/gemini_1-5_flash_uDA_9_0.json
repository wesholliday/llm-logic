It tells us that Mark buying the blue shirt is dependent on Lisa buying the red shirt.\n* Premise 2 tells us the condition in Premise 1 is false (Lisa didn't buy the red shirt).\n* Since the condition is false, we cannot conclude anything about the consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt). The conditional statement doesn't tell us what happens if Lisa *doesn't* buy the red shirt.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
