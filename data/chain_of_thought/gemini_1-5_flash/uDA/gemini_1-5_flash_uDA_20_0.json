It doesn't say the apple *is* red, just that *if* it were, then the banana would be yellow.\n\n2. **The additional information:** \"The apple was not red.\" This tells us the first part of the conditional statement is false.\n\n3. **Applying logic:**  In logic, when a conditional statement has a false antecedent (the \"if\" part), the entire statement is considered true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent (the \"then\" part). \n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the apple is not red, the conditional statement is true. However, this doesn't tell us anything definitive about the banana's color. The banana could be yellow, or it could be any other color. \n\n**Answer: no** \n"
