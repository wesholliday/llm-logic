It tells us that the cat being outside is a consequence of the dog being inside.\n* Premise 2 tells us the condition (dog being inside) is false.\n* In logic, when a conditional statement's antecedent (the \"if\" part) is false, we cannot conclude anything about the consequent (the \"then\" part). \n\n**Therefore, we cannot infer that the cat was not outside.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
