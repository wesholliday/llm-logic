In logic, if the first part of a conditional statement is false, the entire statement is considered true, regardless of the truth value of the second part. \n4. **Therefore:** We cannot infer whether Lucy went to the zoo or not. The statement doesn't tell us anything about Lucy's actions if Joe didn't go to the park.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
