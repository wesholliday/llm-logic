It's possible the computer is on but not running a scan, or it's running a scan but is off.  The statement \"The computer might be on and running a virus scan\" implies that both events are happening at the same time. Since the first statement doesn't guarantee the events are happening simultaneously, we cannot infer the second statement.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
