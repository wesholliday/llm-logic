The painting is in the museum, but not being restored.\n2. The painting is being restored, but not in the museum.\n\nIt is possible that both are true, but it is also possible that only one is true. We cannot infer that the painting is being restored in the museum because the statement does not explicitly state that. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
