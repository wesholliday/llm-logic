The concert might be cancelled.\n2. The concert might be rescheduled.\n\nIt does not necessarily imply that both possibilities will happen simultaneously. It is possible that the concert is cancelled without being rescheduled, or rescheduled without being cancelled. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The concert might be cancelled and rescheduled\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
