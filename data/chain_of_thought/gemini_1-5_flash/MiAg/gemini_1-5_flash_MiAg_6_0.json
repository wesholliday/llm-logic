The movie is playing at the cinema.\n2. The movie is sold out.\n\nThese possibilities are independent of each other. It's possible for the movie to be playing but not sold out, or sold out but not playing.  Therefore, we cannot infer that the movie is both playing and sold out at the cinema.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
