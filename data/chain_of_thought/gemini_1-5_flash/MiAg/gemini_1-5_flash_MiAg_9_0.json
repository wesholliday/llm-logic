The package might be damaged. \n\nHowever, it doesn't necessarily mean that both possibilities will happen at the same time. The package could be delivered today but not damaged, or it could be damaged but not delivered today. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the package might be delivered damaged today.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
