The envelope is upstairs.\n2. The envelope is under a bed. \n\nThese possibilities are separate and do not necessarily overlap. It's possible the envelope is upstairs in a different location than under a bed. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the envelope might be upstairs under a bed.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
