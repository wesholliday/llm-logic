It doesn't provide any information about whether the car needed repairs.  The statement \"The car must have been in the garage and needed repairs\" adds the additional information about the car needing repairs.  Since the original statement doesn't imply the car needed repairs, we cannot infer the second statement.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
