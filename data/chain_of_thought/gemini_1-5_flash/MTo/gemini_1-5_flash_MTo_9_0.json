It says that if the first part (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true. \n5. **Contradiction:**  Premise 1 tells us that the second part of the conditional statement (Mark bought the blue shirt) is false. \n6. **Conclusion:** Since the second part of the conditional statement is false, the first part (Lisa bought the red shirt) must also be false.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
