It says that if the first part (Joe went to the park) is true, then the second part (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true. \n5. **Contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of Premise 2 is: If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\n6. **Applying the contrapositive:** Since we know Lucy did not go to the zoo (Premise 1), and the contrapositive of Premise 2 is true, we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
