It says that if the first part (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the second part (Kate ate the salad) must also be true. \n5. **Contradiction:** Premise 1 tells us that Kate did not eat the salad. This contradicts the second part of the conditional statement in Premise 2.\n6. **Conclusion:** Since the second part of the conditional statement is false, the first part (Ben ate pasta) must also be false. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
