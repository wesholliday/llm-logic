If the antecedent (the alien visited Mars) is true, then the consequent (the robot visited Jupiter) must also be true. \n5. **Contradiction:** Premise 1 tells us the consequent is false (the robot did not visit Jupiter). \n6. **Modus Tollens:**  Since the consequent is false, we can infer that the antecedent must also be false. This is a logical rule called Modus Tollens.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
