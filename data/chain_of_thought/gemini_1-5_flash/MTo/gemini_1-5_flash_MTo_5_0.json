It says that if the first part (Jeff played basketball) is true, then the second part (Amy played tennis) must also be true. \n5. **Contradiction:** Premise 1 tells us that Amy did *not* play tennis. This contradicts the second part of the conditional statement in Premise 2.\n6. **Conclusion:** Since the second part of the conditional statement is false, the first part must also be false. Therefore, Jeff did not play basketball.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
