It tells us that if the first part (Alex finished the race) is true, then the second part (Chris finished the race) must also be true. \n5. **Contradiction:**  Premise 1 tells us that Chris did not finish the race. This contradicts the second part of the conditional statement in premise 2.\n6. **Conclusion:** Since the second part of the conditional statement is false, the first part must also be false. Therefore, Alex did not finish the race.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
