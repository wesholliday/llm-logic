It says that Mary being at the wedding *implies* Sue being at the wedding.\n* Since we know from Premise 1 that Sue was *not* at the wedding, the condition in Premise 2 (Mary being at the wedding) cannot be true. \n* If the condition is false, the entire conditional statement is considered true, regardless of whether the conclusion (Sue being at the wedding) is true or false.\n* Therefore, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
