It says that if the first part (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the second part (Bob chose pasta) must also be true. \n5. **Contrapositive:** The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of Premise 2 is: If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\n6. **Applying the contrapositive:** Since we know from Premise 1 that Bob did not choose pasta, we can apply the contrapositive of Premise 2 to conclude that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
