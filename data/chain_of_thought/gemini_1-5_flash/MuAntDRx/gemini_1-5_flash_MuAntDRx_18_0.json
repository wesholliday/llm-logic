It must be snork with gribble.\n2. It must be on an blimple grooble.\n\nWe cannot infer that the frazzle must be on an blimple grooble because it could also be snork with gribble. The statement only tells us that one of these two possibilities must be true, not that both must be true.\n\nAnswer: no \n"
