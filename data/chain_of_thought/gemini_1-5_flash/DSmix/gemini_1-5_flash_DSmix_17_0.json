However, Premise 2 only states it's *possible* the flob is not movated, not that it *definitely* is not movated. \n4. **Conclusion:** We cannot definitively infer that the flob is skizzled. It's possible the flob is both skizzled and movated, or it's possible the flob is only movated.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
