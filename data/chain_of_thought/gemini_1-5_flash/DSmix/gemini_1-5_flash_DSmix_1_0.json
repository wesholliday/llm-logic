However, Premise 2 only states it's *possible* the flugel is not zargled, not that it *definitely* is not zargled. \n4. **Conclusion:** We cannot definitively infer that the flugel is blimmed. It's possible the flugel is both blimmed and zargled, or it's possible the flugel is neither.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
