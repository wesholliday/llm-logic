It means one of the two options must be true, but not both.\n3. **Combining the premises:** If the zinger might not be smoogled (premise 1), then it's possible it's not smoogled. Since premise 2 states that either it's smoogled or fraggled, and it might not be smoogled, then it must be fraggled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
