It means one of the two things must be true, but not both.\n3. **Combining the premises:** If the dreb is not spened (as suggested by premise 1), then according to premise 2, it must be vroombed. \n4. **However:** Premise 1 doesn't definitively state that the dreb is not spened. It only says it *might* not be. Therefore, it's possible the dreb is spened, in which case it wouldn't be vroombed.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
