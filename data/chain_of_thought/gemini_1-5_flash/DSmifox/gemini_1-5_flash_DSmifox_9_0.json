It means one of the two options must be true, but not both.\n3. **Combining the premises:** If the twonk might not be plinked, then the first part of premise 2 (\"the twonk must be plinked\") is not necessarily true. \n4. **Conclusion:** Since the first part of premise 2 is not necessarily true, the second part (\"it is varnished\") must be true to satisfy the exclusive OR condition.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
