It means one of the two options must be true, but not both.\n\n3. **Reasoning:** If the clug is not snugged (as suggested by Premise 1), then according to Premise 2, it must be fleeked. However, Premise 1 doesn't definitively state that the clug is not snugged. It only says it *might* not be.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** We cannot definitively infer that \"The clug is fleeked\" based on the given premises. It's possible the clug is snugged, in which case it wouldn't be fleeked.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
