It means one of the two options must be true, but not both.\n3. **Combining the premises:** If the grommet might not be plopped, then the first part of premise 2 (\"the grommet must be plopped\") is false. \n4. **Conclusion:** Since premise 2 is an exclusive OR, and the first part is false, the second part (\"it is sploffed\") must be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
