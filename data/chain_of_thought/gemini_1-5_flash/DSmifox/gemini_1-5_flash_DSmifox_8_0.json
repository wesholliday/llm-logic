It means one of the two options must be true, but not both.\n\n3. **Combining the premises:** If the sprocket might not be daggled, then it's possible it's not daggled.  Since the second premise says one of the two options (daggled or cranked) must be true, and it's possible the sprocket isn't daggled, then the sprocket must be cranked.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
