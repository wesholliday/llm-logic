It means one of the two options must be true, but not both.\n3. **Combining the premises:** If the flob is not motivated (as suggested by premise 1), then according to premise 2, it must be skizzled. \n4. **Conclusion:** Since it's possible the flob is not motivated, and if it's not motivated it must be skizzled, then we can infer that the flob is skizzled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
