It means one of the two options must be true, but not both.\n3. **Combining the premises:** If the smip might not be lupped (premise 1), then it's possible the smip is not lupped. Since the second premise states that either the smip is lupped or shripped, and it's possible the smip is not lupped, then the smip must be shripped.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
