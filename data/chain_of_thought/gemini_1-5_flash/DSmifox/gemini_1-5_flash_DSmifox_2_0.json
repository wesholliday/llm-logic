It means one of the two options must be true, but not both.\n3. **Combining the premises:** If the wug might not be bimmed (premise 1), then it's possible it's not bimmed. Since the second premise states that either it's bimmed or flooped, and it might not be bimmed, then it must be flooped.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
