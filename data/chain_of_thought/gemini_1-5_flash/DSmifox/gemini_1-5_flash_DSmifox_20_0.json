It means one of the two options must be true, but not both.\n3. **Combining the premises:** If the fleeg might not be surned (premise 1), then it's possible it's not surned. Since the second premise states that either it's surned or bluttered, and it might not be surned, then it must be bluttered.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
