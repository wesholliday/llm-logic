It means one of the two options must be true, but not both.\n3. **Combining the premises:** If the wug might not be garpled, then it's possible it's not garpled. Since the second premise states that either it's garpled or sproinged, and it might not be garpled, then it must be sproinged.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
