It means one of the two options must be true, but not both.\n\n3. **Combining the premises:** If the whiffle might not be tinked, then it's possible that the whiffle is not tinked.  Since the second premise states that either the whiffle is tinked or shanked, and it's possible the whiffle is not tinked, then the only remaining possibility is that the whiffle is shanked.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
