It means one of the two options must be true, but not both.\n\n3. **Combining the premises:** If the whiffle might not be tinked (premise 1), then it's possible it's not tinked.  Since the second premise states that either it's shanked or it must be tinked, and it's possible it's not tinked, then it must be shanked.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
