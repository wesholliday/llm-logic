It means one of the two options must be true, but not both.\n3. **Combining the premises:** If the wug might not be bimmed (premise 1), then it cannot be the case that \"it must be bimmed\" (part of premise 2). \n4. **Conclusion:** Since the \"it must be bimmed\" option is ruled out, the only remaining possibility from premise 2 is that \"the wug is flooped.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
