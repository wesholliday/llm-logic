It means one of the following must be true:\n    * The shank is plooked.\n    * The shank is nugged.\n\n3. **Combining the premises:**  If the shank is not nugged (as suggested by Premise 1), then according to Premise 2, it must be plooked.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** We can infer that the shank is plooked.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
