It means one of two things must be true: either the flugel is blimmed, or it is zargled.\n\n3. **Combining the premises:**  We know from premise 1 that the flugel *might not* be zargled. This means the second part of premise 2 (that it *must* be zargled) is potentially false. \n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the second part of premise 2 is potentially false, the only way to make the statement true is if the first part is true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The flugel is blimmed.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
