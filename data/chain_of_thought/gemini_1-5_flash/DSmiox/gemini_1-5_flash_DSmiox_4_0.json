It means one of the two options must be true, but not both.\n\n3. **Combining the premises:** If the fribble might not be crinked, then based on premise 2, it must be snurgled.  This is because the statement \"it must be crinked\" is ruled out by the possibility that the fribble might not be crinked.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
