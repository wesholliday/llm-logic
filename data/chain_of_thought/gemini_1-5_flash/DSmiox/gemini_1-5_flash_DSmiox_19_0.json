It means one of the two options is true, but not both.\n\n3. **Reasoning:** If the smonk is not plagged (as suggested by Premise 1), then according to Premise 2, it must be vreebled. However, Premise 1 doesn't definitively state that the smonk is not plagged, only that it might not be.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** We cannot definitively infer that \"The smonk is vreebled\" based on the given premises. It's possible the smonk is plagged, which would make the statement \"The smonk is vreebled\" false.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
