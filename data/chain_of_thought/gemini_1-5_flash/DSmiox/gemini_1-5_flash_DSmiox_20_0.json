It means one of the two options must be true, but not both.\n3. **Combining the premises:** If the fleeg might not be surned (premise 1), then it cannot be surned. This is because the \"might not\" implies a possibility of not being surned.\n4. **Applying premise 2:** Since the fleeg cannot be surned, the only remaining option from premise 2 is that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
