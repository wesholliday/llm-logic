There could be other possibilities.\n\n2. **The inference:** \"The flob might not have been skizzled.\" This statement is consistent with the original statement. If the flob doesn't *have* to be skizzled, it's possible it wasn't.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** Since the inference is consistent with the original statement, we can infer it.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
