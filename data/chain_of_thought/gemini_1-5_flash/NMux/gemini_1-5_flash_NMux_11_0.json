So, the original statement says it's not certain that the flug was blummed.\n3. **What does \"might not\" imply?** \"Might not\" implies possibility. It leaves open the chance that the flug was blummed, but it doesn't rule it out.\n4. **Connecting the dots:** Since the original statement says it's not certain the flug was blummed, it leaves open the possibility that it wasn't. This aligns with the meaning of \"might not.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
