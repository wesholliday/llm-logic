It says that the vampire being awake is a sufficient condition for the mummy being awake.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\" This negates the consequent of the conditional statement in premise 1.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"The vampire was not awake.\" This negates the antecedent of the conditional statement in premise 1.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThis argument follows the pattern of **Modus Tollens**, a valid argument form. Modus Tollens states:\n\n* If P, then Q.\n* Not Q.\n* Therefore, not P.\n\nIn our case:\n\n* P = The vampire was awake\n* Q = The mummy must have been awake\n\nSince the argument matches the Modus Tollens form, it is logically valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
