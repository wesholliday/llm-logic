This form looks like:\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * Not Q.\n    * Therefore, not P.\n\n2. **Analyze the premises and conclusion:**\n    * **Premise 1:** \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" This is our \"If P, then Q\" statement.\n    * **Premise 2:** \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\" This is our \"Not Q\" statement.\n    * **Conclusion:** \"The car was not red.\" This is our \"Not P\" statement.\n\n3. **Determine if the argument is valid:** Modus tollens is a **logically valid** argument form. This means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
