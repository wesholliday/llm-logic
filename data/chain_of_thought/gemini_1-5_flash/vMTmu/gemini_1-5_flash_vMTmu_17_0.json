This is a classic example of **modus tollens**.\n\n2. **Modus Tollens:** Modus tollens is a valid argument form. It states that if a conditional statement is true and its consequent is false, then its antecedent must also be false.\n\n3. **Apply to the argument:**\n    * The conditional statement is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\"\n    * The negation of the consequent is \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad.\"\n    * The conclusion is \"Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the argument follows the valid form of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
