            "content": "Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the argument's form:** This argument is a classic example of *modus tollens*.  Modus tollens has the following structure:\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * Not Q.\n    * Therefore, not P.\n\n2. **Apply the structure to the argument:**\n    * P: The griffin was in the forest.\n    * Q: The unicorn must have been in the forest.\n\n3. **Analyze the premises and conclusion:**\n    * The first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n    * The second premise states that it's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n    * The conclusion states that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\n4. **Determine validity:** Modus tollens is a logically valid argument form. If the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
