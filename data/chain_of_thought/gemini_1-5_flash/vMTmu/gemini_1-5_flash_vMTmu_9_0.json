            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the argument's form:** The argument is a classic example of *modus tollens*. This form looks like:\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * Not Q.\n    * Therefore, not P.\n\n2. **Analyze the premises and conclusion:**\n    * **Premise 1:** \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"  This sets up a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt (P) and Mark buying the blue shirt (Q).\n    * **Premise 2:** \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This directly negates the consequent (Q) of the conditional statement in premise 1.\n    * **Conclusion:** \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" This negates the antecedent (P) of the conditional statement in premise 1.\n\n3. **Determine if the argument is valid:**  *Modus tollens* is a logically valid argument form. If the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
