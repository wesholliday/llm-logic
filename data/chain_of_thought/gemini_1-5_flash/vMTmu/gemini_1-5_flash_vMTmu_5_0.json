            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the argument's form:** The argument is a classic example of *modus tollens*. This form looks like:\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * Not Q.\n    * Therefore, not P.\n\n2. **Analyze the premises and conclusion:**\n    * **Premise 1:** \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\" This establishes a conditional relationship between Jeff playing basketball (P) and Amy playing tennis (Q).\n    * **Premise 2:** \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\" This directly negates the consequent (Q) of the conditional statement in premise 1.\n    * **Conclusion:** \"Jeff did not play basketball.\" This negates the antecedent (P) of the conditional statement in premise 1.\n\n3. **Determine if the argument is valid:**  *Modus tollens* is a logically valid argument form. If the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
