            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the argument's form:** The argument uses the form of *modus tollens*. This form is:\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * Not Q.\n    * Therefore, not P.\n\n2. **Identifying the components:**\n    * P: Sam took a plane.\n    * Q: Erin must have taken a train.\n\n3. **Analyzing the premises:**\n    * The first premise states \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\" This aligns with the \"If P, then Q\" structure.\n    * The second premise states \"It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\" This aligns with the \"Not Q\" structure.\n\n4. **Evaluating the conclusion:**\n    * The conclusion states \"Sam did not take a plane.\" This aligns with the \"Therefore, not P\" structure.\n\n5. **Determining validity:**  *Modus tollens* is a logically valid argument form. This means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
