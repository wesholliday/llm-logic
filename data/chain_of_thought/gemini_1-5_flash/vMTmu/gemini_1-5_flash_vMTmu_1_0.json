This form of argument has the following structure:\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * Not Q.\n    * Therefore, not P.\n\n2. **Apply the form to the given argument:**\n    * P: Mary was at the wedding.\n    * Q: Sue must have been at the wedding.\n    * Not Q: It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\n    * Not P: Mary was not at the wedding.\n\n3. **Determine if the argument is valid:**  Modus tollens is a logically valid argument form. This means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
