This is a classic example of *modus tollens*.\n\n2. **Understand modus tollens:** Modus tollens is a valid argument form. It states that if a conditional statement is true and its consequent is false, then its antecedent must also be false.\n\n3. **Apply modus tollens to the argument:**\n    * The conditional statement is \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\"\n    * The negation of the consequent is \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\"\n    * The conclusion is \"The cake was not chocolate.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the argument follows the form of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
