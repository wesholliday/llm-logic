            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the premises:**\n   - Premise 1: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\" This is a conditional statement.\n   - Premise 2: \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\" This negates the consequent of the conditional statement in premise 1.\n\n2. **Applying the rule of Modus Tollens:**\n   - Modus Tollens is a valid argument form that states: If P then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n   - Our premises match this form:\n      - P: Sue chose pizza\n      - Q: Bob must have chosen pasta\n      - Not Q: It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since our premises fit the Modus Tollens form, the conclusion \"Sue did not choose pizza\" is logically valid.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
