            "content": "Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the argument's form:** This argument is a classic example of *modus tollens*.  Modus tollens has the following structure:\n    * If P, then Q.\n    * Not Q.\n    * Therefore, not P.\n\n2. **Apply the structure to the argument:**\n    * P: The bear was in the cave.\n    * Q: The wolf must have been in the den.\n\n3. **Analyze the premises and conclusion:**\n    * The first premise states that if the bear was in the cave (P), then the wolf must have been in the den (Q).\n    * The second premise states that the wolf was *not* in the den (not Q).\n    * The conclusion states that the bear was not in the cave (not P).\n\n4. **Determine validity:** Modus tollens is a logically valid argument form. If the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
