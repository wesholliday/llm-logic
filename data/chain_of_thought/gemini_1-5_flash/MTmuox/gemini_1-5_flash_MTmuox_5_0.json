Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n\n4. **Matching the form:** In our case, P is \"The zinger was fraggled\" and Q is \"The zinger was smoogled.\" We know from Premise 1 that Q is false (the zinger was not smoogled).\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Therefore, by Modus Tollens, we can infer that P is also false. This means \"The zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
