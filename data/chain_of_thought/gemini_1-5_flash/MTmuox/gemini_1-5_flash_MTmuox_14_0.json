The contrapositive of premise 2 is \"If the clug was not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked.\"\n4. **Combining premises:** Since we know from premise 1 that the clug might not have been snugged, and the contrapositive of premise 2 tells us that if the clug wasn't snugged, it wasn't fleeked, we can infer that the clug was not fleeked.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
