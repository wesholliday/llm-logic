It tells us that if the twonk was plinked, then it was definitely varnished.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished (Premise 2). However, we know that the twonk might not have been varnished (Premise 1). Therefore, the twonk cannot have been plinked.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
