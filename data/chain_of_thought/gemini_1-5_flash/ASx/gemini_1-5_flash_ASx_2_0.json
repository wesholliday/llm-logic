It means that if the first part (crinking the snoogle) is true, then the second part (plooming a nurp) is also true.\n\n2. **The new statement:** \"If we crink the snoogle and a wug zites, then we'll plook a nurp.\" This statement adds a new condition: \"a wug zites.\"\n\n3. **Reasoning:** The original statement only tells us what happens if we crink the snoogle. It doesn't say anything about what happens if a wug zites. Therefore, we can't infer anything about the outcome if a wug zites, even if we also crink the snoogle.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
