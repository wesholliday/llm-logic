It tells us that if the ploofle is blorped, a certain consequence (the fliggle getting a nurple) will follow.\n\n2. **The new statement:** \"If the ploofle is blorped and zooned, then the fliggle will get a nurple.\" This statement adds an extra condition (\"and zooned\") to the original statement.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  The original statement only guarantees the consequence if the ploofle is blorped. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the ploofle is also zooned.  The new statement is essentially saying that the fliggle will get a nurple even if the ploofle is also zooned, but the original statement doesn't provide enough information to confirm this.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
