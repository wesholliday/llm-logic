It tells us that if the klank is hooped, then the wuggy will definitely zink. \n\n2. **New statement:** \"If the klank is hooped and the wuggy is out of zloat, then the wuggy will zink.\" This statement adds an extra condition: the wuggy being out of zloat.\n\n3. **Reasoning:** The original statement only tells us about the klank being hooped. It doesn't say anything about the wuggy being out of zloat.  The new statement is essentially saying that the wuggy will zink if the klank is hooped, regardless of whether the wuggy is out of zloat or not.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the original statement doesn't provide information about the wuggy's zloat status, we cannot infer the new statement.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
