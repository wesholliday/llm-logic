It tells us that if the glop is on the brink, the skrizzle is definitely plonked. \n\n2. **The new statement:** \"If the glop is on the brink and the bloop is zorped, then the skrizzle is plonked.\" This statement adds a new condition: the bloop being zorped.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  The original statement only tells us about the glop being on the brink. It doesn't say anything about the bloop or its zorped state.  Therefore, the new statement is not necessarily true based on the original statement.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
