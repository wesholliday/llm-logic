            "content": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the original statement:** The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the plim is grobbled, then the whiffle will sploosh.\" This means that if the plim is grobbled, the whiffle *must* sploosh. \n\n2. **Analyzing the new statement:** The new statement is also a conditional statement: \"If the plim is grobbled and the drazzle is drooped, then the whiffle will sploosh.\"  This statement adds an extra condition: the drazzle must be drooped.\n\n3. **Applying logic:**  The original statement tells us that grobbling the plim *guarantees* the whiffle will sploosh.  The new statement adds a condition (the drazzle being drooped) but doesn't change the fact that the plim being grobbled is still the key factor. \n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the plim being grobbled is the only condition needed for the whiffle to sploosh, the new statement can be inferred from the original.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
