It means that if the snark is blimmed, then flooping is a guaranteed outcome.\n\n2. **New statement:** \"If the snark was blimmed and sproinged, then it flooped.\" This statement adds an extra condition: the snark must also be sproinged.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  The original statement only guarantees flooping if the snark is blimmed. It doesn't say anything about what happens if the snark is also sproinged.  The new statement is trying to extend the original statement's conclusion to a new situation.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** We cannot infer the new statement from the original statement. The original statement doesn't provide enough information to know what happens when the snark is both blimmed and sproinged.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
