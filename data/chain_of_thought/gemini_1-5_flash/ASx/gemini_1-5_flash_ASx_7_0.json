It tells us that if the tizzer is on, the goom *must* be snurpled. \n\n2. **The new statement:** \"If the tizzer is on and the plink light is out, then the goom is snurpled.\" This statement adds a new condition (the plink light being out) to the original statement.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  The original statement only tells us about the tizzer being on. It doesn't say anything about the plink light.  Therefore, the new statement is not necessarily true.  The plink light's state could be irrelevant to the goom being snurpled.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
