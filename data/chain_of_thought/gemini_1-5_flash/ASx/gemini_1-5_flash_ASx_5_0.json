It tells us that if the klonk is fizzered, then the meeping will definitely nurple. \n\n2. **The new statement:** \"If the klonk is fizzered and the splat dangles, then the meeping will nurple.\" This statement adds a new condition: the splat must dangle.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  The original statement only requires the klonk to be fizzered for the meeping to nurple. The new statement adds an extra condition (the splat dangling).  Since the original statement doesn't say anything about the splat, we can't infer that the meeping will nurple just because the splat dangles.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
