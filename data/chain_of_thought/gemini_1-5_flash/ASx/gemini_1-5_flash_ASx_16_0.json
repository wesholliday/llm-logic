It tells us that if the trankle is sploofed, then the zorple will definitely quibble. \n\n2. **The new statement:** \"If the trankle is sploofed and the drib is flanked, then the zorple will quibble.\" This statement adds a new condition: the drib being flanked.\n\n3. **Reasoning:** The original statement only requires the trankle to be sploofed for the zorple to quibble. The new statement adds an extra condition (the drib being flanked) but doesn't change the outcome (the zorple quibbling).  Since the original statement already guarantees the zorple will quibble if the trankle is sploofed, adding another condition doesn't change that outcome.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
