It tells us that if the plink morphs, then tizzling is a guaranteed outcome.\n\n2. **The new statement:** \"If the plink has morphed and it was misglommed, then it will tizzle.\" This statement adds a new condition: the plink must have been misglommed.\n\n3. **Reasoning:** The original statement only requires the plink to morph for tizzling to occur. The new statement adds an extra condition (being misglommed).  Since the original statement doesn't say anything about misglomming, we can't infer that it's necessary for tizzling.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
