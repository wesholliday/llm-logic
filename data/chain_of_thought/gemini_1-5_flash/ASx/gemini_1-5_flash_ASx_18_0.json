It means that if the zonk is twiddled, pluzzling is guaranteed. \n\n2. **New statement:** \"If the zonk is twiddled and it is blorped, then it will pluzzle.\" This statement adds an extra condition (being blorped) to the original statement.\n\n3. **Reasoning:** The original statement only requires the zonk to be twiddled for it to pluzzle.  The new statement adds the condition of being blorped.  Since the original statement doesn't say anything about blorping, we can't infer that blorping is necessary for pluzzling.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
