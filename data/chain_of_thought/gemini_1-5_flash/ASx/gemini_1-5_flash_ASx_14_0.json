It means that if the frizzle is dinked, the zarp *must* splunk. \n\n2. **New statement:** \"If the frizzle is dinked and the sklonk is grooped, then the zarp will splunk.\" This statement adds a new condition: the sklonk being grooped.\n\n3. **Reasoning:** The original statement only requires the frizzle to be dinked for the zarp to splunk. The new statement adds an extra condition.  Since the original statement doesn't say anything about the sklonk, the new condition doesn't affect the outcome. If the frizzle is dinked, the zarp will splunk regardless of the sklonk's state.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
