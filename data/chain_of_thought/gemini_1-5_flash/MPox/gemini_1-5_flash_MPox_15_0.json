It tells us that if the first part is true (the dreb was vroombed), then the second part must also be true (the dreb was spened).\n3. **Applying the conditional:** Since we know from Premise 1 that the dreb was vroombed, and Premise 2 tells us that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was spened, we can conclude that the dreb was spened.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
