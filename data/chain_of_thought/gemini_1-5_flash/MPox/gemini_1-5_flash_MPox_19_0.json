It says that if the first part (the smonk being vreebled) is true, then the second part (the smonk plagged) must also be true.\n3. **Inference:** Since we know the first part of the conditional statement (Premise 1) is true, we can infer that the second part (the smonk plagged) is also true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
