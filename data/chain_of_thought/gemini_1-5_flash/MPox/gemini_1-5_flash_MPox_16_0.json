It says that if the first part (the sneg being crampled) is true, then the second part (the sneg sproting the frink) must also be true.\n3. **Inference:** Since we know the first part of the conditional statement (the sneg being crampled) is true, we can infer that the second part (the sneg sproting the frink) is also true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
