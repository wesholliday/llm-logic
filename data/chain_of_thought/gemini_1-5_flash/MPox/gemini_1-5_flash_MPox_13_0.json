It tells us that if the first part is true (the glip was slogged), then the second part must also be true (the glip was tragged).\n3. **Applying the premises:** Since we know premise 1 is true, and premise 2 states that if premise 1 is true, then premise 2's consequent must also be true, we can conclude that the glip was tragged.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
