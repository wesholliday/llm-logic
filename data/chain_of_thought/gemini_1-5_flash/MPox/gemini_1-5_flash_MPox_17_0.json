It tells us that if the first part (the flob was skizzled) is true, then the second part (the flob movated) must also be true.\n3. **Applying the conditional:** Since we know the first part of the conditional statement (the flob was skizzled) is true, we can conclude that the second part (the flob movated) must also be true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
