It says that if the first part (the grommet was sploffed) is true, then the second part (the grommet plopped the frink) must also be true.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since Premise 1 tells us the first part of the conditional statement is true, we can infer that the second part is also true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
