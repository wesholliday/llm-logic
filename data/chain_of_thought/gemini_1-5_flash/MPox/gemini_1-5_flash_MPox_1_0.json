It states that if the first part (the flugel being blimmed) is true, then the second part (the flugel being zargled) must also be true.\n3. **Applying the premises:** Since we know the first part of the conditional statement (Premise 1) is true, and the conditional statement itself is true (Premise 2), we can conclude that the second part of the conditional statement must also be true. \n4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we can infer that \"The flugel was zargled.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
