It says that if the first part is true (the wug was sproinged), then the second part must also be true (it was garpled).\n3. **Applying the conditional:** Since we know from Premise 1 that the wug was sproinged, and Premise 2 tells us that if the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled, we can conclude that the wug was garpled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
