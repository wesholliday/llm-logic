It states that if the first part (the flug was blummed) is true, then the second part (the flug was zimmed) must also be true.\n3. **Applying the conditional:** Since we know premise 1 is true (the flug was blummed), and premise 2 is a conditional statement where the first part is true, we can conclude that the second part of the conditional statement must also be true. \n4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we can infer that \"The flug was zimmed.\"\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
