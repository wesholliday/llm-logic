It says that if the first part (the zinger being fraggled) is true, then the second part (the zinger being smoogled) must also be true.\n\n3. **Applying the premises:** Since we know from Premise 1 that the zinger was fraggled, and Premise 2 tells us that if the zinger was fraggled, then it was smoogled, we can conclude that the zinger was smoogled.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
