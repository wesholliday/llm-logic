It tells us that if the first part is true (the fleeg was bluttered), then the second part must also be true (it surned).\n3. **Applying the conditional:** Since we know the first part of the conditional statement (Premise 1) is true, we can conclude that the second part must also be true. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
