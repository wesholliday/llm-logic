It states that if the first part (the wug was flooped) is true, then the second part (the wug bimmed the zoint) must also be true.\n3. **Applying Modus Ponens:**  Modus Ponens is a valid argument form in logic. It states that if we have a conditional statement (like premise 2) and we know the first part of the conditional is true (like premise 1), then we can infer that the second part of the conditional is also true.\n\n**Therefore, we can infer that \"The wug bimmed the zoint.\"**\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
