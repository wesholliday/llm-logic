            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The gribble must be flim on snork and it must blimple quazzle flim\" is a conjunction of two statements: \"The gribble must be flim on snork\" and \"it must blimple quazzle flim\".  The second statement is redundant, as it is already implied by the first statement.  Therefore, the second statement can be removed without changing the meaning of the original statement.  This leaves us with \"The gribble must be flim on snork and blimple quazzle flim\".  Since the original statement implies the new statement, we can infer the new statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
