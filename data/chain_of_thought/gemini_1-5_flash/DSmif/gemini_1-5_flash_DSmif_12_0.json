It means that one and only one of the options is true. \n2. **Premise 2:** \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\" This statement implies that the jacket might be in the closet, but it doesn't definitively rule it out. \n3. **Inference:**  Since the jacket might not be in the closet, it's possible that the other option in the exclusive disjunction (being draped over the chair) is true. However, it's also possible that the jacket is in a different location entirely. \n\n**Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.**\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
