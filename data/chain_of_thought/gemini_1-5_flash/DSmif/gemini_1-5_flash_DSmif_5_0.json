This means that at least one of the two parts must be true. \n2. **The second statement:** \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry\" tells us that the first part of the disjunctive statement is false.\n3. **Inference:** Since the first part is false, the second part of the disjunctive statement must be true. This means \"The cookies are in the jar\" is true.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
