It could be true, but it also could be false.\n\n3. **Inference:** Since the first possibility is not necessarily true, the second possibility (sunglasses in her bag) must be true. If the sunglasses are not on her head, and they must be in one of the two places, then they must be in her bag.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
