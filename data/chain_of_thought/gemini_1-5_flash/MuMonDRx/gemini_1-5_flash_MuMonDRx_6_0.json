The statement \"The zibber must be bimboozle or fizzle zibber\" tells us that the zibber must be in either the state of \"bimboozle\" or the state of \"fizzle zibber\". Since the first statement already establishes that the zibber must be in the state of \"fizzle zibber\", it logically follows that it also satisfies the condition of being \"bimboozle or fizzle zibber\".\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
