The statement \"The snorkel must be quorple or glorp zizz\" allows for the possibility that the snorkel is quorple, but it also includes the possibility that it is glorp zizz. Since the first statement tells us the snorkel *must* be glorp zizz, it is a more specific and definitive statement than the second. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
