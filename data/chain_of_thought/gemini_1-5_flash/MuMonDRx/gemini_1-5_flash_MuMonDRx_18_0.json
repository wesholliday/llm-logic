The statement \"The fizzle must be on an quank gribble or zazzle with gronk\"  says that the fizzle must either be on a quank gribble or be zazzle with gronk. Since being zazzle with gronk is already a requirement, it is possible that the fizzle is both on a quank gribble and zazzle with gronk. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
