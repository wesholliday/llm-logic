            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The zazzle must be wobble crunk zibber\" implies that the zazzle has to be both \"wobble crunk\" and \"zibber\".  The statement \"The zazzle must be zibber or wobble crunk zibber\" allows for the zazzle to be only \"zibber\" and not necessarily \"wobble crunk\". Since the first statement is more restrictive than the second, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes \n"
