The statement \"The flim must be crunk or wumble a plonk\" tells us that the flim must satisfy either the condition of being \"crunk\" or the condition of being \"wumble a plonk\". Since the first statement already establishes that the flim must be \"wumble a plonk\", it logically follows that it also satisfies the second statement. \n\nAnswer: yes \n"
