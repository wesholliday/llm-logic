The statement \"The fizzle must be froodle or zizz by zooble\" implies that the fizzle being either froodle or zizz is a necessary condition for it to be by zooble. Since the first statement only requires the fizzle to be zizz, it doesn't necessarily imply that it must also be froodle. \n\nAnswer: no \n"
