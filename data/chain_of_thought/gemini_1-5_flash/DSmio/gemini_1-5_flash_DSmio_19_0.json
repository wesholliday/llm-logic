This leaves us with the other possibility from premise 2: the watch is charging on the dresser. \n4. **Inference:**  Since the watch might not be on his wrist, and the only other possibility is that it's charging on the dresser, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
