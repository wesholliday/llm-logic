It doesn't say anything about the bear being in the cave if the wolf is in the den. \n4. **It's possible that the wolf was in the den for another reason.** Maybe the wolf was in the den because it was raining, or because it was hungry. The wolf being in the den doesn't automatically mean the bear was there.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
