In our case, if the vampire was awake (P) and the mummy was not awake (Q), then the statement would be false.\n\n3. **Applying the information:** Since we know the mummy was awake (Statement 2), the conditional statement (Statement 1) could be true even if the vampire was asleep.  The conditional statement doesn't guarantee the vampire was awake, it only states what would happen *if* the vampire was awake.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
