This is a conditional statement.\n2. **The second given statement:** \"The cat was outside\" is true. This is the consequent of the conditional statement.\n3. **The question:** Does it necessarily follow that \"The dog was inside\" is true? This is asking if the antecedent of the conditional statement is also true.\n4. **Reasoning:**  A conditional statement is only false if the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. Since the consequent is true in this case, the conditional statement could be true even if the antecedent is false. \n5. **Example:** Imagine a scenario where the dog is outside and the cat is outside. The conditional statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" would still be true, even though the dog is not inside.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
