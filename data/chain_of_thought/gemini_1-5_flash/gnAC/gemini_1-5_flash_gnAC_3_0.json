In our case, if the book was written by James (P) and it's not a mystery novel (Q), then the conditional statement would be false.\n\n3. **Applying the information:** Since we know the book is a mystery novel (Q is true), the conditional statement (Statement 1) could be true regardless of whether James wrote the book (P). \n\n4. **Possible scenarios:**\n    * **Scenario 1:** James wrote the book (P is true). This satisfies the conditional statement.\n    * **Scenario 2:** Someone else wrote the book (P is false). This also satisfies the conditional statement because the second part (Q) is true.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** We cannot definitively conclude that James wrote the book. The fact that the book is a mystery novel doesn't necessarily mean James wrote it.\n\n**Answer: no** \n"
