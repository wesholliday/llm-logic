It says that if the apple was red, then the banana *must* be yellow.\n\n3. **Reasoning:**  We know from Premise 1 that the banana doesn't *have* to be yellow.  Since Premise 2 states that a red apple *requires* a yellow banana, the apple cannot have been red. If it were, the banana would have to be yellow, contradicting Premise 1.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
