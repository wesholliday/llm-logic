The contrapositive of premise 2 is \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\"\n4. **Combining premises:** Since we know from premise 1 that the robot might not have visited Jupiter, we can apply the contrapositive from step 3. \n5. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
