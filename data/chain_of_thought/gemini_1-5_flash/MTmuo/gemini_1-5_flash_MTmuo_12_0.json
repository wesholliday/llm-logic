It tells us that Joe going to the park is a sufficient condition for Lucy going to the zoo.\n3. **Combining the premises:**  Since we know Lucy might not have gone to the zoo (from premise 1), and Joe going to the park would require Lucy to have gone to the zoo (from premise 2), we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
