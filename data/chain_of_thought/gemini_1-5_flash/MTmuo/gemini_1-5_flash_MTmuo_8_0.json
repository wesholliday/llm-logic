It tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy *must* have been awake.\n3. **Reasoning:**  Since we know the mummy didn't *have* to be awake (from Premise 1), and the vampire being awake would require the mummy to be awake (from Premise 2), then the vampire cannot have been awake. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
