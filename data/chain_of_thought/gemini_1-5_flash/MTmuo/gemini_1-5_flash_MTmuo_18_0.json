The contrapositive of Premise 2 is \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\"\n\n4. **Combining Premise 1 and the contrapositive:** Since we know the truck could have been made of something other than metal (Premise 1), and the contrapositive tells us that if the truck wasn't metal, the doll wasn't plastic, we can conclude that the doll was not plastic.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
