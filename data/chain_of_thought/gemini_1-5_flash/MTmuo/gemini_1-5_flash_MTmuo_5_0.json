It says that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy *definitely* played tennis.\n3. **Combining the premises:**  We know from premise 1 that Amy might not have played tennis.  Since premise 2 states that if Jeff played basketball, Amy *must* have played tennis, then Jeff cannot have played basketball.  If he had, it would contradict premise 1.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
