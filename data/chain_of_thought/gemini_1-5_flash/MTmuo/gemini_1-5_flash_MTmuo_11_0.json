The contrapositive of premise 2 is \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\"\n\n4. **Combining premises:** Since we know from premise 1 that the muffins might not have been blueberry, we can apply the contrapositive from step 3. \n\n5. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
