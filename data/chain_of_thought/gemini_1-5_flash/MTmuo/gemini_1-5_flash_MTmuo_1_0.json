It tells us that Mary's presence at the wedding implies Sue's presence.\n3. **Combining the premises:**  Since we know Sue might not have been at the wedding (from premise 1), and Mary's presence would require Sue's presence (from premise 2), we can conclude that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
