It means that if Tom watched football, then Jen definitely watched basketball.\n3. **Combining the premises:**  Since we know Jen might not have watched basketball (from premise 1), and the second premise states that if Tom watched football, Jen *must* have watched basketball, then Tom cannot have watched football. \n\n**Answer: yes** \n"
