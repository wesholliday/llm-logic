(Fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter. But we don't know for sure if the alien visited Mars.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the robot indeed visited Jupiter. However, this fact alone does not provide direct evidence about the alien's visit to Mars.\n\nSince we don't have any direct information about the alien's visit to Mars, we cannot infer that the alien visited Mars solely based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
