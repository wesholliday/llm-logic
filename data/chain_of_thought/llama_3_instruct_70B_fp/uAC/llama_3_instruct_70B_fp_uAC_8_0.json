(This is a conditional statement, implying that if the vampire is awake, the mummy must also be awake.)\n2. The mummy was awake. (This is a direct statement, telling us that the mummy is indeed awake.)\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince the mummy is awake (from statement 2), and we know that if the vampire is awake, the mummy must also be awake (from statement 1), we can infer that the vampire being awake is a possible scenario that would lead to the mummy being awake.\n\nHowever, there might be other scenarios where the mummy is awake without the vampire being awake. The conditional statement only guarantees that if the vampire is awake, the mummy will be awake, but it doesn't imply that the mummy being awake necessarily means the vampire is awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
