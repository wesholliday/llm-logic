We are told that \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This implies that if James wrote the book, it must be a mystery novel. However, it does not necessarily mean that if the book is a mystery novel, it was written by James. There could be other authors who write mystery novels as well.\n\nWe are also told that \"the book is a mystery novel.\" This confirms that the book indeed belongs to the mystery novel genre. However, this information alone does not provide any direct connection between the book being a mystery novel and James being the author.\n\nGiven the information, we cannot conclude that the book was written by James simply because it is a mystery novel. There might be other authors who wrote mystery novels, and we lack specific evidence linking James to this particular book.\n\nAnswer: no",
