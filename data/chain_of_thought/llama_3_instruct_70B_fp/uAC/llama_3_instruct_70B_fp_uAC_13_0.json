(Fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. However, this implication does not guarantee that the car is red. It only establishes a conditional relationship between the car's color and the truck's color.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the truck is indeed blue. But this fact alone does not provide direct evidence about the car's color.\n\nWe cannot infer that the car was red solely based on the given statements. The implication in statement 1 only works in one direction: if the car is red, then the truck is blue. It does not imply that if the truck is blue, then the car must be red.\n\nAnswer: no",
