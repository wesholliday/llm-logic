The unicorn was in the forest. (Fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the griffin was in the forest, it would imply the unicorn was in the forest. However, this implication does not provide direct information about the griffin's location.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the unicorn was indeed in the forest. But this fact alone does not provide direct information about the griffin's location.\n\nTo infer that the griffin was in the forest, we would need additional information or a logical connection between the two statements. Unfortunately, we don't have that. The implication in statement 1 only works one way: if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. It does not guarantee that if the unicorn was in the forest, the griffin was also in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no",
