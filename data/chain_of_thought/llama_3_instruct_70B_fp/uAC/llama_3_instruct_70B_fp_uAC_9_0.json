            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given information step by step. We are told that \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\" or \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and B is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\". \n\nWe are also told that \"Mark bought the blue shirt\", which means that B is true. \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that Lisa bought the red shirt (A) based on the given information. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if B is true, it does not necessarily mean that A is true. There could be other reasons why B is true. \n\nHowever, in this case, we are given the additional information that Mark bought the blue shirt, which is the consequence of Lisa buying the red shirt. \n\nBut, we still cannot conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt just because Mark bought the blue shirt. There could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt, unrelated to Lisa buying the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
