We are told that \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This implies that if Alex finished the race, it is a sufficient condition for Chris to have finished the race. However, it does not necessarily mean that if Chris finished the race, Alex must have finished the race.\n\nWe are also given the additional information that \"Chris finished the race.\" This tells us that Chris definitely finished the race. Now, we need to determine if we can infer that Alex finished the race.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. But we don't have any information that guarantees Alex finished the race. The fact that Chris finished the race does not necessarily imply that Alex finished the race, because Chris could have finished the race independently of Alex.\n\nAnswer: no",
