Erin took a train.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. This implies that if Sam took a plane, then the consequence (Erin took a train) must be true.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Erin took a train. This satisfies the consequence mentioned in statement 1. However, this does not necessarily mean that Sam took a plane. There could be other reasons why Erin took a train, not just because Sam took a plane.\n\nIn other words, the fact that Erin took a train does not provide enough information to conclude that Sam took a plane. We can only infer that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train, but we cannot infer the converse (i.e., if Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane).\n\nAnswer: no",
