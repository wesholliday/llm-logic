(This is a conditional statement, implying that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal.)\n2. The truck was metal. (This is a statement of fact, telling us that the truck is indeed metal.)\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. Statement 2 confirms that the truck is indeed metal. However, this does not necessarily mean that the doll is plastic. There could be other reasons why the truck is metal, unrelated to the doll's material.\n\nIn other words, the fact that the truck is metal does not provide enough information to conclude that the doll is plastic. We need more evidence or a stronger connection between the two statements to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
