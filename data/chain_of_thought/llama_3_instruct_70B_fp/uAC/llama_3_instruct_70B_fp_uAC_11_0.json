The muffins were blueberry.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. This is a conditional statement, and it does not provide any information about the cake being chocolate.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the muffins are indeed blueberry. Now, we can use this information to see if we can infer anything about the cake.\n\nSince the muffins are blueberry, and we know that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry, we can conclude that it is possible that the cake is chocolate. However, we cannot be certain that the cake is chocolate just because the muffins are blueberry. There might be other reasons why the muffins are blueberry.\n\nAnswer: no",
