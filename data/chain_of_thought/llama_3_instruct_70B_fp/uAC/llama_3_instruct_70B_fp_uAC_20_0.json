(Fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. But we don't know the color of the apple yet.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the banana is indeed yellow. Now, we can try to use this information to infer the color of the apple.\n\nSince the banana is yellow, and we know that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow, it seems like we can conclude that the apple is red. However, this is not necessarily the case.\n\nThe implication in statement 1 only guarantees that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. It does not guarantee that if the banana is yellow, then the apple must be red. There could be other reasons why the banana is yellow, unrelated to the apple's color.\n\nAnswer: no",
