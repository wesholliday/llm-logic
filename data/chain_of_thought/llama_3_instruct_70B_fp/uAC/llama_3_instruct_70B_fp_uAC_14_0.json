(This is a conditional statement, implying that if the bear is in the cave, it necessarily means the wolf is in the den.)\n2. The wolf was in the den. (This is a statement of fact, telling us that the wolf is indeed in the den.)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that the bear was in the cave. Since the wolf is in the den, it satisfies the condition in statement 1. However, this does not necessarily mean the bear was in the cave. There could be other reasons why the wolf is in the den, unrelated to the bear's location.\n\nAnswer: no",
