            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given information step by step. We are told that \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Mary \u2192 Sue\". This means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must also be at the wedding. However, it does not necessarily mean that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nWe are also told that \"Sue was at the wedding\". This is a separate piece of information that does not directly relate to Mary's presence at the wedding.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that Mary was at the wedding based on the given information. Since we know that Sue was at the wedding, and we have the conditional statement \"Mary \u2192 Sue\", we might be tempted to conclude that Mary was at the wedding. However, this would be a logical fallacy. The conditional statement only guarantees that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would also be at the wedding. It does not provide any information about Mary's presence at the wedding if we only know that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
