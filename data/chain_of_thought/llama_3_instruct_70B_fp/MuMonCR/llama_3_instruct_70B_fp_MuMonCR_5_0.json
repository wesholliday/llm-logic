            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for\". This statement implies that two events have occurred: the package was delivered today, and it was signed for. The question is whether we can infer that the package was signed for, based on this statement.\n\nTo answer this, let's break down the original statement. The \"and\" in the statement indicates that both events (delivery and signing) are connected and must have occurred together. If the package was delivered today, it must have been signed for, because the statement says it was delivered \"and\" signed for.\n\nAnswer: yes",
