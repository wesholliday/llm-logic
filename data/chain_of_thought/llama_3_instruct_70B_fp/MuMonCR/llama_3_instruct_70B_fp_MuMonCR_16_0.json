This statement is a conjunction of two clauses: \"The room must have been cleaned daily\" and \"had fresh towels\". In logic, when we have a conjunction of two clauses, we can infer that each individual clause is true. In this case, we can infer that \"had fresh towels\" is true, which means the room must have had fresh towels.\n\nAnswer: yes",
