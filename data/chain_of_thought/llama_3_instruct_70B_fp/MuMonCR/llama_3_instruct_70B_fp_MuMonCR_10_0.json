            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is \"The document must have been signed and notarized\". This implies that both signing and notarization are necessary conditions for the document. In other words, the document cannot be considered valid unless it has been both signed and notarized. \n\nFrom this, we can conclude that notarization is a required step, as the document cannot be valid without it. Therefore, we can infer that the document must have been notarized.\n\nAnswer: yes",
