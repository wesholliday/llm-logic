            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM and in the conference room\" implies that both conditions, the time being 2 PM and the location being the conference room, must be true. \n\nIf we break down the statement, we can see that it is a conjunction of two clauses: \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM\" and \"in the conference room\". \n\nSince the original statement is true, we can infer that both clauses are true individually. \n\nTherefore, we can conclude that \"The meeting must have been in the conference room\" is indeed true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
