The inference we're trying to make is \"The car must have needed repairs,\" which focuses only on the second condition.\n\nSince the original statement explicitly states that the car needed repairs, we can conclude that this condition is true regardless of the first condition (the car being in the garage). The fact that the car was in the garage doesn't affect the truth of the car needing repairs.\n\nAnswer: yes",
