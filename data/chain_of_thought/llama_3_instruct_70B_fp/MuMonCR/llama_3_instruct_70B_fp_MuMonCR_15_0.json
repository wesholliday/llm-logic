The question asks if we can infer that the password must have included a number. \n\nSince the original statement explicitly states that the password must include a number, we can directly conclude that the password must have included a number. The fact that the password must be eight characters long is an additional condition, but it does not affect the conclusion about the presence of a number.\n\nAnswer: yes",
