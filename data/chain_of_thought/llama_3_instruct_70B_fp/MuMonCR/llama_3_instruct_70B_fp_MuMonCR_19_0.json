            "content": "Explanation: The original statement mentions two conditions that must be met: the application must have been completed online, and it must have included references. These conditions are connected with \"and\", which implies that both conditions are necessary. \n\nIf we focus on the second condition, \"included references\", we can see that it is a necessary part of the original statement. The fact that the application must have been completed online does not affect the necessity of including references. \n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the application must have included references, regardless of whether it was completed online or not.\n\nAnswer: yes",
