            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a compound statement that contains two clauses: \"The concert must have been sold out\" and \"started at 8 PM\". The word \"and\" is used to connect these two clauses, indicating that both clauses are true. \n\nFrom this, we can infer that the concert started at 8 PM because it is one of the clauses in the original statement. The fact that the concert was sold out does not affect the start time of the concert.\n\nAnswer: yes",
