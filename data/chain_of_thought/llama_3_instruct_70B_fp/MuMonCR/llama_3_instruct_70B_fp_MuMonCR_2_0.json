This statement is a conjunction of two clauses: \"The book must have been on the shelf\" and \"had a red cover\". In logic, when we have a conjunction of two clauses, we can infer each individual clause separately. In this case, we can infer \"had a red cover\" from the original statement because it is one of the clauses in the conjunction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
