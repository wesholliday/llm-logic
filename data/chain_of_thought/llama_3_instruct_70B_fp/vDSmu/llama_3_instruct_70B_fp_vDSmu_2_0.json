            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion. The first premise is a disjunction, stating that either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table. The second premise negates the second disjunct, stating that it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table. \n\nFrom the second premise, we can infer that the book is not resting on the table. Since the first premise presents an either-or situation, and we know that the book is not resting on the table, we can conclude that the book must be on the shelf. This is a classic example of a disjunctive syllogism, where we eliminate one option and conclude that the other option must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
