This means that one of these two options must be true.\n\nThe second premise negates one of the options, stating that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head. This means that the only remaining option is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nThe conclusion then follows logically from the premises, as it asserts that the sunglasses are in her bag, which is the only remaining possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
