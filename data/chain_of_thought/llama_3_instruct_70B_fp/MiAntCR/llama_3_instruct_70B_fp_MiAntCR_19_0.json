It does not provide any information about how the application is completed, whether online or offline. The phrase \"might include references\" only focuses on the content of the application, not the method of completion.\n\nTo infer that the application might be completed online, we would need additional information or context that is not provided in the original statement. The original statement only talks about the possibility of references being included, but it does not give us any information about the platform or method used to complete the application.\n\nAnswer: no",
