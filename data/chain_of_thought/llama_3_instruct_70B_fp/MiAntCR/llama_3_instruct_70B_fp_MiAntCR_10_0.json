However, in many cases, notarization typically occurs after a document has been signed. But this is not a universal rule, and there might be scenarios where a document is notarized without being signed.\n\nGiven the lack of information about signing in the original statement, we cannot definitively conclude that the document might be signed and notarized based solely on the fact that it might be notarized.\n\nAnswer: no",
