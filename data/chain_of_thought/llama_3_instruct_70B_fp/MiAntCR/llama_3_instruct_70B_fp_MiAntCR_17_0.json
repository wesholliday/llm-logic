It does not mention anything about the report's accuracy. The phrase \"might be\" indicates a possibility, but it only applies to the submission time, not to the report's accuracy.\n\nTo infer \"The report might be accurate and be submitted by noon\", we would need additional information that suggests a connection between the report's accuracy and its submission time. However, the original statement does not provide such information.\n\nAnswer: no",
