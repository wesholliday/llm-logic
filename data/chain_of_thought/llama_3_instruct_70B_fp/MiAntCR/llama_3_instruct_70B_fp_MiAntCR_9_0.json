For example, the flight could be rerouted due to weather conditions or air traffic control issues, but still arrive at its original scheduled time.\n\nHowever, it is possible that a rerouted flight could also be delayed, as the new route might be longer or more complicated. But this is not a guarantee, and we cannot infer a delay solely from the fact that the flight might be rerouted.\n\nAnswer: no",
