            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"A \u2192 C\", where A is \"Alex finished the race\" and C is \"Chris finished the race\".\n2. \"Alex did not finish the race\" - This is a negation of the antecedent (A), which can be represented as \"\u00acA\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince A \u2192 C, we know that if A is true, then C must also be true. However, we are given that A is false (\u00acA). In this case, the conditional statement A \u2192 C does not provide any information about C, because the condition A is not met.\n\nHowever, we can use the contrapositive of the original statement, which is \"\u00acC \u2192 \u00acA\". This means that if Chris did not finish the race (\u00acC), then Alex did not finish the race (\u00acA). Since we know that \u00acA is true, we can infer that \u00acC must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
