            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\", which can be represented as \"V \u2192 M\", where V represents \"the vampire was awake\" and M represents \"the mummy was awake\". This statement implies that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake, but it does not provide any information about the mummy's state when the vampire is not awake.\n\nWe are also given the statement \"The vampire was not awake\", which can be represented as \"\u00acV\". Now, we need to determine if we can infer \"The mummy was not awake\", represented as \"\u00acM\".\n\nFrom the conditional statement \"V \u2192 M\", we know that if V is true, then M must also be true. However, we are given that V is false (\u00acV). In this case, the conditional statement \"V \u2192 M\" does not provide any information about M, as it only guarantees M's truth when V is true.\n\nTo infer \u00acM, we would need a statement that guarantees M's falsity when V is false. However, we do not have such a statement. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the mummy was not awake based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
