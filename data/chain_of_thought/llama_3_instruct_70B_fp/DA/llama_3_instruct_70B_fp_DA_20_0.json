We have a conditional statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\", which can be represented as \"If A, then B\". We also know that \"The apple was not red\", which means A is false.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n1. If A is true, then B must be true (by the conditional statement).\n2. But we know A is false. In this case, the conditional statement doesn't provide any information about B.\n\nSince the conditional statement only guarantees B when A is true, and A is actually false, we cannot make any conclusions about B. The truth value of B remains unknown.\n\nAnswer: no",
