            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"G \u2192 U\", where G represents \"the griffin was in the forest\" and U represents \"the unicorn was in the forest\".\n2. \"The griffin was not in the forest\" - This statement can be represented as \"\u00acG\", where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if G is true, then U must also be true. However, statement 2 tells us that G is actually false (\u00acG). Since the condition \"G\" is not met, we cannot directly conclude anything about U.\n\nHowever, we can use the concept of modus tollens, which states that if we have \"G \u2192 U\" and \"\u00acG\", we can infer \"\u00acU\". This is because if the condition \"G\" is not met, and the implication \"G \u2192 U\" is true, then the conclusion \"U\" cannot be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
