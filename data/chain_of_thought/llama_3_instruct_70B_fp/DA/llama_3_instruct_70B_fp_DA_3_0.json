            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\", which can be represented as \"If A, then B\". We also know that \"The book was not written by James\", which means \"Not A\". \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"The book is not a mystery novel\", which is \"Not B\". \n\nIn logic, if we have \"If A, then B\" and \"Not A\", we can infer \"Maybe B, maybe not B\", but we cannot infer \"Not B\" with certainty. This is because the conditional statement only guarantees that if A is true, then B must be true, but it does not provide any information about what happens when A is false. \n\nIn this case, even though the book was not written by James, it is still possible that it is a mystery novel written by someone else. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: no",
