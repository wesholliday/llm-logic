We also have \"The dog was not inside\" which can be represented as \"Not P\" or \"\u00acP\".\n\nFrom the statement \"P \u2192 Q\", we can infer that if P is false (\u00acP), we cannot conclude anything about Q. In other words, the truth value of Q is unknown when P is false.\n\nIn our case, we know \u00acP (the dog was not inside), but we cannot infer anything about Q (the cat was outside). Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"The cat was not outside\".\n\nAnswer: no",
