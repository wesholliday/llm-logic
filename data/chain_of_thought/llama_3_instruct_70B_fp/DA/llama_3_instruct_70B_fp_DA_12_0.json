            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\", which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo\". This implies that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, we are also given that \"Joe did not go to the park\", which means P is false.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n1. If P is false (Joe did not go to the park), and the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is true, it does not necessarily mean that Q (Lucy went to the zoo) is false. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo, unrelated to Joe's park visit.\n\n2. The conditional statement only guarantees that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. It does not provide any information about what happens if Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: no",
