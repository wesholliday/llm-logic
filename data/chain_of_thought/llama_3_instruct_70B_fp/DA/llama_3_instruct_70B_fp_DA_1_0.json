            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\", which can be represented as \"M \u2192 S\", where M represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S represents \"Sue was at the wedding\". We also know that \"Mary was not at the wedding\", which can be represented as \"\u00acM\".\n\nFrom the conditional statement \"M \u2192 S\", we can infer that if M is true, then S must also be true. However, we know that M is actually false (\u00acM). In this case, the conditional statement \"M \u2192 S\" does not provide any information about S, because the condition M is not satisfied.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"Sue was not at the wedding\" (\u00acS), we need to examine the possibilities. If M is false, then the conditional statement \"M \u2192 S\" is vacuously true, regardless of the value of S. This means that the statement \"M \u2192 S\" does not provide any conclusive evidence about S.\n\nHowever, we can use a process of elimination to arrive at a conclusion. If M is false, and the conditional statement \"M \u2192 S\" is true, then the only possibility is that S is also false. If S were true, then the conditional statement \"M \u2192 S\" would be false, because M is false but S is true. Therefore, we can infer that S is false, which means \"Sue was not at the wedding\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
