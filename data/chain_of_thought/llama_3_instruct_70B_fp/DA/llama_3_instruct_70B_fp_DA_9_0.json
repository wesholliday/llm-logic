            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\", which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" or \"P \u2192 Q\". We also know that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\", which means \"not P\" or \"\u00acP\".\n\nFrom the conditional statement, we can infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt (\u00acP), we cannot conclude that Mark bought the blue shirt (Q) or that Mark did not buy the blue shirt (\u00acQ). The conditional statement only guarantees that if Lisa buys the red shirt, then Mark buys the blue shirt, but it does not provide any information about what happens when Lisa does not buy the red shirt.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" does not imply \"If not P, then not Q\". We need more information to determine what Mark did when Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
