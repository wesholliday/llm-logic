We have a conditional statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\", which can be represented as \"If P, then M\". We also know that \"The doll was not plastic\", which can be represented as \"Not P\".\n\nFrom the conditional statement, we can infer that if the doll was plastic (P), then the truck would be metal (M). However, we know that the doll is not plastic (Not P). This means that the condition for the truck to be metal is not met.\n\nIn this case, we cannot conclude that the truck is not metal. The conditional statement only tells us what would happen if the doll was plastic, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when the doll is not plastic.\n\nAnswer: no",
