            "content": "Explanation: To determine if an argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, we have a conditional statement as the first premise: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" (If P, then Q). The second premise is \"Sue was at the wedding\" (Q). \n\nThe conclusion is \"Mary was at the wedding\" (P). However, the first premise only guarantees that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. It does not guarantee that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding. \n\nIn other words, the first premise does not provide enough information to conclude that Mary was at the wedding simply because Sue was at the wedding. There could be other reasons why Sue was at the wedding, and Mary might not have been there.\n\nAnswer: no",
