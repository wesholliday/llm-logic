This statement implies that one of the two conditions must be true: either the whiffle must be tinked, or it is shanked.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. If the whiffle might not be tinked (from statement 1), then the only other possibility is that it is shanked (from statement 2). This is because the \"or\" statement in the second sentence implies that if the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
