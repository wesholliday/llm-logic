This is an \"or\" statement, which means that if one option is false, the other must be true.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from both statements. If the flob might not be movated (from statement 1), then the first option in statement 2 (\"the flob must be movated\") is false. According to the \"or\" statement in statement 2, if the first option is false, then the second option (\"it is skizzled\") must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
