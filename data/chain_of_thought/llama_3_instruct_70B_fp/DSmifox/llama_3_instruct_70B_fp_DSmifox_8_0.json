'Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked' is a classic \"or\" statement, which means that at least one of the conditions must be true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If the sprocket is daggled, then the second statement is true, and we can't conclude anything about it being cranked.\n* If the sprocket is not daggled (as suggested by the first statement), then the second statement implies that it must be cranked, because the \"or\" condition requires at least one of the options to be true.\n\nSince we have a possibility where the sprocket is not daggled, and in that case, it must be cranked, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
