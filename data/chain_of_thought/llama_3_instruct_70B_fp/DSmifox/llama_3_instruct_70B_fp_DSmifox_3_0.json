'Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed' - This statement presents two possibilities: the splat is quanked or it is morphed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If the splat is quanked, then the second statement is true, but we can't conclude that the splat is morphed.\n* If the splat is not quanked (as suggested by the first statement), then the second statement implies that it must be morphed, because the \"or\" condition is satisfied.\n\nSince the first statement allows for the possibility that the splat is not quanked, and the second statement covers both possibilities, we can infer that if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
