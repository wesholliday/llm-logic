'Either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged' is a classic \"or\" statement, which means that at least one of the conditions must be true. If the wug must be garpled, then it's garpled. If it's not garpled, then it must be sproinged (by the rule of excluded middle).\n\n3. Now, let's combine the information from steps 1 and 2. If the wug might not be garpled (step 1), and we know that either it must be garpled or it is sproinged (step 2), then the possibility of the wug not being garpled implies that it must be sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
