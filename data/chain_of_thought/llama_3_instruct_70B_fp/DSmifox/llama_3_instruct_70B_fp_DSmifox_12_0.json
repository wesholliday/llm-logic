This is an \"or\" statement, which means that if one option is false, the other must be true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the smip might not be lupped (from statement 1), then the first option in statement 2 (\"the smip must be lupped\") is false. Since it's an \"or\" statement, if the first option is false, the second option must be true. Therefore, if the smip is not lupped, then it must be shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
