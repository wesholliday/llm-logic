            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked\" - This is an \"or\" statement, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. If the splat is morphed, then the statement is true. If the splat is not morphed, then it must be quanked for the statement to be true.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked\" - This statement negates the second part of the \"or\" statement in (1). It means that the splat does not have to be quanked.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from both statements. If the splat does not have to be quanked (from statement 2), and the only other option is that the splat is morphed (from statement 1), then we can conclude that the splat is indeed morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
