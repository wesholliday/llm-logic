It's a disjunction.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled\" - This statement negates the second option from the first statement. It's saying that the flugel must not be zargled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince the first statement is an \"or\" statement, and the second statement negates one of the options, we are left with only one possibility: the flugel is blimmed. If the flugel must not be zargled, then the only remaining option is that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
