            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" This can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck must have been blue.\"\n\nThe second premise is the negation of the consequent: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\" This can be represented as \"Not Q.\"\n\nThe conclusion is the negation of the antecedent: \"The car was not red.\" This can be represented as \"Not P.\"\n\nThis argument structure is a classic example of modus tollens, which is a valid argument form. In modus tollens, if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q,\" we can infer \"Not P.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
