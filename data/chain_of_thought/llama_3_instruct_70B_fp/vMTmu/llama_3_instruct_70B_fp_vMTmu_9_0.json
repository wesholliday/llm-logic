            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\". This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark must have bought the blue shirt\".\n\nThe second premise is the negation of the consequent: \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\". This can be represented as \"\u00acQ\".\n\nThe conclusion is the negation of the antecedent: \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\". This can be represented as \"\u00acP\".\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. If P \u2192 Q is true, and \u00acQ is true, then we can infer that \u00acP must be true. This is because if P were true, then Q would have to be true (by modus ponens), but we know that Q is not true. Therefore, P must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
