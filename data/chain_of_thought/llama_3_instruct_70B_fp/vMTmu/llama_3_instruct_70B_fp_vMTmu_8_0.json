            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" This can be represented as \"V \u2192 M\", where \"V\" represents \"the vampire was awake\" and \"M\" represents \"the mummy must have been awake\".\n\nThe second premise is the negation of the consequent: \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake\", which can be represented as \"\u00acM\".\n\nThe conclusion is the negation of the antecedent: \"The vampire was not awake\", which can be represented as \"\u00acV\".\n\nNow, let's see if we can derive the conclusion from the premises using logical rules. From the first premise, we know that if V is true, then M must be true. From the second premise, we know that M is not true. Therefore, we can conclude that V cannot be true, because if it were, M would be true, but we know M is not true. This is a valid application of modus tollens, a fundamental rule of logic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
