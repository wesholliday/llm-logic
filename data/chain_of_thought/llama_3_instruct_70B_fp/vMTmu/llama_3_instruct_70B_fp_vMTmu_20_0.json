            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This can be represented as \"If A, then B\" or \"A \u2192 B\".\n\nThe second premise is the negation of the consequent: \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\" This can be represented as \"Not B\" or \"\u00acB\".\n\nThe conclusion is the negation of the antecedent: \"The apple was not red.\" This can be represented as \"Not A\" or \"\u00acA\".\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. If A \u2192 B, and \u00acB, then we can infer \u00acA. This is a valid argument form, known as modus tollens.\n\nAnswer: yes",
