            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\". This can be represented as \"P \u2192 L\", where \"P\" represents \"Joe went to the park\" and \"L\" represents \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo\".\n\nThe second premise is the negation of the consequent: \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo\", which can be represented as \"\u00acL\".\n\nThe conclusion is the negation of the antecedent: \"Joe did not go to the park\", which can be represented as \"\u00acP\".\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. If P \u2192 L, and \u00acL, then we can infer \u00acP, because if Lucy didn't go to the zoo, then Joe couldn't have gone to the park (since if he did, Lucy would have gone to the zoo).\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus tollens, which is a valid argument form. Therefore, the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
