            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry\". This can be represented as \"C \u2192 B\", where \"C\" represents \"the cake was chocolate\" and \"B\" represents \"the muffins must have been blueberry\".\n\nThe second premise is the negation of the consequent: \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry\", which can be represented as \"\u00acB\".\n\nThe conclusion is the negation of the antecedent: \"The cake was not chocolate\", which can be represented as \"\u00acC\".\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. If C \u2192 B, and \u00acB, then we can infer \u00acC. This is a valid inference, known as modus tollens.\n\nAnswer: yes",
