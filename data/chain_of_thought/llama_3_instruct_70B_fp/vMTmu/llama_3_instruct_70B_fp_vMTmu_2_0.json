            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This can be represented as \"G \u2192 U\", where \"G\" represents \"the griffin was in the forest\" and \"U\" represents \"the unicorn must have been in the forest\".\n\nThe second premise is the negation of the consequent of the conditional statement: \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acU\", where \"\u00ac\" represents negation.\n\nThe conclusion is the negation of the antecedent of the conditional statement: \"The griffin was not in the forest.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acG\".\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. If G \u2192 U, and \u00acU, then we can infer \u00acG, because if the unicorn must not have been in the forest, and the griffin's presence implies the unicorn's presence, then the griffin must not have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
