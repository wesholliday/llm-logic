            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den\". This can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q is \"the wolf must have been in the den\".\n\nThe second premise is the negation of Q: \"It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den\", which can be represented as \"not Q\".\n\nThe conclusion is the negation of P: \"The bear was not in the cave\", which can be represented as \"not P\".\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. If P implies Q, and not Q is true, then we can infer that not P must be true. This is a valid inference, known as modus tollens.\n\nAnswer: yes",
