            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\". This can be represented as \"M \u2192 S\", where \"M\" represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \"S\" represents \"Sue must have been at the wedding\".\n\nThe second premise is the negation of the consequent of the conditional statement: \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding\". This can be represented as \"\u00acS\".\n\nThe conclusion is the negation of the antecedent of the conditional statement: \"Mary was not at the wedding\". This can be represented as \"\u00acM\".\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. If M \u2192 S, and \u00acS, then we can infer \u00acM. This is a valid inference, known as modus tollens.\n\nAnswer: yes",
