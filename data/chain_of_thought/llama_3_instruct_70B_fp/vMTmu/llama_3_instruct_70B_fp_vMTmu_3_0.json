            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as \"If A, then B\" or \"A \u2192 B\".\n\nThe second premise is the negation of the conclusion of the conditional statement: \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as \"not B\" or \"\u00acB\".\n\nThe conclusion is the negation of the antecedent of the conditional statement: \"The book was not written by James.\" This can be represented as \"not A\" or \"\u00acA\".\n\nThe argument structure is:\n\nA \u2192 B\n\u00acB\n\u2234 \u00acA\n\nThis is a classic example of a valid argument form called modus tollens. It is a rule of inference that states: if A implies B, and B is false, then A must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
