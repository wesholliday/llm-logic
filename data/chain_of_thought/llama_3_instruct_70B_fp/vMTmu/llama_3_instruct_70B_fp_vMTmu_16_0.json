            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\". This can be represented as \"C \u2192 D\", where \"C\" represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and \"D\" represents \"the pants must have been denim\".\n\nThe second premise is the negation of the consequent: \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim\". This can be represented as \"\u00acD\", where \"\u00ac\" represents negation.\n\nThe conclusion is the negation of the antecedent: \"The shirt was not cotton\". This can be represented as \"\u00acC\".\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. If C \u2192 D is true, and \u00acD is true, then we can infer that \u00acC must be true. This is because if the pants must not have been denim (\u00acD), and the shirt being cotton implies the pants must have been denim (C \u2192 D), then the shirt cannot have been cotton (\u00acC).\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus tollens, which is a valid argument form. Therefore, the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
