            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\". This can be represented as \"P \u2192 M\", where \"P\" stands for \"the doll was plastic\" and \"M\" stands for \"the truck must have been metal\".\n\nThe second premise is the negation of the consequent: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\". This can be represented as \"\u00acM\".\n\nThe conclusion is the negation of the antecedent: \"The doll was not plastic\". This can be represented as \"\u00acP\".\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. If \"P \u2192 M\" is true, and \"\u00acM\" is true, then we can infer that \"\u00acP\" must be true. This is because if the doll being plastic implies the truck being metal, and the truck is not metal, then the doll cannot be plastic.\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus tollens, which is a valid argument form.\n\nAnswer: yes",
