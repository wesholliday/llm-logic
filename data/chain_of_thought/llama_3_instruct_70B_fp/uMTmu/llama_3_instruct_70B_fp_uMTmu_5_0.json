The first statement says \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\" or \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"Jeff played basketball\" and B is \"Amy must have played tennis\". \n\nThe second statement says \"it's not the case that Amy must have played tennis\", which can be represented as \"not B\" or \"\u00acB\". \n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. If A \u2192 B, and \u00acB, then we can infer \u00acA. This is a valid logical inference, known as modus tollens. In this case, \u00acA means \"Jeff did not play basketball\". \n\nAnswer: yes",
