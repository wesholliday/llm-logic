If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\nThis implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy going to the zoo is a necessary consequence.\n\n2. It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\nThis statement negates the consequence mentioned in statement 1. Since Lucy must not have gone to the zoo, we can infer that the condition that led to this consequence (Joe going to the park) must not have occurred.\n\nIn other words, if Joe had gone to the park, then Lucy would have gone to the zoo, but since Lucy didn't go to the zoo, Joe must not have gone to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
