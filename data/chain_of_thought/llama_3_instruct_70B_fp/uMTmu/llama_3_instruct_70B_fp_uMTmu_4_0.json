If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\nThis is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"A \u2192 R\", where A is \"the alien visited Mars\" and R is \"the robot visited Jupiter\".\n\n2. It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter.\nThis statement can be represented as \"\u00acR\", which means \"the robot did not visit Jupiter\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf A \u2192 R, and \u00acR, then we can conclude that \u00acA. This is because if A were true, then R would also be true (by the conditional statement), but we know that R is not true. Therefore, A must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
