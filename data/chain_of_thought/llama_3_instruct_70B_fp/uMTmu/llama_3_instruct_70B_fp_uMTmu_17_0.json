The first statement says \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Ben ate pasta \u2192 Kate ate salad\". The second statement says \"it's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad\", which can be represented as \"\u00ac(Kate ate salad)\".\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that Kate did not eat salad. Now, let's look at the first statement. If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad, but we know that Kate did not eat salad. This means that the condition \"Ben ate pasta\" cannot be true, because if it were true, then Kate would have eaten salad, which is not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
