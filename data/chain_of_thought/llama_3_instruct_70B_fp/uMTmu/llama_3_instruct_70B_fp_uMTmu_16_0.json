            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. The first statement says \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the shirt was cotton\" and B is \"the pants must have been denim\". \n\nThe second statement says \"it's not the case that the pants must have been denim\", which is equivalent to saying \"not B\". \n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. If A implies B, and not B is true, then we can conclude that not A must be true. This is a classic rule of inference in logic, often referred to as modus tollens. \n\nIn this case, if the shirt being cotton implies the pants being denim, and the pants are not denim, then we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
