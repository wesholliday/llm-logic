If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\nThis is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana must have been yellow\".\n\n2. It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\nThis statement is the negation of B, which means B is false.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf A (the apple was red) implies B (the banana must have been yellow), and B is false, then we can conclude that A must also be false. This is because if A were true, it would imply B, but B is false, so A cannot be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
