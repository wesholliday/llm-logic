If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\nThis implies that if Alex finished, Chris also finished. It does not provide any information about what happens if Alex did not finish.\n\n2. It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\nThis statement tells us that Chris did not necessarily finish the race. It does not provide any direct information about Alex.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race (by statement 1). But we know that Chris did not necessarily finish the race (by statement 2). This means that Alex cannot have finished the race, because if Alex had finished, Chris would have finished too (by statement 1), which contradicts statement 2.\n\nAnswer: yes",
