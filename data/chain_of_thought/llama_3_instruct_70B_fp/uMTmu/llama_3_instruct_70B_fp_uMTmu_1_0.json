If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\nThis implies that Mary's presence at the wedding is a sufficient condition for Sue's presence.\n\n2. It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\nThis means that we cannot conclude that Sue was definitely at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Mary was at the wedding, then according to statement 1, Sue must have been at the wedding. But statement 2 contradicts this, saying that we cannot conclude that Sue was definitely at the wedding. This contradiction implies that our initial assumption - Mary was at the wedding - must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
