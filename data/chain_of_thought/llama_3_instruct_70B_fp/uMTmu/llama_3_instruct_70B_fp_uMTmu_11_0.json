If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\nThis is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: Cake is chocolate \u2192 Muffins are blueberry\n\n2. It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\nThis statement can be represented as: \u00ac(Muffins are blueberry)\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the cake was indeed chocolate, then according to statement 1, the muffins must have been blueberry. But statement 2 tells us that it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry. This means that our initial assumption - the cake was chocolate - leads to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that our initial assumption must be false, which means the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
