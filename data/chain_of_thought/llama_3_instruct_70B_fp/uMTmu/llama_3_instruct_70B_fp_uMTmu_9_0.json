It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. (Negation of the conclusion)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then a certain condition is met (Mark buying the blue shirt). However, statement 2 tells us that this condition is not met. This means that the premise \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" cannot be true, because if it were, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt, which is not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
