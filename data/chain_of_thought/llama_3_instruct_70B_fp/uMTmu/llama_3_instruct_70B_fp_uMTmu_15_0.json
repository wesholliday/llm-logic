The first statement says \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\" This implies that if Sam took a plane, then Erin taking a train is a necessary consequence. The second statement says \"it's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\" This means that Erin taking a train is not a necessary consequence.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. If Sam took a plane, then according to the first statement, Erin must have taken a train. But the second statement contradicts this, saying that Erin taking a train is not a necessary consequence. This means that the assumption \"Sam took a plane\" leads to a contradiction. Therefore, we can conclude that the assumption \"Sam took a plane\" must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
