If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\nThis implies that the presence of the griffin in the forest is a sufficient condition for the unicorn to be in the forest.\n\n2. It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\nThis statement tells us that the unicorn was not necessarily in the forest.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the griffin was in the forest, then according to statement 1, the unicorn must have been in the forest. But statement 2 contradicts this, saying that the unicorn was not necessarily in the forest. This contradiction can only be resolved if the initial assumption - the griffin was in the forest - is false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
