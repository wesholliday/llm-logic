The first statement says \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\" This implies that if Tom watched football, then it necessarily follows that Jen watched basketball. The second statement says \"it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\" This means that we cannot conclude that Jen watched basketball.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. If Tom watched football, then according to the first statement, Jen must have watched basketball. But the second statement tells us that we cannot conclude that Jen watched basketball. This means that Tom cannot have watched football, because if he did, we would be able to conclude that Jen watched basketball, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
