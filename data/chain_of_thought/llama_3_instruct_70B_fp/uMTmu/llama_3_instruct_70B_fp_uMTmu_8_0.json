If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\nThis implies that the vampire's being awake is a sufficient condition for the mummy to be awake. In other words, if the vampire is awake, it guarantees that the mummy is also awake.\n\n2. It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\nThis statement tells us that the mummy was not awake.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. Since the mummy was not awake, and the vampire's being awake would have guaranteed the mummy's wakefulness, we can conclude that the vampire must not have been awake. If the vampire were awake, the mummy would have been awake too, but we know that's not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
