If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\nThis is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck must have been blue\".\n\n2. It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\nThis statement is the negation of Q, which means Q is false.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf P (the car was red) implies Q (the truck must have been blue), and Q is false, then we can conclude that P must also be false. This is because if P were true, it would imply Q, but Q is false, so P cannot be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
