If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\nThis implies that if James wrote the book, it's a mystery novel. It doesn't say anything about other authors or other genres.\n\n2. It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\nThis statement tells us that the book might not be a mystery novel. It could be another genre.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf James wrote the book, it would be a mystery novel (from statement 1). But we know the book might not be a mystery novel (from statement 2). This means that James might not have written the book, because if he did, it would be a mystery novel, which is not necessarily the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
