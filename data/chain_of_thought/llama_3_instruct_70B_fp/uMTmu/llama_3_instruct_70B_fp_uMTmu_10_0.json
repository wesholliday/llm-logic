The first statement says \"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the dog was inside\" and Q is \"the cat must have been outside\". \n\nThe second statement says \"it's not the case that the cat must have been outside\", which is equivalent to saying \"not Q\". \n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. If P implies Q, and not Q is true, then we can conclude that P must be false. This is because if P were true, then Q would also be true (by the first statement), but we know that Q is not true. Therefore, P must be false.\n\nIn this case, P is \"the dog was inside\", so we can conclude that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
