In that case, according to statement 2, the only other option is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nHowever, we can't be 100% certain that the milk is not in the fridge based on statement 1 alone, as it only suggests a possibility. Therefore, we can't definitively conclude that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: no",
