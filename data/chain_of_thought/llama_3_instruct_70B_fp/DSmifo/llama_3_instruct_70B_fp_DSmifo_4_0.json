If the cat is playing in the bedroom, then it's not napping on the couch, and vice versa.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\na) The cat is playing in the bedroom: In this case, the first statement is false, and the second statement is true (because the cat is playing in the bedroom).\n\nb) The cat is not playing in the bedroom: In this case, the first statement is true, and the second statement implies that the cat must be napping on the couch (because it's not playing in the bedroom).\n\nSince we can't be certain that the cat is playing in the bedroom (due to the first statement), we can infer that the cat might not be playing in the bedroom. In this scenario, the second statement ensures that the cat must be napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
