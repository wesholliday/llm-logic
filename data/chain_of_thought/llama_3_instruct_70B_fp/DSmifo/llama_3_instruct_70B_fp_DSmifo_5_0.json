In that case, the only other option is that they are in the jar, according to statement 2.\n\nHowever, we can't conclude with absolute certainty that the cookies are in the jar. There's still a possibility that the cookies are indeed in the pantry, despite the fact that they might not be.\n\nAnswer: no",
