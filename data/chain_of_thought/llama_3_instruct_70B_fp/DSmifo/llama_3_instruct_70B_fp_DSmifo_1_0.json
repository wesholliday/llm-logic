'Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside' is a disjunction, which means one of the two options must be true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If Fido is in the garden, then the second statement is true, but we can't conclude that Fido is inside.\n* If Fido is not in the garden, then the first statement is true, and since the second statement is a disjunction, it means Fido must be inside (because Fido can't be in the garden).\n\nSo, if Fido might not be in the garden, and we have a disjunction that covers both possibilities, we can infer that if Fido is not in the garden, then Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
