It says that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. However, we know from statement 1 that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This means that the condition \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" cannot be true, because if it were true, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt, which is not the case.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that the condition \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" must be false, because if it were true, it would lead to a contradiction with statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
