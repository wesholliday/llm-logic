However, we know from statement 1 that the unicorn is not in the forest. Therefore, the only way this conditional statement can be true is if the griffin is not in the forest.\n\nIf the griffin were in the forest, it would contradict statement 1, since the conditional statement would imply the unicorn is in the forest, which we know is not true. Hence, the griffin must not be in the forest to maintain the consistency of the statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
