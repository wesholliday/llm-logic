It implies that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. However, it does not provide any information about the cake being chocolate or not.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the cake was indeed chocolate, then according to statement 2, the muffins would be blueberry. But statement 1 tells us that the muffins are not blueberry. This means that the assumption \"the cake was chocolate\" leads to a contradiction. Therefore, we can conclude that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
