It implies that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. However, we know from statement 1 that the truck is not blue. Therefore, the condition \"the car was red\" cannot be true, because if it were, the truck would be blue, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude that the car cannot be red, because if it were, the truck would be blue, which is not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
