'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' - This is a conditional statement. It means that if Tom watched football, then it must be the case that Jen watched basketball. However, since we know that Jen did not watch basketball (from statement 1), it implies that the condition 'Tom watched football' cannot be true. If it were true, then Jen would have watched basketball, but we know that's not the case.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude that the condition 'Tom watched football' must be false, which means Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
