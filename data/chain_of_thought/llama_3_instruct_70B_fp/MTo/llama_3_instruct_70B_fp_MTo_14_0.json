It says that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf must be in the den. But we know from statement 1 that the wolf is not in the den. Therefore, the condition \"the bear was in the cave\" cannot be true, because if it were true, the wolf would be in the den, which is not the case.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that the bear cannot be in the cave, because if it were, the wolf would be in the den, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
