In other words, if James is the author, the book must be a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the book was written by James, then according to statement 2, it would be a mystery novel. However, statement 1 tells us that the book is not a mystery novel. This means that the condition \"the book was written by James\" cannot be true, because if it were, the book would be a mystery novel, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
