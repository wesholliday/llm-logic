It implies that if the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside. But we know from statement 1 that the cat is not outside. Therefore, the condition \"the dog was inside\" cannot be true, because if it were, the cat would be outside, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that the dog cannot be inside, because if it were, the cat would be outside, which is not the case.\n\nAnswer: no",
