It means that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. But we know from statement 1 that Amy did not play tennis. Therefore, the condition \"Jeff played basketball\" cannot be true, because if it were true, then Amy would have played tennis, which is not the case.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that Jeff did not play basketball, because if he had, then Amy would have played tennis, which is not possible given statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
