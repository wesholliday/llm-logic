            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\" - This statement tells us that Lucy did not visit the zoo.\n2. \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be rewritten as \"If Joe went to the park \u2192 Lucy went to the zoo\". This means that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince Lucy did not go to the zoo (from statement 1), and the conditional statement says that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would have gone to the zoo, we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park. If Joe had gone to the park, Lucy would have gone to the zoo, but we know that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: yes",
