If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nFrom statement 2, we can infer that if the alien visited Mars, it would imply that the robot visited Jupiter. However, statement 1 contradicts this, stating that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nThis means that the condition \"the alien visited Mars\" cannot be true, because if it were, it would lead to a contradiction (the robot visiting Jupiter, which is not the case).\n\nAnswer: yes",
