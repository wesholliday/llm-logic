It says that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. But we know from statement 1 that the truck is not metal. So, if the doll were plastic, it would contradict statement 1.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that the doll cannot be plastic, because if it were, it would imply that the truck is metal, which we know is not true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
