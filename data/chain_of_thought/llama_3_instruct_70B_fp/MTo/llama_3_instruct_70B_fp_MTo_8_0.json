However, we know from statement 1 that the mummy is not awake.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* If the vampire was awake, the mummy would be awake (according to statement 2).\n* But the mummy is not awake (according to statement 1).\n* Therefore, the vampire cannot be awake, because if it were, the mummy would be awake, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
