It means that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race as well.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Alex had finished the race, then according to the conditional statement, Chris would have finished the race as well. But we know that Chris did not finish the race (from statement 1). Therefore, the assumption that Alex finished the race leads to a contradiction. This means that our initial assumption - \"Alex finished the race\" - must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
