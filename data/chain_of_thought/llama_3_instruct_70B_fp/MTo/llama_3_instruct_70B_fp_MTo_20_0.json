It says that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. But we know from statement 1 that the banana is not yellow. So, if the apple were red, it would imply that the banana is yellow, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the apple cannot be red, because if it were, it would lead to a contradiction. Therefore, we can conclude that the apple is not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
