If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n\nFrom statement 2, we can see that if Sam took a plane, it would imply that Erin took a train. However, statement 1 tells us that Erin did not take a train. This means that the condition \"Sam took a plane\" cannot be true, because if it were, it would contradict statement 1.\n\nIn other words, if Sam took a plane, it would lead to a logical contradiction (Erin taking a train, which we know is not the case). Therefore, we can conclude that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
