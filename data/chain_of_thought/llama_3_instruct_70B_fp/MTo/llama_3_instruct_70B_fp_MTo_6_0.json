'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta' - This is a conditional statement. It implies that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. However, we know from statement 1 that Bob did not choose pasta. Therefore, the condition 'Sue chose pizza' cannot be true, because if it were, Bob would have chosen pasta, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude that Sue did not choose pizza, because if she had, Bob would have chosen pasta, which is not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
