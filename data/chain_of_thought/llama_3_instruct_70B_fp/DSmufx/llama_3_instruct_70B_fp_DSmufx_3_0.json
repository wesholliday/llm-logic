            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed\" - This is a disjunction, meaning one or both of the statements must be true. It can be represented as \"Quank \u2228 Morph\".\n2. \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked\" - This is a negation, meaning the opposite of the statement is true. It can be represented as \"\u00acQuank\".\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that \"Quank\" is false. Now, let's look at statement 1 again. Since \"Quank\" is false, the only way the disjunction \"Quank \u2228 Morph\" can be true is if \"Morph\" is true. This is because a disjunction is true if at least one of its components is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
