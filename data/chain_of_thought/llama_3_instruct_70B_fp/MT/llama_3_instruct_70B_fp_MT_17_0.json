            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\" which can be represented as \"Ben ate pasta \u2192 Kate ate the salad\". This implies that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad. \n\nWe are also given that \"Kate did not eat the salad\". This means that the consequent of the conditional statement is false. \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"Ben did not eat pasta\". To do this, we can use modus tollens, a rule of inference that states: if we have a conditional statement \"A \u2192 B\" and we know that \"not B\" is true, then we can conclude that \"not A\" is true. \n\nIn our case, we have \"Ben ate pasta \u2192 Kate ate the salad\" and we know that \"Kate did not eat the salad\" (which is equivalent to \"not Kate ate the salad\"). Therefore, using modus tollens, we can conclude that \"Ben did not eat pasta\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
