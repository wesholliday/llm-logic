            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\" or \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow\".\n2. \"The banana was not yellow\" - This statement negates the conclusion of the conditional statement, i.e., it says that B is false.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf A \u2192 B, and B is false, then we can infer that A must also be false. This is because if A were true, then B would have to be true according to the conditional statement. But since B is false, A cannot be true.\n\nIn this case, A is \"the apple was red\", and B is \"the banana was yellow\". Since B is false (the banana was not yellow), we can conclude that A must also be false, i.e., the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
