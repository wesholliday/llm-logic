            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\", which can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the book was written by James\" and B is \"the book is a mystery novel\". This implies that if the book was written by James, it must be a mystery novel. \n\nWe are also given that \"The book is not a mystery novel\", which means B is false. Now, we need to determine if we can infer that the book was not written by James (A is false).\n\nIf A were true, then B would have to be true according to the conditional statement. But we know B is false. Therefore, A cannot be true, because if it were, B would be true, which contradicts the fact that B is false. \n\nAnswer: yes",
