            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" \n\nThe second statement is \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt,\" which is equivalent to \"not Q.\" \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" (not P) from these two statements. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the consequence (Q) is false, we can conclude that the antecedent (P) must also be false. This is because if P were true, Q would have to be true as well, but we know Q is false. Therefore, P must be false to avoid a contradiction. \n\nIn this case, if Mark did not buy the blue shirt (not Q), then Lisa must not have bought the red shirt (not P), because if Lisa had bought the red shirt, Mark would have bought the blue shirt, which is not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
