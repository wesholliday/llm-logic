            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\". This can be represented as \"Sue chose pizza \u2192 Bob chose pasta\". The second statement is a negation: \"Bob did not choose pasta\", which can be represented as \"\u00ac(Bob chose pasta)\".\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that Bob did not choose pasta. Now, let's examine the conditional statement. If Bob did not choose pasta, then the consequent of the conditional statement is false. Using modus tollens, we can infer that the antecedent \"Sue chose pizza\" must also be false, because if it were true, then the consequent \"Bob chose pasta\" would also be true, which contradicts the fact that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
