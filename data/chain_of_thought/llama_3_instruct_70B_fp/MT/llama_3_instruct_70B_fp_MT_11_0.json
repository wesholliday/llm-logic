            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry\". This implies that if P is true, then Q must also be true. \n\nWe are also given that \"The muffins were not blueberry\", which means Q is false. Now, we need to determine if we can infer that \"The cake was not chocolate\" (i.e., P is false).\n\nIf P were true, then Q would also be true according to the conditional statement. But we know Q is false. Therefore, P cannot be true, because if it were, Q would be true, which contradicts the fact that Q is false. Hence, we can conclude that P is false, i.e., \"The cake was not chocolate\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
