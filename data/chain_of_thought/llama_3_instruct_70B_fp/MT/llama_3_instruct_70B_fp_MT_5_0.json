            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\", which can be represented as \"J \u2192 A\" (where J represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and A represents \"Amy played tennis\"). We also know that \"Amy did not play tennis\", which can be represented as \"\u00acA\" (where \u00ac denotes negation).\n\nFrom the conditional statement \"J \u2192 A\", we can infer that if J is true, then A must also be true. However, we know that A is actually false (\u00acA). This means that the condition \"J\" cannot be true, because if it were, then A would have to be true, but we know it's not.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
