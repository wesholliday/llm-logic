            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" which can be represented as \"If P, then M\" where P represents \"the doll was plastic\" and M represents \"the truck was metal\". This statement implies that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. \n\nNow, we are given that \"The truck was not metal\" which can be represented as \"not M\". We need to find out if we can infer \"The doll was not plastic\" which can be represented as \"not P\".\n\nFrom the conditional statement, we know that if P is true, then M must be true. But we are given that M is not true (the truck is not metal). Therefore, we can conclude that P (the doll is plastic) cannot be true, because if it were true, then M would also be true, which is not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
