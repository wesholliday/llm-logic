            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Mary \u2192 Sue\". It means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding too.\n\n2. \"Sue was not at the wedding\" - This is a negation of Sue's presence at the wedding, which can be represented as \"\u00acSue\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Mary was at the wedding, then according to the first statement, Sue would have been at the wedding too. But we know that Sue was not at the wedding (from the second statement). This means that the condition \"Mary \u2192 Sue\" is not satisfied, because Mary being at the wedding would imply Sue being at the wedding, which is not the case.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Mary must not have been at the wedding, because if she were, then Sue would have been at the wedding too, which contradicts the fact that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
