            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\", which can be represented as \"If A, then B\". We also know that \"The pants were not denim\", which can be represented as \"Not B\". \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"The shirt was not cotton\" (Not A) from these two statements. \n\nIn a conditional statement \"If A, then B\", if B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is because if A were true, then B would have to be true according to the conditional statement. But since B is false, A cannot be true. \n\nIn our case, B is \"The pants were denim\", which is false. Therefore, we can conclude that A, \"The shirt was cotton\", must also be false. \n\nAnswer: yes",
