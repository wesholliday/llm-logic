            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\", which can be represented as \"A \u2192 C\", where A represents \"Alex finished the race\" and C represents \"Chris finished the race\". This statement implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race as well. \n\nWe are also given the statement \"Chris did not finish the race\", which can be represented as \"\u00acC\", where \u00ac denotes negation. \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"Alex did not finish the race\" (\u00acA) from the given statements. \n\nTo do this, we can use modus tollens, a rule of inference that states: if A \u2192 C and \u00acC, then \u00acA. \n\nIn our case, we have A \u2192 C (If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race) and \u00acC (Chris did not finish the race). Therefore, we can apply modus tollens to conclude \u00acA, which represents \"Alex did not finish the race\". \n\nAnswer: yes",
