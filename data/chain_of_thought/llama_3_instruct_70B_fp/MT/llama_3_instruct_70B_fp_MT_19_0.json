            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\", which can be represented as \"Tom watches football \u2192 Jen watches basketball\". This implies that if Tom watches football, then Jen must watch basketball. \n\nNow, we are also given that \"Jen did not watch basketball\". This means that the consequent of the conditional statement (Jen watches basketball) is false. \n\nUsing modus tollens, a rule of inference, we can conclude that if the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false. In this case, if Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
