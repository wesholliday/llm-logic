            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\", which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" or \"P \u2192 Q\". We also know that \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\", which can be represented as \"not Q\" or \"\u00acQ\". \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"Joe did not go to the park\" or \"not P\" from these statements. \n\nIn a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\", if Q is false (\u00acQ), we can conclude that P must also be false (\u00acP) to avoid a contradiction. This is because if P were true, then Q would have to be true according to the conditional statement, but we know Q is false. \n\nSo, in this case, since Lucy did not go to the zoo (\u00acQ), we can infer that Joe did not go to the park (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: yes",
