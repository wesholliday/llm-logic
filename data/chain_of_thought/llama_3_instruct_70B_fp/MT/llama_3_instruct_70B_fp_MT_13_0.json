            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue\". This statement implies that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue.\n\n2. \"The truck was not blue\" - This statement negates Q, implying that the truck is not blue.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the car was red (P), then the truck would be blue (Q) according to the first statement. However, we know that the truck is not blue (~Q). This means that the condition \"If P, then Q\" is not satisfied, as Q is false.\n\nSince the implication \"If P, then Q\" is not true when Q is false, we can infer that P (the car was red) must also be false. This is because if P were true, Q would also be true, but we know that Q is false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
