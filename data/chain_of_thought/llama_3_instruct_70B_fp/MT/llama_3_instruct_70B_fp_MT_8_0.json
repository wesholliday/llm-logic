            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\", which can be represented as \"V \u2192 M\", where V represents \"the vampire was awake\" and M represents \"the mummy was awake\". This statement implies that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake. However, it does not provide any information about the vampire's state when the mummy is not awake.\n\nThe second statement \"The mummy was not awake\" can be represented as \"\u00acM\", where \u00ac denotes negation. This statement tells us that the mummy was not awake.\n\nNow, let's see if we can infer \"The vampire was not awake\" from these two statements. Since the mummy was not awake (\u00acM), and we know that if the vampire was awake, the mummy would also be awake (V \u2192 M), we can conclude that the vampire must not have been awake. If the vampire were awake, the mummy would also be awake, but we know that's not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
