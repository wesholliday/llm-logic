This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive, meaning that if one is true, the other must be false. \n\nWe are also told that the phone isn't ringing in the kitchen. This means that the second option (the phone ringing in the kitchen) is false. \n\nSince the two options are mutually exclusive, and the second option is false, we can conclude that the first option (the phone is in the living room) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
