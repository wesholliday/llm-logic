This implies that these are the only two possible locations of the sunglasses. \n\nThen, we are told that the sunglasses aren't perched on her head. This means that the second option (sunglasses being perched on her head) is eliminated. \n\nSince we know that the sunglasses must be in one of the two locations, and they are not in the second location (perched on her head), it logically follows that they must be in the first location, which is her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
