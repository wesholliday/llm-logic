This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that one of them must be true and the other must be false. \n\nWe are then told that the milk isn't chilling in the fridge. This means that the second option (the milk is chilling in the fridge) is false. \n\nSince the two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, if the second option is false, then the first option (the milk is on the counter) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
