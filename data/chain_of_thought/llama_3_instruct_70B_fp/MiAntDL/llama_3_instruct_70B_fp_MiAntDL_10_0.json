            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The document might be signed or notarized\" implies that there are two possible actions that could be taken with the document: signing and notarizing. The use of \"or\" suggests that these actions are not mutually exclusive, meaning the document could be signed, notarized, or both. \n\nSince signing is one of the possible actions mentioned, it is reasonable to conclude that the document might indeed be signed. The fact that it might also be notarized does not affect the possibility of it being signed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
