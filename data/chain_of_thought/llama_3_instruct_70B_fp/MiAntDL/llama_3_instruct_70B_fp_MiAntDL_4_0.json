The phrase \"might be\" indicates uncertainty, suggesting that we are not sure which of these two outcomes will occur. \n\nFrom this statement, we can logically conclude that one of the possible outcomes is that the meeting is at 2 PM. This is because the original statement explicitly mentions this as a possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
