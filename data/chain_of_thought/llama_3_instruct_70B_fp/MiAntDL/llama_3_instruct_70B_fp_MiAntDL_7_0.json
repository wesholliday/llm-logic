This statement does not provide a definitive answer, but rather presents two possibilities. \n\nFrom this statement, we can infer that the exam might be difficult because it is one of the two possibilities mentioned. The statement does not rule out the possibility that the exam is difficult, and in fact, explicitly mentions it as a possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
