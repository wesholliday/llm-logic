It does not provide any information about which one is true, only that one of them must be true.\n\n2. \"The fleeg is not surned\" - This statement negates one of the possibilities presented in the first statement, namely, that the fleeg is surned.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince the fleeg is not surned (from statement 2), and we know that either it is surned or it is bluttered (from statement 1), we can conclude that the only remaining possibility is that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
