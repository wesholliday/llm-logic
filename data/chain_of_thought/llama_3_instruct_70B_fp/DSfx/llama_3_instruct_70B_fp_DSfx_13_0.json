The first statement is \"Either the glip is tragged or it is slogged\", which can be represented as \"A or B\", where A is \"the glip is tragged\" and B is \"the glip is slogged\". This statement implies that at least one of the two conditions must be true.\n\nThe second statement is \"The glip is not tragged\", which can be represented as \"not A\". This statement tells us that A is definitely false.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. We know that \"A or B\" is true, and we also know that A is false. This means that B must be true, because if A were true, then \"A or B\" would still be true, but we know A is false. Therefore, the only way \"A or B\" can be true is if B is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
