The splat is not quanked.\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that there are only two possibilities: the splat is quanked or it is morphed. The second premise tells us that the splat is not quanked. \n\nNow, if the splat is not quanked, and there are only two possibilities (quanked or morphed), then the only remaining possibility is that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
