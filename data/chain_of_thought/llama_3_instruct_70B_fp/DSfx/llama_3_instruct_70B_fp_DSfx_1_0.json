It's possible that both are true, but we can't conclude that from this statement alone.\n\n2. \"The flugel is not zargled\" - This statement tells us that the flugel is definitely not zargled.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from these two statements. Since the flugel is not zargled (from statement 2), and we know that either it's zargled or blimmed (from statement 1), the only remaining possibility is that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
