It could be that the twonk is varnished, or it could be that the twonk is plinked, or it could be both.\n\n2. \"The twonk is not plinked\" - This statement tells us that the twonk is definitely not plinked.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from these two statements. Since the twonk is not plinked (from statement 2), and it must be either varnished or plinked (from statement 1), the only remaining possibility is that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
