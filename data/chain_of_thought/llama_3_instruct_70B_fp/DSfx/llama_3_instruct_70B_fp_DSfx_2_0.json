It's an inclusive or, meaning that both conditions can be true, or only one of them can be true.\n\n2. \"The wug is not bimmed\" - This statement tells us that the wug is definitely not bimmed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince the wug is not bimmed, and we know that either it's bimmed or it's flooped, the only remaining possibility is that the wug is flooped. If it were not flooped, then the first statement would be false, because it would mean that neither condition is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
