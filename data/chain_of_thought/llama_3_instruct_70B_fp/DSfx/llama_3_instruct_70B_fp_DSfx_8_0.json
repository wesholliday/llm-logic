(This is an \"or\" statement, which means that at least one of the options must be true.)\n2. The sprocket is not daggled. (This statement tells us that the first option in the \"or\" statement is false.)\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. If the sprocket is not daggled, and it must be either daggled or cranked, then the only remaining option is that the sprocket is cranked. This is because the \"or\" statement ensures that one of the options must be true, and we've eliminated the first option.\n\nAnswer: yes",
