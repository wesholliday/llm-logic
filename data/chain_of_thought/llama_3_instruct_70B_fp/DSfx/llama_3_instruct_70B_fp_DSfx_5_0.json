The zinger is not smoogled.\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that there are only two possibilities: the zinger is either smoogled or fraggled. The second premise tells us that the zinger is not smoogled. \n\nNow, if the zinger is not smoogled, and it can only be either smoogled or fraggled, then it must be fraggled. This is because we have eliminated the possibility of it being smoogled, and we are left with only one other option.\n\nAnswer: yes",
