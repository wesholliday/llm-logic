It's possible that both are true, but we can't conclude that from this statement alone.\n\n2. \"The smip is not lupped\" - This statement tells us that the first option in the \"or\" statement is false. Since the \"or\" statement must be true, and the first option is false, the second option must be true to satisfy the \"or\" condition.\n\nAnswer: yes",
