It's an inclusive or, meaning that both conditions can be true, or only one of them can be true.\n\n2. \"The sneg is not sproted\" - This statement tells us that the sneg is definitely not sproted.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince the sneg is not sproted (from statement 2), we can focus on the first statement. The first statement says that either the sneg is sproted or it is crampled. We know the sneg is not sproted, so the only remaining option is that the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
