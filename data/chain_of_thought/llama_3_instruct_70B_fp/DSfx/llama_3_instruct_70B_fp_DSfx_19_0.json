It's possible that both conditions are true, but we can't conclude that from this statement alone.\n\n2. \"The smonk is not plagged\" - This statement tells us that the first condition in the \"or\" statement is false.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince the smonk is not plagged, and we know that either it's plagged or it's vreebled, the only remaining possibility is that the smonk is vreebled. If it weren't vreebled, the \"or\" statement would be false, which would be a contradiction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
