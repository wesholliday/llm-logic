It's possible that both are true, but we can't conclude that from this statement alone.\n\n2. \"The fribble is not crinked\" - This statement tells us that the first option in the \"or\" statement is false.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible scenarios:\n\n* If the fribble is not crinked, then the \"or\" statement from (1) would be false if the fribble is not snurgled. But we know that the \"or\" statement is true, so the fribble must be snurgled to make the \"or\" statement true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
