It's an exclusive or, meaning that both states cannot be true at the same time.\n\n2. \"The whiffle is not tinked\" - This statement tells us that the whiffle is not in the tinked state.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. Since the whiffle is not tinked, and it can only be either tinked or shanked, we can conclude that the whiffle must be in the shanked state.\n\nAnswer: yes",
