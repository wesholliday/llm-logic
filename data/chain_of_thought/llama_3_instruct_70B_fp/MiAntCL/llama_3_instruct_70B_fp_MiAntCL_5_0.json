            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can make this inference, let's break down the original statement and the potential inference.\n\nThe original statement is \"The package might be delivered today\", which implies that there is a possibility that the package will be delivered today.\n\nThe potential inference is \"The package might be delivered today and signed for\". This statement adds an additional condition to the original statement, which is that the package will not only be delivered today but also signed for.\n\nIn general, when we add more conditions to a possibility, it becomes less likely to occur. However, in this case, signing for a package is a common practice when receiving a delivery, so it's not an unlikely scenario.\n\nThe key question is whether the original statement implies that the package will be signed for if it's delivered today. Since the original statement doesn't provide any information about the signing process, we can't necessarily infer that the package will be signed for.\n\nHowever, we can say that if the package is delivered today, it's possible that it will be signed for, as signing is a common practice. But this is not a definitive inference, and we can't conclude that the package will definitely be signed for.\n\nAnswer: no",
