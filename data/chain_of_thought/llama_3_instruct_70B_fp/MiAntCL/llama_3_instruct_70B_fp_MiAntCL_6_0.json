            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can make this inference, let's break down the original statement and the proposed inference. The original statement is \"The concert might be sold out\", which indicates that there is a possibility that the concert is sold out. The proposed inference is \"The concert might be sold out and start at 8 PM\". \n\nTo make this inference, we need to consider whether the additional information \"start at 8 PM\" is implied or supported by the original statement. However, the original statement only mentions the possibility of the concert being sold out, but it does not provide any information about the start time of the concert. \n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the additional information \"start at 8 PM\" from the original statement. The original statement only provides information about the possibility of the concert being sold out, but it does not provide any information about the start time.\n\nAnswer: no",
