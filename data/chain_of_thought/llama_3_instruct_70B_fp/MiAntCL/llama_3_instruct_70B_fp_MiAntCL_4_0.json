It does not provide any information about the location of the meeting. The added clause \"and in the conference room\" introduces new information that is not present in the original statement. \n\nTo infer the new statement, we would need additional information that links the time of the meeting to its location, which is not provided. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude the new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: no",
