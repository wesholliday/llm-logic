This statement implies that there is a possibility that the document will be both signed and notarized.\n\nTo make this inference, we need to consider whether the possibility of the document being signed necessarily implies the possibility of it being both signed and notarized. \n\nIn general, signing a document is a necessary step before notarizing it, but notarizing is not a necessary step after signing. Therefore, if the document might be signed, it does not necessarily mean that it might be notarized as well.\n\nAnswer: no",
