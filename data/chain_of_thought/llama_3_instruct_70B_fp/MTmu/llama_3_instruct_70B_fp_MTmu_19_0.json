            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\" This can be represented as \"Tom watched football \u2192 Jen watched basketball.\" The second statement is the negation of the consequent: \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball,\" which can be represented as \"\u00ac(Jen watched basketball)\".\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule, we can infer the negation of the antecedent from the negation of the consequent. In this case, if we know that \"Tom watched football \u2192 Jen watched basketball\" and \"\u00ac(Jen watched basketball)\", we can conclude that \"\u00ac(Tom watched football)\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
