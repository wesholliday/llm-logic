            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the book was written by James\" and B is \"the book must be a mystery novel\".\n\nThe second statement is the negation of the conclusion of the first statement: \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel\". This can be represented as \"not B\".\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"The book was not written by James\" (not A) from these two statements. To do this, we can use a logical rule called modus tollens, which states that if we have \"If A, then B\" and \"not B\", we can conclude \"not A\".\n\nIn our case, we have \"If A, then B\" (the first statement) and \"not B\" (the second statement). Therefore, we can apply modus tollens to conclude \"not A\", which is \"The book was not written by James\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
