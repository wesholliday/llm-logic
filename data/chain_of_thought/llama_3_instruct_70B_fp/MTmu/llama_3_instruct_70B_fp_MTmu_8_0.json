            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"V \u2192 M\", where V represents \"the vampire was awake\" and M represents \"the mummy must have been awake\".\n2. \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake\" - This statement can be represented as \"\u00acM\", which means \"the mummy was not awake\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the vampire was awake (V), then the mummy must have been awake (M). This implies that if the mummy was not awake (\u00acM), then the vampire cannot be awake (\u00acV).\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the mummy was not awake (\u00acM). Using the implication from statement 1, we can conclude that the vampire was not awake (\u00acV).\n\nAnswer: yes",
