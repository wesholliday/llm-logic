            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe second statement is the negation of Q: \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as \"Not Q.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if P is true, then Q must be true. But the second statement tells us that Q is not true. Therefore, we can conclude that P cannot be true, because if P were true, then Q would have to be true, but we know that Q is not true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
