            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad.\" This can be represented as \"Ben ate pasta \u2192 Kate must have eaten the salad.\" The second statement is the negation of the consequent: \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad,\" which can be represented as \"\u00ac(Kate must have eaten the salad)\".\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule, we can infer that if the consequent is false, and the conditional statement is true, then the antecedent must be false. In this case, the antecedent is \"Ben ate pasta,\" and the consequent is \"Kate must have eaten the salad.\" Since the consequent is false (according to the second statement), and the conditional statement is true (given), we can conclude that the antecedent \"Ben ate pasta\" must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
