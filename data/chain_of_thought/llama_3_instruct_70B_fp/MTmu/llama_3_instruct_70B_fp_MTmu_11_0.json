            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins must have been blueberry\".\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry\" - This statement is the negation of Q, which can be represented as \"not Q\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Q is false (i.e., the muffins were not blueberry), and we know that \"If P, then Q\", then we can conclude that P must be false. This is because if P were true, then Q would have to be true (by the conditional statement), but we know Q is false.\n\nIn this case, P is \"the cake was chocolate\", so if we can conclude that P is false, then we can infer that \"The cake was not chocolate\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
