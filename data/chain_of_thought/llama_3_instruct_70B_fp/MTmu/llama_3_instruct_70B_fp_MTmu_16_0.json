            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\" This can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the shirt was cotton\" and B is \"the pants must have been denim\".\n\nThe second statement is the negation of the conclusion of the first statement: \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim\". This can be represented as \"Not B\".\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"The shirt was not cotton\" (Not A) from these two statements. To do this, we can use a technique called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: \"If A implies B, and Not B, then Not A\".\n\nIn our case, we have \"If A, then B\" (the first statement) and \"Not B\" (the second statement). Therefore, we can apply modus tollens to conclude \"Not A\", which is \"The shirt was not cotton\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
