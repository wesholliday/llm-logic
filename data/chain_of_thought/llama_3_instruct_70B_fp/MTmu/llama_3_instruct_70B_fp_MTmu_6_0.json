            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\". This can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q is \"Bob must have chosen pasta\". \n\nThe second statement is the negation of Q: \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta\", which can be represented as \"not Q\". \n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"Sue did not choose pizza\" (not P) from these two statements. \n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule, we can conclude that if \"If P, then Q\" is true and \"not Q\" is true, then \"not P\" must be true. \n\nIn this case, we have \"If P, then Q\" (the first statement) and \"not Q\" (the second statement), so we can apply modus tollens to conclude \"not P\", which is \"Sue did not choose pizza\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
