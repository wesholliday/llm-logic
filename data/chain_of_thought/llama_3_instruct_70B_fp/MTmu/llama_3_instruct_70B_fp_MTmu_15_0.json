            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin must have taken a train\".\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train\" - This statement can be represented as \"\u00acQ\", which means \"not Q\" or \"Q is false\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Q is false (Erin did not take a train), and we know that P \u2192 Q, then we can conclude that P must be false as well. This is because if P were true, then Q would have to be true (by the conditional statement), but we know Q is false. Therefore, P must be false to avoid a contradiction.\n\nIn this case, P is \"Sam took a plane\", so we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
