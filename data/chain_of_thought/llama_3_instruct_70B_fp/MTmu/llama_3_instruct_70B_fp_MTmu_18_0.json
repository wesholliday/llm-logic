            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" This can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck must have been metal.\"\n\nThe second statement is the negation of Q: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\" This can be represented as \"Not Q.\"\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"The doll was not plastic\" (Not P) from these two statements. To do this, we can use a rule of inference called modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q,\" we can infer \"Not P.\"\n\nIn our case, we have \"If P, then Q\" (the doll was plastic implies the truck must have been metal) and \"Not Q\" (it's not the case that the truck must have been metal). Therefore, we can apply modus tollens to infer \"Not P,\" which is \"The doll was not plastic.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
