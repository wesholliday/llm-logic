'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened' - This is a conditional statement. It implies that if the dreb was vroombed, then it would also be spened. However, since we know from statement 1 that the dreb was not vroombed, we cannot conclude that the dreb was spened.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n* If the dreb was vroombed, then it would be spened (according to statement 2).\n* But the dreb was not vroombed (according to statement 1).\n* Therefore, we cannot conclude that the dreb was spened.\n\nAnswer: yes",
