'If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished' - This statement implies that if the twonk was plinked, then it would necessarily be varnished. However, since we know from statement 1 that the twonk was not plinked, we cannot conclude that it was varnished.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n* If the twonk was plinked, then it would be varnished (by statement 2).\n* But the twonk was not plinked (by statement 1).\n* Therefore, we cannot conclude that the twonk was varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
