'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned' - This statement implies that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it would have surned. However, since we know from statement 1 that the fleeg was not bluttered, we cannot conclude that it surned.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n* If the fleeg was bluttered, then it would have surned (according to statement 2).\n* But the fleeg was not bluttered (according to statement 1).\n* Therefore, we cannot conclude that it surned.\n\nSince we cannot conclude that it surned, and we don't have any other information that suggests it did surn, we can infer that it did not surn.\n\nAnswer: yes",
