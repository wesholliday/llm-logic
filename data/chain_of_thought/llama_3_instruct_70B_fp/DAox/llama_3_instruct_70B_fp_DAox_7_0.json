'If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked' - This statement implies that if the whiffle was shanked, it would have tinked. However, since we know from statement 1 that the whiffle was not shanked, we can conclude that the condition for the whiffle to tink (i.e., being shanked) is not met.\n\nGiven that the condition for the whiffle to tink is not met, we can infer that the whiffle did not tink.\n\nAnswer: yes",
