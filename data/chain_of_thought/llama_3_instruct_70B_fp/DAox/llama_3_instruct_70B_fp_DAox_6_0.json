It says that if the grommet was sploffed, then it would have plopped the frink. However, we know from statement 1 that the grommet did not sploff. Therefore, the condition for the grommet to plop the frink is not met.\n\nSince the condition for the grommet to plop the frink is not met, we can infer that the grommet did not plop the frink.\n\nAnswer: yes",
