'If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled' - This is a conditional statement. It says that if the zinger was fraggled, then it would also be smoogled. However, since we know from statement 1 that the zinger is not fraggled, this conditional statement does not provide any information about the zinger being smoogled or not.\n\nSince we don't have any direct or indirect information about the zinger being smoogled or not, we cannot infer that 'The zinger was not smoogled'.\n\nAnswer: no",
