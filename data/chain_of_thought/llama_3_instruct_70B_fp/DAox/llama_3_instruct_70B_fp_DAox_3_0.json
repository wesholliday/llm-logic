'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked' - This statement sets up a conditional relationship between the splat being morphed and the splat quanking. It implies that if the splat was morphed, then it would have quanked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince the splat was not morphed (from statement 1), we can conclude that the condition for the splat to quank (i.e., being morphed) is not met. Therefore, we can infer that the splat did not quank.\n\nAnswer: yes",
