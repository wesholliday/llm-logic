'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged' - This is a conditional statement. It says that if the clug was fleeked, then it would have snugged. But we know from statement 1 that the clug is not fleeked. So, we can't conclude that the clug snugged just from this statement.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer from these two statements. Since the clug is not fleeked, and the only condition under which it would have snugged is if it was fleeked, we can conclude that the clug was not snugged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
