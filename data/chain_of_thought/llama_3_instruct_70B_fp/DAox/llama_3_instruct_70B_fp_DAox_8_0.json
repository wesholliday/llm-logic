'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled' - This is a conditional statement, which means that if the sprocket was cranked, then it would imply that the sprocket was daggled. However, since we know from statement 1 that the sprocket was not cranked, this conditional statement does not provide any direct information about whether the sprocket was daggled or not.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n* If the sprocket was cranked, then it would be daggled (according to statement 2).\n* But we know that the sprocket was not cranked (statement 1).\n* Therefore, we cannot conclude that the sprocket was daggled or not daggled based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
