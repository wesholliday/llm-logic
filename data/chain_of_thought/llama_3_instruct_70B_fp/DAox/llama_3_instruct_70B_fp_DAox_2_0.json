'If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint' - This is a conditional statement. It says that if the wug was flooped, then it would have bimmed the zoint. However, we know from statement 1 that the wug did not floop. Therefore, the condition for the wug to bim the zoint is not met.\n\nSince the condition for the wug to bim the zoint is not met (i.e., the wug was not flooped), we can infer that the wug did not bim the zoint.\n\nAnswer: yes",
