'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked' - This statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the fribble was snurgled, then it would have crinked. However, since we know from statement 1 that the fribble was not snurgled, this conditional statement does not provide any direct information about whether the fribble crinked or not.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n* If the fribble was snurgled, then it would have crinked (according to statement 2).\n* But we know that the fribble was not snurgled (according to statement 1).\n* Therefore, we cannot conclude that the fribble crinked or did not crink based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
