'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated' - This is a conditional statement. It says that if the flob was skizzled, then it would have movated. But we know from statement 1 that the flob was not skizzled. So, the condition for the flob to movate is not met.\n\nSince the condition for the flob to movate is not met, we can infer that the flob did not movate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
