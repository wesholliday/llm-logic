It implies that if the wug is sproinged, then it must also be garpled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince the wug is not sproinged (from statement 1), we can't conclude that it's garpled based on the conditional relationship in statement 2. However, we can use modus tollens to infer the conclusion.\n\nModus tollens is a logical rule that states: if P \u2192 Q and not Q, then not P. In our case:\n\n* P: The wug was sproinged\n* Q: The wug was garpled\n\nWe know that not P (the wug was not sproinged), and we have the conditional relationship P \u2192 Q. Using modus tollens, we can conclude that not Q, which means the wug was not garpled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
