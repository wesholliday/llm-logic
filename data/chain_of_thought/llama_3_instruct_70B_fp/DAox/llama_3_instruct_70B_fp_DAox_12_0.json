It says that if the smip was shripped, then it would have lupped the zoint. But we know from statement 1 that the smip was not shripped. So, the condition for the smip to lup the zoint is not met.\n\nSince the condition for the smip to lup the zoint is not met, we can infer that the smip did not lup the zoint.\n\nAnswer: yes",
