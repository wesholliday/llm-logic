'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed' - This statement sets up a conditional relationship between the flug being blummed and the flug being zimmed. It implies that if the flug is blummed, then it must also be zimmed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince the flug is not blummed (from statement 1), we cannot conclude that the flug is zimmed based on the conditional relationship in statement 2. However, we can use modus tollens to infer that if the flug is not blummed, then it cannot be zimmed either.\n\nAnswer: yes",
