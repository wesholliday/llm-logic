It says that if the sneg is crampled, then it must have sproted the frink. However, since we know from statement 1 that the sneg is not crampled, this conditional statement does not apply.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n* If the sneg was crampled, then it would have sproted the frink (according to statement 2).\n* But the sneg is not crampled (according to statement 1).\n* Therefore, the condition for the sneg to sprot the frink is not met.\n\nAnswer: yes",
