            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The zibber might be froodle\" implies that there is a possibility that the zibber is froodle. To infer \"The zibber might be froodle or on wibble\", we need to consider whether adding the possibility of \"on wibble\" is a logical extension of the original statement.\n\nIn general, when we say \"A might be B\", it implies that A has a possibility of being B, but it does not rule out other possibilities. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that A might also be something else, say C. In this case, \"The zibber might be froodle\" implies that the zibber has a possibility of being froodle, but it does not rule out the possibility of the zibber being something else, including \"on wibble\".\n\nSince the original statement does not provide any information that contradicts the possibility of the zibber being \"on wibble\", we can infer that the zibber might be froodle or on wibble.\n\nAnswer: yes",
