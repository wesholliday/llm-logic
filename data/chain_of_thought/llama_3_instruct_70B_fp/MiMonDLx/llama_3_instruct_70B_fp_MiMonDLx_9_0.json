This statement implies that there is a possibility that the frazzle is wump.\n\nThe proposed inference is 'The frazzle might be wump or quimble'. This statement implies that there is a possibility that the frazzle is either wump or quimble.\n\nSince the original statement already implies that the frazzle might be wump, adding the possibility of quimble does not contradict the original statement. In fact, it expands the possibilities, but it does not change the core idea that the frazzle might be wump.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the frazzle might be wump, then it is also possible that the frazzle might be wump or quimble, as the latter includes the former as one of the possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes",
