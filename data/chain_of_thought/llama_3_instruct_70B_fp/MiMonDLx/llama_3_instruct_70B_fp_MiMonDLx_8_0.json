This statement is saying that there is a possibility that the gribble is either quork or grazzle.\n\nSince the original statement already implies that the gribble might be quork, adding the possibility of it being grazzle as well does not contradict the original statement. In fact, it's a broader statement that includes the original possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
