            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The plimp might be wobble\" implies that there is a possibility that the plimp is wobble. When we add \"or blimple\" to the statement, we are essentially expanding the possibilities. The new statement \"The plimp might be wobble or blimple\" includes the original possibility (that the plimp is wobble) and adds an additional possibility (that the plimp is blimple). \n\nSince the new statement includes the original possibility, it is a broader claim that encompasses the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, the new statement must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
