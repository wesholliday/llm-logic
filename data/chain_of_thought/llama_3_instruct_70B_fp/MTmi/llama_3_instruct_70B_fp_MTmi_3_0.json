            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the book was written by James\" and B is \"the book must be a mystery novel\". \n\nThe second statement is \"The book might not be a mystery novel\", which can be represented as \"not B\". \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"The book was not written by James\" (not A) from the given statements. \n\nIn logic, if we have \"If A, then B\" and \"not B\", we can conclude \"not A\" using modus tollens. This is exactly the situation we have here. \n\nAnswer: yes",
