            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Tom watches football \u2192 Jen watches basketball\".\n2. \"Jen might not have watched basketball\" - This statement can be represented as \"\u00ac(Jen watches basketball)\" or \"Jen does not watch basketball\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Tom watched football, then according to statement 1, Jen must have watched basketball. However, statement 2 tells us that Jen might not have watched basketball. This creates a contradiction, as Tom watching football would imply Jen watching basketball, but we know that Jen might not have watched basketball.\n\nTo resolve this contradiction, we need to revisit the assumption that Tom watched football. If Tom did not watch football, then the conditional statement in 1 would not be triggered, and we would not have a contradiction with statement 2.\n\nAnswer: yes",
