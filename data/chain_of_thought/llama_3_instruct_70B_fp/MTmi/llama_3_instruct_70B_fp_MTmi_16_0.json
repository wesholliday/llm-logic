            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\" This can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the shirt was cotton\" and B is \"the pants must have been denim\". \n\nThe second statement is \"The pants might not have been denim\", which can be represented as \"Not B\" (the pants were not denim). \n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. If the pants were not denim (Not B), and we know that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim (If A, then B), then it's possible that the shirt was not cotton (Not A). This is because if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would have been denim, but we know the pants were not denim. \n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
