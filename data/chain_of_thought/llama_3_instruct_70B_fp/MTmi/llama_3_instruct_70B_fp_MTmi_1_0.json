            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" - This implies that if Mary was present, Sue's presence is guaranteed.\n2. \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\" - This statement introduces doubt about Sue's presence at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\na) If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary cannot be at the wedding (due to statement 1). This is because if Mary was present, Sue would have been present too, which contradicts the assumption that Sue was not present.\n\nb) If Sue was at the wedding, we cannot conclude anything about Mary's presence. Mary could be present or not present.\n\nGiven the uncertainty about Sue's presence, we can infer that if Sue might not have been at the wedding, then Mary's presence is unlikely. This is because if Mary was present, Sue would have been present too, which contradicts the doubt about Sue's presence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
