            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\". This statement implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\n2. \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\" - This statement can be represented as \"Not Q\", which negates the conclusion of the first statement.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Mark might not have bought the blue shirt (Not Q), and we know that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt (If P, then Q), then we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt (Not P). This is because if Lisa had bought the red shirt, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt, but we know that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
