            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck must have been metal\". This statement implies that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal, but it doesn't provide any information about the converse (i.e., if the doll was not plastic, then the truck might or might not have been metal).\n\n2. \"The truck might not have been metal\" - This statement is a negation of Q, implying that it's possible that the truck was not metal.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\na. If the doll was plastic (P), then the truck must have been metal (Q) according to statement 1.\nb. But statement 2 says the truck might not have been metal (~Q).\nc. Since ~Q is true, and Q is a consequence of P, we can infer that P (the doll was plastic) cannot be true. If P were true, then Q would be true, but we know ~Q is true, so P must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
