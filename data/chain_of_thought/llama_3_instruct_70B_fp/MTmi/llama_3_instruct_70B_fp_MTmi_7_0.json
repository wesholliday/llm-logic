In other words, Alex finishing the race is a sufficient condition for Chris to finish the race.\n\n2. \"Chris might not have finished the race\" - This statement suggests that there is a possibility that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Chris might not have finished the race, and Alex finishing the race implies Chris finishing the race, then it's possible that Alex did not finish the race. Because if Alex had finished the race, then Chris would have definitely finished the race, but we know that Chris might not have finished the race.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race, as it's the only possibility that aligns with the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
