This statement implies that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must also have been awake.\n\n2. \"The mummy might not have been awake\" - This statement can be represented as \"\u00acM\", which means \"it is possible that the mummy was not awake\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the mummy might not have been awake (\u00acM), and we know that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake (V \u2192 M), then we can conclude that the vampire was not awake. This is because if the vampire were awake, the mummy would have been awake too (due to V \u2192 M), but we know that the mummy might not have been awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
