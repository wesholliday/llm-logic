But statement 2 says that Bob might not have chosen pasta, which contradicts the conclusion we drew from statement 1. This means that the assumption \"Sue chose pizza\" leads to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the assumption \"Sue chose pizza\" must be false, which means Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
