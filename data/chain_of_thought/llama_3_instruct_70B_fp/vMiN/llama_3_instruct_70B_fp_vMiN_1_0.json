            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise states that Mary might not have been at the wedding, which implies that there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding. The conclusion states that it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding, which means that it's not necessarily true that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nThe key to this argument is the distinction between \"might not\" and \"must not\". \"Might not\" implies a possibility, whereas \"must not\" implies a necessity. The premise is saying that it's possible that Mary was not at the wedding, while the conclusion is saying that it's not necessary that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nLogically, if it's possible that Mary was not at the wedding (as stated in the premise), then it's not necessary that Mary was at the wedding (as stated in the conclusion). This means that the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
