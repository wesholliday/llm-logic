            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" implies that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza. This means that we cannot be certain that Sue chose pizza. \n\nOn the other hand, \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" means that it is not necessarily true that Sue chose pizza. This statement is also implying that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nSince both statements are implying the same thing, which is that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza, we can infer that \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" from \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
