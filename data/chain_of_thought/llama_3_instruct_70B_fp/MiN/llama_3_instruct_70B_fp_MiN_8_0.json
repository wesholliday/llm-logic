This is equivalent to saying that it's not certain that the vampire was awake. \n\nNow, let's analyze the statement \"It's not the case that the vampire must have been awake\". This statement is saying that it's not true that the vampire necessarily had to be awake. This is consistent with the original statement, as \"might not have been awake\" implies that there's a possibility the vampire wasn't awake, which means it's not necessary that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
