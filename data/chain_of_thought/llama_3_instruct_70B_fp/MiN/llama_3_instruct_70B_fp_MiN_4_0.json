This statement implies that it's possible that the alien did not visit Mars. In other words, it's not certain that the alien visited Mars.\n\nThe desired conclusion is \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars\". This statement is equivalent to saying that it's not necessarily true that the alien visited Mars.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship between the two statements. If it's possible that the alien did not visit Mars (given statement), then it's not necessarily true that the alien visited Mars (desired conclusion). In other words, if there's a chance that the alien didn't visit Mars, then we can't conclude that the alien must have visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
