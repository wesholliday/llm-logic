This means that we cannot be certain that the shoes are in the closet. \n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet\" is equivalent to saying that it's not necessarily true that the shoes are in the closet. This is consistent with the original statement, as \"might not be\" implies that it's not necessary for the shoes to be in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
