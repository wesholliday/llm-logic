This statement implies that there is a possibility that the griffin was not in the forest. It does not assert that the griffin was definitely not in the forest, but rather that it's possible that it wasn't.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we're trying to infer: \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\". This statement is saying that it's not necessarily true that the griffin had to be in the forest.\n\nIf the griffin might not have been in the forest, it means that there's a possibility it wasn't in the forest. This possibility implies that it's not necessarily true that the griffin had to be in the forest. In other words, if there's a chance the griffin wasn't in the forest, then it's not the case that it must have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
