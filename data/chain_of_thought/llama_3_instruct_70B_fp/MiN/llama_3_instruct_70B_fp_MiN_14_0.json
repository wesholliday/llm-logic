            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The milk might not be on the counter\" implies that there is a possibility that the milk is not on the counter. This means that we cannot be certain that the milk is on the counter. \n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter\" is equivalent to saying that it's not necessarily true that the milk is on the counter. This is consistent with the original statement, as \"might not\" implies that there is a possibility of the milk not being on the counter, which in turn implies that it's not necessarily true that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
