This means that we cannot be certain that the notebook is in the drawer. \n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer\" is equivalent to saying that it's not necessarily true that the notebook is in the drawer. This is consistent with the original statement, as \"might not be\" implies that it's not necessarily the case that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
