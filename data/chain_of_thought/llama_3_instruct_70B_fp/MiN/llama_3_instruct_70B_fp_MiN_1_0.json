            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" implies that there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding. This means that we cannot be certain that Mary was at the wedding. \n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" is equivalent to saying that we do not have sufficient evidence to conclude that Mary's presence at the wedding is a necessity or a certainty.\n\nGiven that \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" implies uncertainty about Mary's presence, it follows that we cannot conclude that Mary's presence is a necessity or a certainty. Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
