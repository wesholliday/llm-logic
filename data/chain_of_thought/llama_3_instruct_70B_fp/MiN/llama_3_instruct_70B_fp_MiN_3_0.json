This statement implies that there is a possibility that the book was not written by James. It does not provide any information about whether the book must have been written by James or not. \n\nNow, let's analyze the statement we want to infer: \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James\". This statement is equivalent to saying that it's not necessary that the book was written by James. \n\nSince the original statement only provides information about the possibility of the book not being written by James, but does not provide any information about necessity, we can infer that it's not necessary that the book was written by James. \n\nAnswer: yes",
