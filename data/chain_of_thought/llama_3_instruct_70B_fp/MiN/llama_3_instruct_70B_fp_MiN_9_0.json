            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\" implies that there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This means that we cannot be certain that Lisa bought the red shirt. \n\nOn the other hand, \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" means that it's not necessarily true that Lisa bought the red shirt. This statement is denying the necessity of Lisa buying the red shirt, which is consistent with the possibility that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt.\n\nSince the first statement implies uncertainty about Lisa buying the red shirt, and the second statement denies the necessity of Lisa buying the red shirt, we can infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
