            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand\" - This statement negates the possibility that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand. It doesn't say it's not sitting on the nightstand, but rather that it's not necessarily the case.\n\n2. \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\" - This statement presents two possibilities: the notebook is in the drawer, or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements. Since the first statement negates the possibility that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand, we can conclude that the second possibility in the second statement is false. This means the first possibility in the second statement, \"the notebook is in the drawer\", must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
