It doesn't say the jacket is not hanging in the closet, but rather that it's not necessarily the case.\n\n2. \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" - This statement presents two possibilities: the jacket is either draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements. Since the first statement negates the possibility that the jacket must be hanging in the closet, we can conclude that the second possibility in the second statement is false. This leaves us with only one possibility: the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
