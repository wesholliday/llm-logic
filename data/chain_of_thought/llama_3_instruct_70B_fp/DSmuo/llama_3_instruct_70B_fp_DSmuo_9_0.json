The first statement says \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor\", which means the puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor. The second statement says \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor\". This is an \"or\" statement, which means that if one option is false, the other option must be true.\n\nSince we know the puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor (from the first statement), the \"or\" statement implies that the only remaining option is true, which is that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
