            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" - This statement negates the idea that the book must be on the table. It doesn't say the book can't be on the table, but rather that it's not necessarily the case.\n\n2. \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" - This statement presents two possibilities: the book is on the shelf, or it must be on the table. The key word here is \"must\", which implies a necessity or obligation.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements. If it's not the case that the book must be on the table (from statement 1), then the \"must\" part in statement 2 is ruled out. This leaves us with the other possibility: the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
