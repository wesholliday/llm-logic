            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\", which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim\". We also know that the antecedent \"P\" is true, i.e., \"The shirt was cotton\". \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the antecedent is true, and the statement is true, then the consequent must also be true. This is a fundamental rule of inference in logic, often referred to as modus ponens. \n\nSo, in this case, since we know \"P\" is true, and \"If P, then Q\" is true, we can infer that \"Q\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
