We have a conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" which can be represented as \"Sue chose pizza \u2192 Bob chose pasta\". This statement implies that if the condition \"Sue chose pizza\" is true, then the conclusion \"Bob chose pasta\" must also be true. \n\nWe are also given the statement \"Sue chose pizza\", which means the condition of the conditional statement is satisfied. \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"Bob chose pasta\" from these two statements. Since the condition of the conditional statement is true, and the conditional statement implies that if the condition is true then the conclusion must also be true, we can conclude that \"Bob chose pasta\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
