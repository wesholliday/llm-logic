            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow\". We also have a statement \"The apple was red\" which is the same as P.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"The banana was yellow\" (Q) from the given statements. In a conditional statement, if the condition (P) is true, then the conclusion (Q) must also be true. Since we know P is true (the apple was red), we can conclude that Q must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
