We have a conditional statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\" which can be represented as \"Ben ate pasta \u2192 Kate ate the salad\". This statement implies that if the condition \"Ben ate pasta\" is true, then the conclusion \"Kate ate the salad\" must also be true. \n\nWe are also given the statement \"Ben ate pasta\", which means the condition of the conditional statement is satisfied. \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"Kate ate the salad\" from these two statements. Since the condition \"Ben ate pasta\" is true, and the conditional statement \"Ben ate pasta \u2192 Kate ate the salad\" is also true, we can conclude that \"Kate ate the salad\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
