            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional statement and its antecedent. The conditional statement is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis', which can be written in symbolic form as 'J \u2192 A', where 'J' represents 'Jeff played basketball' and 'A' represents 'Amy played tennis'. The antecedent is 'Jeff played basketball', which is 'J'.\n\nTo infer 'Amy played tennis', we need to see if we can logically conclude 'A' from the given statements. Since 'J \u2192 A' is a conditional statement, it means that if 'J' is true, then 'A' must also be true. We are given that 'J' is true, so we can apply modus ponens, a rule of inference that states that if 'J \u2192 A' is true and 'J' is true, then 'A' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
