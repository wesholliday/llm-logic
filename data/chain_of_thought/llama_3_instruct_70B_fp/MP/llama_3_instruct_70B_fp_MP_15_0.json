We have a conditional statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\", which can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin took a train\". We are also given that \"Sam took a plane\", which is P.\n\nIn a conditional statement, if the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true. This is known as modus ponens. Since we know P is true, we can infer that Q must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
