            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\", which can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the book was written by James\" and B is \"the book is a mystery novel\". We are also given the statement \"The book was written by James\", which is the same as A.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"The book is a mystery novel\" (B) from the given statements. Since we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we are given A, we can apply modus ponens, a rule of inference that states if A is true and \"If A, then B\" is true, then B must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
