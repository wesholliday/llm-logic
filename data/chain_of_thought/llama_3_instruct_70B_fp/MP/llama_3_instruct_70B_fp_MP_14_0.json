We have a conditional statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\", which can be represented as \"If A, then B\". We also have a statement \"The bear was in the cave\", which is the antecedent (A) of the conditional statement. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the antecedent (A) is true, and the statement is of the form \"If A, then B\", then we can infer that the consequent (B) is also true. In this case, since we know the bear was in the cave (A is true), we can infer that the wolf was in the den (B is true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
