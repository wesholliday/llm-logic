            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\", which can be represented as \"Tom watched football \u2192 Jen watched basketball\". This statement implies that if the condition \"Tom watched football\" is true, then the consequence \"Jen watched basketball\" must also be true. \n\nWe are also given the statement \"Tom watched football\", which means the condition of the conditional statement is satisfied. \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"Jen watched basketball\" from these two statements. Since the condition of the conditional statement is true, and the conditional statement implies that if the condition is true then the consequence must also be true, we can conclude that the consequence \"Jen watched basketball\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
