We have a conditional statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\", which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue\". We also have a statement \"The car was red\", which is the same as P.\n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (P) is true, then the conclusion (Q) must also be true. Since we know that P is true (the car was red), we can infer that Q must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
