We have a conditional statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\", which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\". We also have the statement \"Lisa bought the red shirt\", which is the antecedent P of the conditional statement.\n\nIn a conditional statement, if the antecedent P is true, then the consequent Q must also be true. In this case, we know that P is true, so we can infer that Q is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
