            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\", which can be represented as \"M \u2192 S\", where M represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S represents \"Sue was at the wedding\". We also have the statement \"Mary was at the wedding\", which is simply M.\n\nTo infer \"Sue was at the wedding\" (S), we need to see if we can logically deduce it from the given statements. Since we have M \u2192 S, it means that if M is true, then S must also be true. And we are given that M is indeed true. Therefore, we can conclude that S must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
