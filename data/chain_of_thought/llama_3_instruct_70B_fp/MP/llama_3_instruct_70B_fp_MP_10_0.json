            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"the dog was inside\" and Q is \"the cat was outside\". We also have a statement \"The dog was inside\" which is the same as P.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"The cat was outside\" (Q) from the given statements. Since we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true (the dog was inside), we can apply modus ponens, a valid inference rule in logic. Modus ponens states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and P, we can conclude Q.\n\nAnswer: yes",
