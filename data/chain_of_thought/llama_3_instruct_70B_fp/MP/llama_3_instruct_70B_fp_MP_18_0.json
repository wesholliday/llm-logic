            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal\". We are also given that \"The doll was plastic\" which is the same as P.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"The truck was metal\" which is the same as Q. Since we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, we can apply modus ponens, a valid inference rule in logic. Modus ponens states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and P, we can conclude Q.\n\nIn this case, we have \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" and \"The doll was plastic\", so we can conclude \"The truck was metal\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
