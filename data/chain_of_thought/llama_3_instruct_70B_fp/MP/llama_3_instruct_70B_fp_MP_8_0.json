            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\", which can be represented as \"V \u2192 M\", where V represents \"the vampire was awake\" and M represents \"the mummy was awake\". This statement implies that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake. \n\nWe are also given the statement \"The vampire was awake\", which is V. \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"The mummy was awake\" (M) from these two statements. \n\nSince we know V \u2192 M and we are given V, we can apply modus ponens, a valid inference rule in logic. Modus ponens states that if we have V \u2192 M and V, we can conclude M. \n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The mummy was awake\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
