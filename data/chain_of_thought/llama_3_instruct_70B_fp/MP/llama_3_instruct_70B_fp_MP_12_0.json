We have a conditional statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\", which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo\". We also have the statement \"Joe went to the park\", which is the antecedent P.\n\nIn a conditional statement, if the antecedent P is true, then the consequent Q must also be true. In this case, we know that P is true (Joe went to the park), so we can infer that Q must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
