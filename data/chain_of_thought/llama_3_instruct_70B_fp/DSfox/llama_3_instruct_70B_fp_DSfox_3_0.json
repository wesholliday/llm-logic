It's an \"or\" statement, which means only one of the options needs to be true.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from both statements. We know the splat is not quanked (from statement 1). If it's not quanked, then the only other possibility left is that it is morphed (from statement 2). This is because the \"or\" statement in the second sentence implies that if one option is not true, the other option must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
