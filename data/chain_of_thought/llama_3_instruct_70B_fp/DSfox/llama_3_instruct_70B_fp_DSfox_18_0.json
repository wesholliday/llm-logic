It's an \"or\" statement, which means only one of the options needs to be true.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from both statements. We know the shank is not nugged (from statement 1). But statement 2 says it's either nugged or plooked. Since it's not nugged, the only remaining option is that it must be plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
