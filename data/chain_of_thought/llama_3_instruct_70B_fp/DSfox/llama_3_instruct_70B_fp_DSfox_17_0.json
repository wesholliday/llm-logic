It's an \"or\" statement, which means only one of the options needs to be true.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from both statements. We know the flob is not movated (from statement 1). Since the flob is not movated, the only remaining possibility from statement 2 is that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
