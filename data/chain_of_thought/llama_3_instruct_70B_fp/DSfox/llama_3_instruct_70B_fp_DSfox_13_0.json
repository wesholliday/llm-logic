'Either the glip is tragged or it is slogged' - This statement presents two possibilities: the glip is either tragged or slogged. Since we know from statement 1 that the glip is not tragged, we can eliminate the first possibility.\n\n3. Now, we are left with the second possibility: the glip is slogged. Since the statement 'Either the glip is tragged or it is slogged' is true, and the glip is not tragged, it must be slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
