It's an \"or\" statement, which means only one of the options needs to be true.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from both statements. We know the clug is not snugged (from statement 1). The second statement says it's either snugged or fleeked. Since it's not snugged, the only remaining option is that it must be fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
