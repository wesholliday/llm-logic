Since we know from statement 1 that the smonk is not plagged, we can eliminate the first possibility.\n\nNow, we are left with the second possibility: the smonk is vreebled. Since the \"or\" in the second statement is an inclusive or (i.e., it's not an exclusive or), we can conclude that if the smonk is not plagged, then it must be vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
