'Either the wug is bimmed or it is flooped' - This statement presents us with two possibilities: the wug is either bimmed or flooped. However, we already know from statement 1 that the wug is not bimmed.\n\n3. Since the wug is not bimmed, and we have only two possibilities (bimmed or flooped), we can conclude that the wug must be flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
