It's an \"or\" statement, which means only one of the options needs to be true.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from both statements. We know the sprocket is not daggled (from statement 1). The second statement says it's either daggled or cranked. Since it's not daggled, the only remaining possibility is that it's cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
