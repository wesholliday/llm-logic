Since we know from statement 1 that the fribble is not crinked, we can eliminate the first possibility.\n\nNow, we are left with the second possibility: the fribble is snurgled. Since the \"or\" in the second statement is an inclusive or (i.e., it's not an exclusive or), and we've eliminated the first possibility, we can conclude that the fribble must be snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
