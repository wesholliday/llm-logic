It's an \"or\" statement, which means only one of the options needs to be true.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from both statements. We know the flug is not zimmed (from statement 1). Since the flug is not zimmed, the only remaining possibility from statement 2 is that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
