It's an \"either-or\" statement, which means that one of the two options must be true. The two options are:\n\na) The whiffle is tinked\nb) The whiffle is shanked\n\nWe already know from statement 1 that option a) is false (the whiffle is not tinked). Therefore, the only remaining option is b) The whiffle is shanked.\n\nSince the \"either-or\" statement must be true, and one of the options is false, the other option must be true. In this case, that means the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
