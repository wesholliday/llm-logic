'Either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed' - This statement presents two possibilities: the flugel is either zargled or blimmed. Since we know from statement 1 that the flugel is not zargled, we can eliminate the first possibility.\n\nNow, we are left with the second possibility: the flugel is blimmed. Since the statement 'Either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed' is true, and the flugel is not zargled, the only remaining option is that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
