Since we know from statement 1 that the sneg is not sproted, we can eliminate the first possibility.\n\nNow, we are left with the second possibility: the sneg is crampled. Since the \"either-or\" statement is an inclusive disjunction, and we have eliminated one of the options, we can conclude that the remaining option must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
