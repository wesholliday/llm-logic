            "content": "Explanation: To determine the validity of this argument, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the premise and the conclusion. The premise states \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\", which can be rewritten as \"Mary doesn't necessarily have to be at the wedding\". This implies that Mary's presence at the wedding is not a guaranteed or necessary condition.\n\nThe conclusion states \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\", which means that it's possible that Mary was not at the wedding. This conclusion is consistent with the premise, as it doesn't contradict the idea that Mary's presence is not necessary.\n\nIn logical terms, the premise is denying a necessity (Mary must have been at the wedding), and the conclusion is asserting a possibility (Mary might not have been at the wedding). This is a valid inference, as the denial of a necessity implies the possibility of the opposite.\n\nAnswer: yes",
