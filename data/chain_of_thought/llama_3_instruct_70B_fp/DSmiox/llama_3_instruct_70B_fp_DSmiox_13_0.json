'Either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged' - This statement presents two possibilities: the glip is slogged, or it must be tragged.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If the glip is slogged, then the second statement is true, and we can't infer anything more.\n* If the glip is not slogged, then the second statement implies that it must be tragged. However, the first statement says that the glip might not be tragged, which contradicts the idea that it must be tragged.\n\nSince we can't reconcile the idea that the glip is not slogged with the given statements, we are left with the possibility that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
