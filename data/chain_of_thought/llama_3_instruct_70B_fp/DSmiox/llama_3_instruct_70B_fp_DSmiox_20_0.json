However, this contradicts the first statement, which says that the fleeg might not be surned.\n\nSince we can't reconcile the two statements, we can't infer that the fleeg is bluttered. The statements are ambiguous, and we need more information to determine the truth about the fleeg.\n\nAnswer: no",
