'Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled' is a classic \"or\" statement, which means that at least one of the conditions must be true. If the flugel is blimmed, the statement is true. If the flugel is not blimmed, then it must be zargled for the statement to be true.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from both statements. If the flugel might not be zargled (from statement 1), and it must be zargled if it's not blimmed (from statement 2), then the only way to satisfy both statements is if the flugel is indeed blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
