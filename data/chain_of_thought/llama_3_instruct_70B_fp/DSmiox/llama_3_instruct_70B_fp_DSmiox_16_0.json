If it's not sproted, then according to statement 2, the only other possibility is that the sneg is crampled.\n\nHowever, we can't conclude that the sneg is definitely crampled. The first statement only says that it might not be sproted, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that it is sproted. If it is sproted, then we can't infer that it's crampled.\n\nAnswer: no",
