If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n\nThe second premise is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q is \"Bob chose pasta\". \n\nFrom the first premise, we know that P is true, i.e., Sue chose pizza. Now, we can apply the conditional statement. Since P is true, we can infer that Q must also be true, i.e., Bob chose pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
