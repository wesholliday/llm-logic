It can be rewritten as \"Alien visits Mars \u2192 Robot visits Jupiter\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nWe know the alien visited Mars (statement 1). The conditional statement (2) tells us that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. Since the condition \"Alien visits Mars\" is true, we can infer the conclusion \"Robot visits Jupiter\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
