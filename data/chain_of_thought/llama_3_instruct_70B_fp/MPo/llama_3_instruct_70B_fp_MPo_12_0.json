It says that if the condition \"Joe went to the park\" is true, then the consequence \"Lucy went to the zoo\" must also be true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nWe know that Joe went to the park (from statement 1). This means the condition in the conditional statement (statement 2) is satisfied. According to the conditional statement, if the condition is true, then the consequence must also be true. Therefore, we can conclude that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: yes",
