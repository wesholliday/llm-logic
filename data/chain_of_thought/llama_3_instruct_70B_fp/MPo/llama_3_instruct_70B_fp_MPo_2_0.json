'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest' - This statement is a conditional statement, which means it sets a condition (the griffin being in the forest) and a consequence (the unicorn being in the forest).\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nWe know the griffin was in the forest (from statement 1). The conditional statement (2) says that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is also in the forest. Since the condition (griffin in the forest) is true, we can infer the consequence (unicorn in the forest).\n\nAnswer: yes",
