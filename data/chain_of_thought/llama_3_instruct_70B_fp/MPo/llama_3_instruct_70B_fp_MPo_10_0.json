'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' - This is a conditional statement, which means it sets a condition (the dog being inside) and a consequence (the cat being outside).\n\nNow, let's analyze these premises together. We know the dog was inside (from premise 1), and we also know that if the dog is inside, then the cat is outside (from premise 2). Since the condition in premise 2 is met (the dog is indeed inside), we can conclude that the consequence must also be true, which is the cat being outside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
