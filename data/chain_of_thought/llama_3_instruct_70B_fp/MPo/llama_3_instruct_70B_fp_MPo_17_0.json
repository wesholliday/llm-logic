The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it has an antecedent ('Ben ate pasta') and a consequent ('Kate ate the salad'). \n\nThe antecedent 'Ben ate pasta' is already true, as given in the first statement. Now, according to the conditional statement, if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true. Therefore, we can conclude that the consequent 'Kate ate the salad' is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
