'Lisa bought the red shirt' - This is a simple statement that tells us about Lisa's action.\n2. 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' - This is a conditional statement that sets a condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) and a consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt).\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer 'Mark bought the blue shirt' from these two statements. Since we have the first statement, which satisfies the condition in the second statement (Lisa buying the red shirt), we can conclude that the consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
