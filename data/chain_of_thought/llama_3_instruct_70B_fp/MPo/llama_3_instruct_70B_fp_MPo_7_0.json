'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' - This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition 'Alex finished the race' is true, then the conclusion 'Chris finished the race' must also be true.\n\nSince we know that Alex finished the race (from statement 1), we can apply the conditional statement (statement 2). The condition is satisfied, so we can infer the conclusion, which is 'Chris finished the race'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
