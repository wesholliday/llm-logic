If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n\nThe second premise is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the vampire was awake\" and Q is \"the mummy was awake\". \n\nFrom the first premise, we know that P is true (the vampire was awake). Now, we can apply the conditional statement. Since P is true, and the conditional statement says \"If P, then Q\", we can conclude that Q must also be true. \n\nIn this case, Q is \"the mummy was awake\". Therefore, we can infer that the mummy was awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
