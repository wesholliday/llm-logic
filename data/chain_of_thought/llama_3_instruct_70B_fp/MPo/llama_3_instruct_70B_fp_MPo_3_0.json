The \"if\" part is the condition, and the \"then\" part is the consequence. In this case, the condition is \"the book was written by James\", and the consequence is \"the book is a mystery novel\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nWe are given that the book was written by James (statement 1). This satisfies the condition in the conditional statement (statement 2). According to the conditional statement, if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. Since the condition is true, we can infer the consequence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
