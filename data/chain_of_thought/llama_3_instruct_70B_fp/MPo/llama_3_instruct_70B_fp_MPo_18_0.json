            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have two premises: \n\n1. The doll was plastic.\n2. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nThe second premise is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal\". \n\nFrom the first premise, we know that P is true (the doll was plastic). Now, we can apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if P is true and \"If P, then Q\" is true, then Q must also be true. \n\nIn this case, since we know the doll was plastic (P is true) and we have the conditional statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" (If P, then Q), we can conclude that the truck was metal (Q is true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
