If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n\nThe second premise is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry\". \n\nFrom the first premise, we know that P is true (the cake was indeed chocolate). \n\nNow, we can apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, then we can conclude that Q is also true.\n\nIn this case, since we know that the cake was chocolate (P is true), and we have the conditional statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\", we can infer that the muffins were blueberry (Q is true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
