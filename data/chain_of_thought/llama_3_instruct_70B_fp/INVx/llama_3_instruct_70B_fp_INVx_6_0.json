            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can make this inference, let's analyze the original statement: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the grommet was sploffed\" and B is \"the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n\nThe inference we're considering is \"If the grommet was not sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink.\" This can be represented as \"If not A, then not B.\" This type of inference is known as the contrapositive, which is a valid logical rule.\n\nThe contrapositive states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B,\" we can infer \"If not B, then not A.\" However, in this case, we're trying to infer \"If not A, then not B,\" which is not exactly the same. But, we can use the contrapositive to help us.\n\nLet's apply the contrapositive to the original statement: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\" This gives us \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\" Now, we can see that this is equivalent to \"If not A, then not B,\" which is what we were trying to infer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
