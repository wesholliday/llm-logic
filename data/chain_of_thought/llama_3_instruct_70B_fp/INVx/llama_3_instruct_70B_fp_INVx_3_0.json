            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can make this inference, let's analyze the original statement: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\" or \"A \u2192 B\". \n\nIn this case, A is \"the splat was morphed\" and B is \"the splat quanked\". The original statement asserts that if A is true, then B must also be true. \n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank\". This can be represented as \"If not A, then not B\" or \"\u00acA \u2192 \u00acB\". \n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we can use the rule of contrapositive, which states that \"A \u2192 B\" is equivalent to \"\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA\". \n\nIn our case, the original statement \"A \u2192 B\" is equivalent to \"\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA\". Now, we can see that \"\u00acA \u2192 \u00acB\" is the contrapositive of \"\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA\", which means they are equivalent. \n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer \"If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
