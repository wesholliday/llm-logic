            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can make this inference, let's analyze the original statement: \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"P \u2192 N\", where \"P\" stands for \"the shank was plooked\" and \"N\" stands for \"the shank was nugged\".\n\nThe inference we're asked to consider is \"If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged\", which can be represented as \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acN\". Here, \"\u00ac\" denotes negation, so \"\u00acP\" means \"the shank was not plooked\" and \"\u00acN\" means \"the shank was not nugged\".\n\nIn general, the inference \"P \u2192 N\" does not necessarily imply \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acN\". This is because the original statement only tells us what happens when the shank is plooked, but it doesn't provide information about what happens when the shank is not plooked.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario where the shank can be nugged regardless of whether it's plooked or not. In this case, the original statement \"P \u2192 N\" would still be true, but the inferred statement \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acN\" would be false.\n\nAnswer: no",
