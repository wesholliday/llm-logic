            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can make this inference, let's analyze the original statement: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\" or \"A \u2192 B\". \n\nIn this case, \"A\" is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and \"B\" is \"the dreb was spened\". The statement asserts that if A is true, then B must also be true. \n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened\". This can be represented as \"If not A, then not B\" or \"\u00acA \u2192 \u00acB\". \n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we need to consider the possibilities:\n\n1. If A is true (the dreb was vroombed), then B must be true (the dreb was spened).\n2. If A is false (the dreb was not vroombed), we don't have enough information to conclude anything about B. It's possible that B is true or false.\n\nSince we can't conclude anything about B when A is false, we can't infer \"If not A, then not B\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
