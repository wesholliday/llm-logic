            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can make this inference, let's analyze the original statement: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and Q is \"the fribble crinked.\"\n\nThe inference we're asked to consider is \"If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink.\" This can be represented as \"If not P, then not Q.\" This is a classic example of a logical rule called modus tollens.\n\nModus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, then we can conclude that P must also be false. In this case, we're not given any information about Q being false, but we're asked to infer the converse of the original statement.\n\nWhile modus tollens doesn't directly apply here, we can use a related rule called the law of contrapositive. The law of contrapositive states that \"If P, then Q\" is logically equivalent to \"If not Q, then not P.\" This means that if we have a conditional statement, we can swap the antecedent (P) and consequent (Q) and negate both to get a logically equivalent statement.\n\nIn our case, the law of contrapositive would give us \"If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled.\" This is not exactly what we're asked to infer, but it's close. The inference we're asked to make is the contrapositive of the original statement, but with the order of the clauses reversed.\n\nWhile the law of contrapositive doesn't directly justify the inference, it suggests that the inference might be valid. However, we need to be careful when dealing with conditional statements, as the converse of a statement is not always true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
