This statement implies that the frazzle has two properties: it must be quazzle and it must be gribble quimble quorple. \n\nThe question is asking if we can infer that \"The frazzle must be gribble quimble quorple\". This inference is asking if the frazzle must have only one of the properties mentioned in the original statement, which is \"gribble quimble quorple\". \n\nSince the original statement implies that the frazzle must be both quazzle and gribble quimble quorple, it is reasonable to conclude that the frazzle must be gribble quimble quorple, as it is one of the properties mentioned in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
