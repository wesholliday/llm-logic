This statement is saying that the frazzle must have two properties: it must be gribble crunk and it must be zump grazzle. \n\nIn logic, the \"and\" operator is used to combine two statements, and both statements must be true for the entire statement to be true. Therefore, if the frazzle must be both gribble crunk and zump grazzle, then it must be zump grazzle.\n\nAnswer: yes",
