We can break this down into two parts: \"The crunk must be zibble snizzle\" and \"The crunk must be flimble at snorkel zibble\". The \"and\" connector implies that both parts are true. \n\nSince \"The crunk must be flimble at snorkel zibble\" is one of the parts, we can conclude that it is true. The presence of \"zibble snizzle\" in the original statement does not affect the truth of \"The crunk must be flimble at snorkel zibble\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
