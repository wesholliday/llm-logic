The added clause \"and in the conference room\" introduces new information that is not present in the original statement. \n\nWe cannot logically conclude that the meeting was in the conference room based solely on the information provided in the original statement. The original statement only guarantees the time, but it does not provide any guarantee about the location.\n\nAnswer: no",
