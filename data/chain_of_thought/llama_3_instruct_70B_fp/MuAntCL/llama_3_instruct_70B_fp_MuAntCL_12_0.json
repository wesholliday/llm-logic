It does not provide any information about the budget of the project. \n\nThe added clause \"and been under budget\" introduces new information that is not present in the original statement. Since the original statement does not mention anything about the budget, we cannot infer that the project was under budget simply from the fact that it was completed by Friday.\n\nAnswer: no",
