            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The concert must have been sold out\" only provides information about the concert being sold out, but it does not mention anything about the start time of the concert. The added clause \"and started at 8 PM\" introduces new information that is not present in the original statement. \n\nWe cannot infer the start time of the concert from the original statement, as it is not mentioned. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the concert must have started at 8 PM based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
