            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package must have been delivered yesterday\" only provides information about the delivery of the package, but it does not mention anything about signing for the package. Signing for a package is an additional action that may or may not have occurred during the delivery process. \n\nThe inference \"The package must have been delivered yesterday and signed for\" adds new information that is not present in the original statement. We cannot logically conclude that the package was signed for just because it was delivered yesterday. There might be cases where the package was delivered, but not signed for (e.g., it was left at the doorstep or with a neighbor).\n\nAnswer: no",
