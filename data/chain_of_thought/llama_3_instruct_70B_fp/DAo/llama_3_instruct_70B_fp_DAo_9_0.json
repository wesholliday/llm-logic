            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" - This statement tells us that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n2. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" - This is a conditional statement. It says that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. However, we know from statement 1 that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Therefore, the condition for Mark buying the blue shirt is not met.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n* If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, the conditional statement does not provide any information about Mark buying the blue shirt. It only tells us what would happen if Lisa bought the red shirt, which is not the case.\n* We cannot conclude that Mark did not buy the blue shirt simply because Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Mark's action is independent of Lisa's action in this scenario.\n\nAnswer: no",
