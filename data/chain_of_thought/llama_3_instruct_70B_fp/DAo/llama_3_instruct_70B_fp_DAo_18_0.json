'The doll was not plastic' - This statement tells us that the doll is made of some other material, but not plastic.\n2. 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' - This is a conditional statement. It implies that if the doll were plastic, then the truck would be metal. However, since we know the doll is not plastic (from statement 1), this conditional statement does not provide any direct information about the truck's material.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n* If the doll were plastic, then the truck would be metal (according to the conditional statement).\n* But the doll is not plastic (from statement 1).\n* Therefore, we cannot conclude anything about the truck's material from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
