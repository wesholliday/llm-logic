It implies that if the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside. But we know from statement 1 that the dog is not inside. Therefore, this conditional statement does not provide any information about the cat's location in this scenario.\n\nSince we don't have any direct or indirect information about the cat's location, we cannot infer that \"The cat was not outside\". The cat's location is unknown, and it could be either inside or outside.\n\nAnswer: no",
