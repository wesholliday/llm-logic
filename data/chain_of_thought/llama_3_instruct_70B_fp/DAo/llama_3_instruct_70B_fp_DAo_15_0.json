It means that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. However, since we know that Sam did not take a plane (from statement 1), we cannot conclude anything about Erin taking a train from this statement.\n\nSince we don't have any direct information about Erin taking a train, and the conditional statement doesn't provide any information about Erin taking a train when Sam doesn't take a plane, we cannot infer that Erin did not take a train.\n\nAnswer: no",
