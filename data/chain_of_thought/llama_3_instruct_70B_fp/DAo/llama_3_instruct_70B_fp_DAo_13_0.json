It implies that if the car were red, then the truck would be blue. However, since we know the car is not red (from statement 1), we cannot conclude anything about the truck's color from this statement alone.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The truck was not blue\"? \n\nWe don't have any direct information about the truck's color. The only information we have is a conditional statement that is not applicable in this scenario, since the car is not red. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusion about the truck's color.\n\nAnswer: no",
