'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' - This statement implies that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake. However, it does not provide any information about the mummy's state when the vampire is not awake.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know the vampire is not awake. Statement 2 only talks about the scenario where the vampire is awake, which is not the case here. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about the mummy's state based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
