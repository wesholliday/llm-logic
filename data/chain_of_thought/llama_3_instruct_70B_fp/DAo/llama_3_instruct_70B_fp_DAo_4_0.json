If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know the alien did not visit Mars. Now, let's analyze statement 2. This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\n\nIf P (alien visited Mars), then Q (robot visited Jupiter)\n\nSince we know the alien did not visit Mars (P is false), the conditional statement does not provide any information about Q (robot visited Jupiter). In other words, the truth value of Q is not determined by the given statements.\n\nWe cannot infer that the robot did not visit Jupiter solely based on the given information. There might be other reasons why the robot visited or did not visit Jupiter, but we cannot conclude that it did not visit Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: no",
