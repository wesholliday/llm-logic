Since we know that P is false (Joe did not go to the park), we can conclude that the conditional statement is true, but it doesn't provide any information about Q (Lucy going to the zoo) when P is false.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Can we infer \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\"? We don't have any direct information about Lucy's presence at the zoo. The conditional statement only tells us that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo, but it doesn't provide any information about Lucy's action when Joe didn't go to the park.\n\nAnswer: no",
