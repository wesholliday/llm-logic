'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis' - This is a conditional statement. It means that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. However, since we know Jeff did not play basketball (from statement 1), we cannot conclude anything about Amy playing tennis from this statement alone.\n\nNow, let's try to infer 'Amy did not play tennis'. We can't directly conclude this from the given statements. The first statement only talks about Jeff, and the second statement is a conditional statement that doesn't provide any information about Amy playing tennis when Jeff doesn't play basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
