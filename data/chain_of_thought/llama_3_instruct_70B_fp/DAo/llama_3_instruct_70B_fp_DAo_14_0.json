'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den' - This is a conditional statement. It says that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf must be in the den. However, since we know the bear is not in the cave (from statement 1), we cannot conclude anything about the wolf's location from this statement alone.\n\nNow, let's try to infer 'The wolf was not in the den'. We can't directly conclude this from the given statements. The first statement only talks about the bear, and the second statement is a conditional that doesn't provide any information about the wolf's location when the bear is not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: no",
