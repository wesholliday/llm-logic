            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"The apple was not red\" - This statement tells us that the apple did not have the property of being red.\n2. \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow\". This statement implies that if the apple had been red, then the banana would have been yellow. However, since we know from statement 1 that the apple was not red, we cannot conclude anything about the banana's color from this statement alone.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The banana was not yellow\"? \n\nWe can't make a definitive conclusion about the banana's color based on the given statements. The conditional statement only tells us what would have happened if the apple were red, but it doesn't provide any information about the banana's color in the actual scenario where the apple is not red.\n\nAnswer: no",
