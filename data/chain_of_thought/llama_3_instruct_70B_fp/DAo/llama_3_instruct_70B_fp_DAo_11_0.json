It says that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry. But we know from statement 1 that the cake is not chocolate. So, the condition for the muffins to be blueberry is not met.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n* If the cake is not chocolate, the conditional statement doesn't provide any information about the muffins.\n* We can't conclude that the muffins are blueberry because the condition for that is not met.\n* We also can't conclude that the muffins are not blueberry, because the statements don't provide any direct information about the muffins when the cake is not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
