This statement implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must also be at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince Mary was not at the wedding (statement 1), the condition \"If M\" in the conditional statement is false. In this case, the conditional statement \"If M, then S\" does not provide any information about Sue's presence at the wedding, because the condition is not met.\n\nHowever, we can use a technique called \"modus tollens\" to infer something about Sue's presence. Modus tollens is a logical rule that states: \"If P \u2192 Q and not P, then not Q\". In our case, P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding\". Since we know that Mary was not at the wedding (not P), we can conclude that Sue was not at the wedding (not Q).\n\nAnswer: yes",
