            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"The book was not written by James\" - This statement tells us that James is not the author of the book.\n2. \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel\". This statement implies that if James wrote the book, it would be a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince we know the book was not written by James (statement 1), we can conclude that the condition \"P\" in the conditional statement is false. In this case, the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" does not provide any information about Q (whether the book is a mystery novel or not) because the condition P is not met.\n\nHowever, we can use a technique called \"modus tollens\" to infer something about Q. Modus tollens is a logical rule that states: \"If P \u2192 Q and not P, then not Q\". In our case, we have \"If P, then Q\" (statement 2) and \"not P\" (statement 1). Therefore, we can apply modus tollens to conclude \"not Q\", which means \"the book is not a mystery novel\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
