            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument. The premise is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" (If P, then Q). The conclusion is also a conditional statement: \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\" (If Q, then P).\n\nIn general, the validity of an argument depends on whether the conclusion follows logically from the premise(s). In this case, we need to check if the conclusion can be deduced from the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. However, it does not provide any information about the converse, i.e., whether Sue's presence at the wedding implies Mary's presence. The conclusion assumes that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was also at the wedding, but this is not necessarily true based on the premise alone.\n\nIn fact, it's possible to imagine a scenario where Sue was at the wedding, but Mary was not. For example, Sue might have been a guest, while Mary was not invited. In this scenario, the premise would still be true (If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding), but the conclusion would be false (If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding).\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid, as the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
