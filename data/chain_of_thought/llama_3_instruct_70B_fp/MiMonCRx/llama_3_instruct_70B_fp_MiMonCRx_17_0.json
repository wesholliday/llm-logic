The sentence 'The quibble might be frazzled and gronked' implies that there are two possible states of the quibble: being frazzled and being gronked. The word 'and' is used to connect these two states, indicating that both states are possible simultaneously. \n\nSince 'gronked' is one of the possible states mentioned in the original sentence, we can conclude that the quibble might indeed be gronked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
