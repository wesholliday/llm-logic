This statement implies that there is a possibility that the flibbit has both properties: being wumbled and being quorked. \n\nIf we consider the possibility that the flibbit is both wumbled and quorked, it is also possible that the flibbit is quorked, regardless of whether it is wumbled or not. \n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flibbit might be quorked, because the original statement already implies this possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
