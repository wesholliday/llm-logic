This statement implies that there is a possibility that the zazzle has both properties: being plonked and being frozzed. \n\nIf we consider the possibility that the zazzle is both plonked and frozzed, it necessarily means that the zazzle is frozzed. Therefore, we can infer that the zazzle might be frozzed, because it is one of the possible properties mentioned in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
