This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry\".\n\nTo infer the new statement \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\", we need to check if it follows logically from the original statement. This new statement can be represented as \"If not P, then not Q\".\n\nIn general, the inference \"If not P, then not Q\" is not necessarily true based on the original statement \"If P, then Q\". This is because the original statement only tells us what happens when P is true, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when P is false.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario where the cake is not chocolate, but the muffins are still blueberry. This scenario doesn't contradict the original statement, but it would contradict the inferred statement \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\".\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the new statement \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\" from the original statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\".\n\nAnswer: no",
