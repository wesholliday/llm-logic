            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" can be represented as \"V \u2192 M\", where V represents \"the vampire was awake\" and M represents \"the mummy was awake\". This statement implies that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake. However, it does not provide any information about the situation when the vampire is not awake.\n\nTo infer \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake\", we would need to show that \"\u00acV \u2192 \u00acM\", where \u00acV represents \"the vampire was not awake\" and \u00acM represents \"the mummy was not awake\". However, the original statement does not provide enough information to make this inference.\n\nIn fact, there are possible scenarios where the vampire is not awake, but the mummy is awake. For example, the mummy could be awake independently of the vampire's state. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
