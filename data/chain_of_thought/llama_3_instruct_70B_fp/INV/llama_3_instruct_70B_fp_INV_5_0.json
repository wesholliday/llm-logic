This statement does not provide any information about what happens when Jeff does not play basketball. It only guarantees that if Jeff plays basketball, then Amy plays tennis. \n\nIt does not necessarily mean that if Jeff does not play basketball, then Amy does not play tennis. There could be cases where Jeff does not play basketball, but Amy still plays tennis. \n\nTo infer the converse, we would need more information or a biconditional statement of the form \"If and only if P, then Q\". \n\nAnswer: no",
