This implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if Alex did not finish the race. \n\nIn particular, it does not guarantee that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race. There might be cases where Alex did not finish the race, but Chris still finished the race. \n\nTo infer \"If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race\", we would need additional information or a statement of the form \"If not P, then not Q\", which is not provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
