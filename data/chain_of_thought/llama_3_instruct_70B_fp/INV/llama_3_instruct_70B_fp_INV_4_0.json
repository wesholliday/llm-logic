            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"the alien visited Mars\" and B is \"the robot visited Jupiter\".\n\nTo infer the new statement \"If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter\", we need to check if the negation of A (\u00acA) implies the negation of B (\u00acB). In other words, we need to check if \"\u00acA \u2192 \u00acB\" is true.\n\nUsing the contrapositive rule, we know that \"A \u2192 B\" is equivalent to \"\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA\". This means that if the robot did not visit Jupiter (\u00acB), then the alien did not visit Mars (\u00acA).\n\nNow, we can see that \"\u00acA \u2192 \u00acB\" is actually the contrapositive of the original statement \"A \u2192 B\". Since the contrapositive of a true statement is also true, we can conclude that \"\u00acA \u2192 \u00acB\" is indeed true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
