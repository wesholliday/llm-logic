            "content": "Explanation: Let's analyze the given statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal\".\n\nTo infer the new statement \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal\", we need to check if it is logically equivalent to the original statement. The new statement can be represented as \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\", where \u00acP is \"the doll was not plastic\" and \u00acQ is \"the truck was not metal\".\n\nIn general, \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ is not necessarily equivalent to P \u2192 Q. This is because the original statement only guarantees that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal, but it does not provide any information about what happens when the doll is not plastic.\n\nIn other words, the original statement does not imply that if the doll is not plastic, then the truck must be not metal. There could be cases where the doll is not plastic, but the truck is still metal, or the doll is not plastic, and the truck is not metal.\n\nAnswer: no",
