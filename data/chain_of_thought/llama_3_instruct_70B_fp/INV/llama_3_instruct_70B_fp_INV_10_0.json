This new statement can be represented as \"If not P, then not Q.\" \n\nTo determine if we can make this inference, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n1. The dog is inside (P), and the cat is outside (Q). This satisfies the original statement.\n2. The dog is not inside (not P), and the cat is outside (Q). This does not contradict the original statement, as it only tells us what happens when the dog is inside, not when it's not.\n3. The dog is inside (P), and the cat is not outside (not Q). This contradicts the original statement, so it's not possible.\n4. The dog is not inside (not P), and the cat is not outside (not Q). This does not contradict the original statement, as it only tells us what happens when the dog is inside, not when it's not.\n\nFrom these possibilities, we can see that the original statement does not provide enough information to infer \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.\" There are two possible scenarios when the dog is not inside (not P), and we can't determine which one is true based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
