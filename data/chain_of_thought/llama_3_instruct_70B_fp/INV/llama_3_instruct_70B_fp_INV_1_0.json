            "content": "Explanation: Let's analyze the given statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\". This implies that Mary's presence at the wedding is a sufficient condition for Sue's presence at the wedding. In other words, if Mary is at the wedding, we can be certain that Sue is also at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's consider the proposed inference: \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\". This statement is trying to establish a connection between Mary's absence and Sue's absence. However, the original statement only guarantees Sue's presence when Mary is present, but it does not provide any information about what happens when Mary is absent.\n\nIn particular, the original statement does not rule out the possibility that Sue could be at the wedding even if Mary is not. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
