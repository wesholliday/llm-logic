            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue\". \n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\" from the original statement. This new statement can be represented as \"If not P, then not Q\". \n\nTo determine if we can make this inference, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. The car is red (P is true), and the truck is blue (Q is true). This satisfies the original statement.\n2. The car is not red (P is false), but the truck is blue (Q is true). This does not contradict the original statement, as it only guarantees Q when P is true, not when P is false.\n3. The car is red (P is true), but the truck is not blue (Q is false). This contradicts the original statement, so it's not possible.\n4. The car is not red (P is false), and the truck is not blue (Q is false). This does not contradict the original statement, as it only guarantees Q when P is true, not when P is false.\n\nFrom these scenarios, we can see that the original statement does not provide enough information to conclude that \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\". There are possible scenarios where the car is not red, but the truck is still blue.\n\nAnswer: no",
