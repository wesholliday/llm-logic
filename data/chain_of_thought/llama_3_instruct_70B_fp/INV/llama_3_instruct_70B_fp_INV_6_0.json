            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" can be represented as \"Sue chose pizza \u2192 Bob chose pasta\". This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"Sue chose pizza\" and the consequent is \"Bob chose pasta\". \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta\", we need to examine the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"Sue chose pizza \u2192 Bob chose pasta\" is \"Bob did not choose pasta \u2192 Sue did not choose pizza\". \n\nThe contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true. However, the question asks about the inverse of the original statement, which is \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta\" or \"Sue did not choose pizza \u2192 Bob did not choose pasta\". \n\nThe inverse is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement. In this case, we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement without additional information. \n\nAnswer: no",
