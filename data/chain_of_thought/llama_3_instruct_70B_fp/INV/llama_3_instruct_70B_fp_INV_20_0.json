This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow\". \n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\" from the original statement. This new statement can be represented as \"If not P, then not Q\". \n\nIn general, from a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\", we cannot directly infer \"If not P, then not Q\". This is because the original statement only tells us what happens when P is true, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when P is false. \n\nIn this specific case, the original statement only tells us that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. It doesn't provide any information about the color of the banana when the apple is not red. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the color of the banana when the apple is not red.\n\nAnswer: no",
