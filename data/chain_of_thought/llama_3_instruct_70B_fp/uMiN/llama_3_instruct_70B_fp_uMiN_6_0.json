This means that we cannot be certain that Sue chose pizza. \n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" means that we cannot conclude with absolute certainty that Sue chose pizza. \n\nSince \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" implies that there is uncertainty about Sue's choice, it follows that we cannot be certain that Sue chose pizza. Therefore, we can infer that it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
