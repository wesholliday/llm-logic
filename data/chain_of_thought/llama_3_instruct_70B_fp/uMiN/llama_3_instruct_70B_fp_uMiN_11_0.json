This does not necessarily mean that it is certain that the newspaper is not in the driveway, but rather that it is possible or uncertain.\n\nFrom this statement, we can infer that the opposite statement \"The newspaper must be in the driveway\" is not necessarily true. If the newspaper might not be in the driveway, then it cannot be said with certainty that it must be in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes",
