This is equivalent to saying that it's not certain that James wrote the book. \n\nNow, let's analyze the statement \"it's not the case that the book must have been written by James\". This statement is saying that it's not necessary or certain that James wrote the book. \n\nSince the first statement implies that it's not certain that James wrote the book, and the second statement is saying the same thing, we can infer that the second statement is true if the first statement is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
