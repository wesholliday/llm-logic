This means that we cannot rule out the possibility that the vampire was not awake. \n\nIf we can't rule out the possibility that the vampire was not awake, then we can't conclude that the vampire must have been awake. In other words, the statement \"the vampire must have been awake\" would imply that there's no possibility that the vampire was not awake, which contradicts the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
