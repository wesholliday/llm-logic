This is equivalent to saying that it's not certain that the pen is in the bag. \n\nNow, let's analyze the statement \"it's not the case that the pen must be in my bag\". This statement is saying that it's not necessarily true that the pen has to be in the bag. \n\nSince the first statement implies that there's a possibility the pen is not in the bag, it means that it's not necessarily true that the pen has to be in the bag. Therefore, we can infer that it's not the case that the pen must be in my bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
