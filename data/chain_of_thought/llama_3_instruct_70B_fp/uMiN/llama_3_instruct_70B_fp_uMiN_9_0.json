This means that we cannot be certain that Lisa bought the red shirt. \n\nNow, let's analyze the statement \"it's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\". This statement is saying that it's not true that Lisa definitely bought the red shirt. \n\nSince we already know that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt, it means that we cannot be certain that she bought the red shirt.
