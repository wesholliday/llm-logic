This means that we cannot be certain that the shoes are in the closet. \n\nNow, let's analyze the statement \"it's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet\". This statement is saying that it's not necessary or required that the shoes be in the closet. \n\nGiven the initial statement, we can infer that it's possible the shoes are not in the closet, which means it's not necessary that they be in the closet. Therefore, we can conclude that it's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
