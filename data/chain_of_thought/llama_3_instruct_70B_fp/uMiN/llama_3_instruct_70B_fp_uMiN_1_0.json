This means that we cannot be certain that Mary was at the wedding. \n\nNow, let's analyze the statement \"it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\". This statement is equivalent to saying that we cannot conclude with certainty that Mary was at the wedding. \n\nSince the first statement already implies that we cannot be certain about Mary's presence at the wedding, it logically follows that we cannot infer that Mary must have been at the wedding. \n\nAnswer: yes",
