This means that we cannot be certain that the griffin was in the forest. \n\nNow, let's analyze the statement \"it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\". This statement is saying that we cannot conclude with certainty that the griffin was in the forest. \n\nSince the first statement implies that there is a possibility that the griffin was not in the forest, it means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the griffin was in the forest.
