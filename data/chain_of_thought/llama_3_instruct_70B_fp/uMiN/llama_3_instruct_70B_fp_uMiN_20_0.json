This means that we cannot be certain that the sunglasses are in her bag. \n\nNow, let's analyze the statement \"it's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag\". This statement is saying that it's not true that the sunglasses necessarily have to be in her bag. \n\nGiven the initial statement, we can conclude that it's possible that the sunglasses are not in her bag, which means it's not necessary for them to be in her bag. Therefore, we can infer that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
