This statement does not provide any information that would allow us to favor one option over the other. It simply presents two possibilities without giving any indication of which one is more likely or true.\n\nIn order to infer \"The exam must have been easy\", we would need additional information that suggests the exam was not difficult, but the original statement does not provide that information. The original statement is neutral, presenting two equal possibilities, and we cannot logically conclude that one option is true based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
