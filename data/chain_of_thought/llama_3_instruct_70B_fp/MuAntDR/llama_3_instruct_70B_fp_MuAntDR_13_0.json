This is a disjunctive statement, meaning that only one of the conditions needs to be true for the statement to be true. \n\nFrom this statement, we cannot infer that the movie must have been subtitled, because it's possible that the movie was in English, which would also satisfy the condition. \n\nAnswer: no",
