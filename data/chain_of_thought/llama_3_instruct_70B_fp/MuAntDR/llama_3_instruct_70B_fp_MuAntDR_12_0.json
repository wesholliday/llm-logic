The sentence does not provide any additional information about which of the two alternatives is true. \n\nIn particular, it does not provide any evidence that the project was not completed by Friday. Therefore, we cannot infer that the project must have been extended, because it is possible that the project was completed by Friday.\n\nAnswer: no",
