However, it does not provide any additional information to suggest that one scenario is more likely than the other. \n\nIn order to infer that \"The meeting must have been cancelled\", we would need additional evidence or information that rules out the possibility of the meeting being at 2 PM. Without such evidence, we cannot conclude that the meeting was cancelled.\n\nAnswer: no",
