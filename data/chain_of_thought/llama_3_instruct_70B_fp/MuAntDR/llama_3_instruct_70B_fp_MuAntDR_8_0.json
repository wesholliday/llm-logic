To infer that the restaurant must have been open for limited hours, we would need to eliminate the possibility that it was closed on Monday. However, the original statement does not provide any information that would allow us to rule out the possibility that the restaurant was closed on Monday. Therefore, we cannot infer that the restaurant must have been open for limited hours.\n\nAnswer: no",
