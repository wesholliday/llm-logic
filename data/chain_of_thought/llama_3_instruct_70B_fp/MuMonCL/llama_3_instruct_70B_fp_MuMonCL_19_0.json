            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a compound statement that consists of two clauses: \"The application must have been completed online\" and \"included references\". The word \"and\" is used to connect these two clauses, indicating that both conditions must be true. \n\nTo infer \"The application must have been completed online\", we need to determine if this clause is a necessary condition for the original statement to be true. Since the original statement requires both clauses to be true, it means that \"The application must have been completed online\" is a necessary condition. \n\nIn other words, if the application was not completed online, the original statement would be false, regardless of whether references were included or not. Therefore, we can infer that \"The application must have been completed online\" is a necessary condition for the original statement to be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
