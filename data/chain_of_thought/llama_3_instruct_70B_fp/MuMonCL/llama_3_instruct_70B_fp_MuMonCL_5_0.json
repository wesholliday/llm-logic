            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for\" implies that two events have occurred: the package was delivered today, and it was signed for. The inference we are trying to make is \"The package must have been delivered today\", which is a subset of the original statement. In other words, if the package was delivered today and signed for, it necessarily means that the package was delivered today. The additional information about it being signed for does not affect the fact that it was delivered today.\n\nAnswer: yes",
