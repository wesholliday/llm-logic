            "content": "Explanation: The original statement says \"The contract must have been valid for a year and renewable\". This implies that there are two conditions that must be met: the contract must have been valid for a year, and it must be renewable. If both conditions must be met, then it is necessary that the contract must have been valid for a year. The fact that it is also renewable does not change the fact that it must have been valid for a year.\n\nAnswer: yes",
