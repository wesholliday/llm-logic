            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The document must have been signed and notarized\" implies that both signing and notarizing are necessary conditions for the document. In other words, it's not enough for the document to be only signed or only notarized; it must meet both conditions. \n\nFrom this, we can logically conclude that if the document must be both signed and notarized, then it must at least be signed. The notarization is an additional requirement, but signing is a necessary part of the process.\n\nAnswer: yes",
