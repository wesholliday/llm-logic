This statement is a conjunction of two clauses: \"The book must have been on the shelf\" and \"have had a red cover\". \n\nIn logic, when we have a conjunction of two clauses, we can infer that each individual clause must be true. This is because the conjunction \"and\" implies that both clauses must be satisfied simultaneously. \n\nTherefore, if the original statement is true, then both clauses must be true, including \"The book must have been on the shelf\". \n\nAnswer: yes",
