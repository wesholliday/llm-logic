            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a compound statement that contains two clauses: \"The concert must have been sold out\" and \"started at 8 PM\". These two clauses are connected with \"and\", which is a logical conjunction. In logic, when two statements are connected with \"and\", we can infer that each individual statement is true if the compound statement is true. In other words, if the entire statement \"The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM\" is true, then both \"The concert must have been sold out\" and \"started at 8 PM\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
