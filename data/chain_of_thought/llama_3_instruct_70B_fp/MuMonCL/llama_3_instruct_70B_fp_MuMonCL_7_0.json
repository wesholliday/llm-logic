The conjunction \"and\" is used to connect these two clauses, indicating that both clauses are true. \n\nTo infer \"The exam must have been difficult\", we need to determine if this clause can be logically deduced from the original statement. Since the original statement asserts that both clauses are true, we can conclude that \"The exam must have been difficult\" is indeed true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
