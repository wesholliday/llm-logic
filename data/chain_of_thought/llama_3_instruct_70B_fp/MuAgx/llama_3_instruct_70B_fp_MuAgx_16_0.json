We are asked to infer \"The flibbit must be quibble crunk and snork zooble wozzle\". \n\nThe main difference between the two statements is the presence of \"it must\" in the original statement and its absence in the inferred statement. However, in the context of the sentence, \"it\" refers to \"The flibbit\". Therefore, \"it must\" can be replaced with \"The flibbit must\" without changing the meaning of the sentence. \n\nThis means that the inferred statement is essentially a rephrased version of the original statement, with the same meaning and grammatical structure. \n\nAnswer: yes",
