This statement is saying that two conditions must be met: the glorp must be wobble, and it (the glorp) must be zooble. \n\nThe question is asking if we can infer \"The glorp must be wobble and zooble\" from the original statement. This inferred statement is combining the two conditions into a single statement, saying that the glorp must be both wobble and zooble.\n\nSince the original statement is saying that both conditions must be met, it is logically equivalent to saying that the glorp must be both wobble and zooble. \n\nAnswer: yes",
