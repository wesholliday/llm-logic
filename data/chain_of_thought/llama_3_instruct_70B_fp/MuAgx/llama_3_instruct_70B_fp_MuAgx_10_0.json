            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is \"The plonk must be wibble and it must be wibble\". This statement is saying that two conditions must be true: the plonk must be wibble, and it (referring to the plonk) must be wibble. Since \"it\" refers to the plonk, we can replace \"it\" with \"the plonk\" to get \"The plonk must be wibble and the plonk must be wibble\". \n\nNow, we can see that the two conditions are identical, both stating that the plonk must be wibble. Therefore, we can simplify the statement to \"The plonk must be wibble and wibble\", which is equivalent to saying \"The plonk must be wibble\" since the two conditions are redundant.\n\nAnswer: yes",
