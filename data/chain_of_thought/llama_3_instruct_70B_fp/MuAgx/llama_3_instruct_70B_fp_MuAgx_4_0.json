            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence is \"The quorple must be at snork gribble and it must be in the wibble plonk\". We can break this down into two separate clauses: \"The quorple must be at snork gribble\" and \"it must be in the wibble plonk\". The pronoun \"it\" in the second clause refers back to \"The quorple\" in the first clause. \n\nThe proposed inference is \"The quorple must be at snork gribble and in the wibble plonk\". This sentence combines the two clauses into one, using a conjunction \"and\" to connect the two phrases \"at snork gribble\" and \"in the wibble plonk\". \n\nSince the original sentence implies that the quorple must satisfy both conditions (being at snork gribble and being in the wibble plonk), and the proposed inference simply combines these conditions into a single sentence, the inference is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
