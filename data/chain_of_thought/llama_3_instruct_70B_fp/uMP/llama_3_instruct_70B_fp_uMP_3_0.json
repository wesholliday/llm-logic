We are told that \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the book was written by James\" and B is \"the book is a mystery novel\". \n\nNext, we are told that \"the book was written by James\", which means that the condition A is true. \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that the book is a mystery novel. Since the condition A is true, and we know that \"If A, then B\", we can conclude that B must also be true. Therefore, we can infer that the book is a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: yes",
