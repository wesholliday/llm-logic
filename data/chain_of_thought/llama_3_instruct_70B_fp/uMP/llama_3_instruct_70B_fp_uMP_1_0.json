We are told that \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\" or \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and B is \"Sue was at the wedding\". \n\nWe are also told that \"Mary was at the wedding\", which means the condition A is true. \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that Sue was at the wedding. Since the condition A is true, and we know that \"If A, then B\", we can conclude that B must also be true. Therefore, we can infer that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
