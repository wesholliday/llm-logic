            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given information step by step. We are given two statements: \n\n1. If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\" or \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"Tom watched football\" and B is \"Jen watched basketball\". \n\n2. Tom watched football. This is a simple statement that tells us the condition \"A\" is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that Jen watched basketball. Since the condition \"A\" (Tom watched football) is true, and we have a conditional statement \"A \u2192 B\", we can conclude that the consequence \"B\" (Jen watched basketball) must also be true. This is a classic example of modus ponens, a valid argument form in logic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
