This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q is \"Kate ate salad\". \n\n2. Ben ate pasta. This statement confirms that the condition \"P\" is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that Kate ate salad. Since the condition \"P\" is true, and we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\", we can conclude that Q must also be true. Therefore, we can infer that Kate ate salad.\n\nAnswer: yes",
