The apple was red.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the apple was indeed red. Now, let's look at statement 1. It says that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. Since we know the apple is red (from statement 2), we can conclude that the condition in statement 1 is true. Therefore, we can infer the consequence of statement 1, which is that the banana was yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
