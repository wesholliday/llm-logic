The cake was chocolate.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. This is a conditional statement, where the condition is \"the cake is chocolate\" and the consequence is \"the muffins are blueberry\".\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the condition \"the cake is chocolate\" is true. \n\nNow, we can apply the conditional statement from 1 to the fact from 2. Since the cake is indeed chocolate, we can conclude that the muffins must be blueberry.\n\nAnswer: yes",
