The shirt was cotton.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. This is a conditional statement, where the condition is \"the shirt is cotton\" and the consequence is \"the pants are denim\".\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the shirt is indeed cotton. \n\nNow, we can combine these two statements. Since the shirt is cotton (from statement 2), we can apply the conditional statement from statement 1. This means that the condition \"the shirt is cotton\" is true, so we can infer the consequence \"the pants are denim\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
