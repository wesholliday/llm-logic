The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This implies that if the dog is inside, we can conclude that the cat is outside. The second statement is a simple assertion: \"The dog was inside.\" \n\nNow, we can use these two statements to make an inference. Since the dog was inside (from the second statement), we can apply the conditional statement. If the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside. Therefore, we can conclude that the cat was outside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
