We are told that \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and B is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\". \n\nWe are also told that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\", which means that the condition A is true. \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that Mark bought the blue shirt (B). Since the condition A is true, and the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is given, we can conclude that B must also be true. \n\nAnswer: yes",
