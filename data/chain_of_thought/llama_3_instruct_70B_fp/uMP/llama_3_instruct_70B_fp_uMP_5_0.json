            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given information step by step. We are given two statements: \n\n1. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\" or \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"Jeff played basketball\" and B is \"Amy played tennis\". \n\n2. Jeff played basketball. This is a simple statement that tells us the condition \"A\" is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that Amy played tennis. Since the condition \"A\" (Jeff played basketball) is true, and we have a conditional statement \"A \u2192 B\", we can conclude that the consequence \"B\" (Amy played tennis) must also be true. This is a classic example of modus ponens, a valid argument form in logic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
