If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\nThis is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the alien visited Mars\" and B is \"the robot visited Jupiter\".\n\n2. The alien visited Mars.\nThis statement tells us that the condition \"A\" in the first statement is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that the robot visited Jupiter. Since the condition \"A\" is true, and the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is given, we can conclude that B must also be true. In this case, B is \"the robot visited Jupiter\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
