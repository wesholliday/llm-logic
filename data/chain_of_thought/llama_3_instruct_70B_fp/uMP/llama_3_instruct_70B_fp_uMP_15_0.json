We are told that \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin took a train\". \n\nWe are also told that \"Sam took a plane\", which means the condition P is true. \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that Erin took a train (Q). Since the condition P is true, and we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\", we can conclude that Q must also be true. \n\nAnswer: yes",
