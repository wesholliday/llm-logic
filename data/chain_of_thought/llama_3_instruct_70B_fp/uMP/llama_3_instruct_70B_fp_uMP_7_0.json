We are told that \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"A \u2192 C\", where A is \"Alex finished the race\" and C is \"Chris finished the race\". \n\nWe are also told that \"Alex finished the race\", which means A is true. \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that Chris finished the race (C is true). Since A is true, and we know that A \u2192 C, we can conclude that C must also be true. This is a classic example of modus ponens, a valid inference rule in logic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
