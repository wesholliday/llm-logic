            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be represented as \"If P, then M\", where P represents \"the doll was plastic\" and M represents \"the truck was metal\". The second statement is a simple assertion: \"the doll was plastic\", which is equivalent to saying P is true.\n\nNow, we can use modus ponens, a rule of inference, to draw a conclusion. Modus ponens states that if we have \"If P, then M\" and P, we can infer M. In this case, we have \"If P, then M\" (the first statement) and P (the second statement), so we can infer M, which means the truck was metal.\n\nAnswer: yes",
