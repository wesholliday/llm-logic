We are told that \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"Joe went to the park\" and B is \"Lucy went to the zoo\". \n\nNext, we are told that \"Joe went to the park\", which means that the condition A is true. \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that Lucy went to the zoo. Since the condition A is true, and the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is given, we can conclude that B must also be true. Therefore, we can infer that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: yes",
