If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\nThis is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition \"the griffin was in the forest\" is true, then the conclusion \"the unicorn was in the forest\" must also be true.\n\n2. The griffin was in the forest.\nThis statement tells us that the condition mentioned in statement 1 is indeed true.\n\nNow, we can apply the conditional statement to this new information. Since the griffin was in the forest, we can infer that the unicorn was also in the forest, according to the conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
