The hurt is likely due to the loud noise of the scream. \n\nIf we add the condition \"I am wearing earplugs\" to the original statement, it would likely reduce or eliminate the hurt caused to the speaker's ears. Earplugs are designed to block or reduce loud noises, so it's reasonable to assume that they would protect the speaker's ears from the hurt caused by the scream.\n\nAnswer: no",
