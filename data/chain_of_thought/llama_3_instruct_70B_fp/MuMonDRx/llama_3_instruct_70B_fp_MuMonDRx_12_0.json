This statement asserts that the fizzle has a certain property, namely being zizz by zooble. \n\nWhen we consider the proposed inference, \"The fizzle must be froodle or zizz by zooble\", we can break it down into two possibilities: the fizzle is froodle by zooble, or the fizzle is zizz by zooble. \n\nSince the original statement already asserts that the fizzle is zizz by zooble, it is certainly possible that the fizzle is froodle or zizz by zooble, as one of the disjuncts (zizz by zooble) is already known to be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
