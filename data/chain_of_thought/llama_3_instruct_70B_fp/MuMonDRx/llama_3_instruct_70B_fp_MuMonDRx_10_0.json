This statement asserts that being wumble is a necessary condition for something to be a grazzle.\n\nThe proposed inference is 'The grazzle must be frazzle or wumble'. This statement asserts that being either frazzle or wumble is a necessary condition for something to be a grazzle.\n\nSince the original statement only mentions wumble, we cannot logically conclude that being frazzle is also a necessary condition for something to be a grazzle. The presence of 'or frazzle' in the proposed inference is not justified by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
