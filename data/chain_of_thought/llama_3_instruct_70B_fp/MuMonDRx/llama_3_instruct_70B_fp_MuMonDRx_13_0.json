This implies that the quimble's location is restricted to glorp, and it cannot be anywhere else.\n\nThe proposed inference is \"The quimble must be zibble or in glorp\". This statement introduces a new possibility, \"zibble\", in addition to \"in glorp\". \n\nIf the original statement is true, it means the quimble is definitely in glorp. The proposed inference adds an alternative possibility, \"zibble\", but it does not contradict the original statement. In fact, the original statement is a subset of the proposed inference, as \"in glorp\" is one of the options in the proposed inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
