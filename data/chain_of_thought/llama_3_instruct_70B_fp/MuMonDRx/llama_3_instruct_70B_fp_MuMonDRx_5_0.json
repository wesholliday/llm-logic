This statement asserts that the snorkel has a certain property, namely being \"glorp zizz\".\n\nThe proposed inference is \"The snorkel must be quorple or glorp zizz\". This statement is saying that the snorkel must have either the property \"quorple\" or the property \"glorp zizz\".\n\nSince the original statement already asserts that the snorkel is \"glorp zizz\", it is certainly true that the snorkel is either \"quorple\" or \"glorp zizz\" (because we know it's \"glorp zizz\"). The addition of \"quorple\" as an alternative option does not contradict the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
