This statement asserts that the flim has a certain property, namely being wumble a plonk.\n\nThe proposed inference is \"The flim must be crunk or wumble a plonk\". This statement is saying that the flim must have either the property of being crunk or the property of being wumble a plonk.\n\nSince the original statement already asserts that the flim is wumble a plonk, it is a subset of the possibilities presented in the proposed inference. In other words, if the flim must be wumble a plonk, then it is certainly true that it must be either crunk or wumble a plonk.\n\nAnswer: yes",
