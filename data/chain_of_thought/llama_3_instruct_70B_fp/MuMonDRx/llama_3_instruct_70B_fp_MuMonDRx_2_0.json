However, the original statement does not provide any information about the quimble. It only talks about the quazzle.\n\nSince the original statement does not mention the quimble, we cannot infer that the grooble must be in the quimble or on the quazzle. The original statement only restricts the grooble's location to the quazzle, without providing any information about other possible locations.\n\nAnswer: no",
