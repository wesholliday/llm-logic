This implies that the only possibility for the wibble is to be zizz.\n\nThe proposed inference is 'The wibble must be wobble or zizz'. This statement is saying that the wibble can be either wobble or zizz.\n\nComparing the two statements, we can see that the original statement is more restrictive, only allowing the wibble to be zizz. The proposed inference is more permissive, allowing the wibble to be either wobble or zizz.\n\nSince the original statement does not provide any information about the wibble being wobble, we cannot infer that the wibble can be wobble. However, the original statement does imply that the wibble can be zizz, which is consistent with the proposed inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
