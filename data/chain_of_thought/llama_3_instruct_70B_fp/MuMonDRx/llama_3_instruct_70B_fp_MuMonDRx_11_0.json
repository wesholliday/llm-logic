This implies that being quazzle is a necessary condition for something to be a frozz.\n\nThe proposed inference is 'The frozz must be flibbit or quazzle'. This statement is saying that being either flibbit or quazzle is a necessary condition for something to be a frozz.\n\nSince the original statement only mentions quazzle as a necessary condition, we cannot conclude that being flibbit is also a necessary condition. However, we can say that being quazzle is a sufficient condition to satisfy the necessary condition (i.e., being a frozz). Therefore, we can infer that being flibbit or quazzle is also a sufficient condition, as it includes the original sufficient condition (quazzle).\n\nAnswer: yes",
