            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The document must have been signed or notarized\" implies that there are two possible options for the document to be valid: it must have been signed, or it must have been notarized, or possibly both. This is a classic example of a logical OR operation. \n\nIn the inferred statement \"The document must have been signed or it must have been notarized\", we are also presented with a logical OR operation. The phrase \"it must have been\" is used to emphasize the necessity of one of the two options. \n\nSince the original statement and the inferred statement convey the same meaning, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
