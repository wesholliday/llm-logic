It could be a salad, it could be soup, or it could be both. \n\nThe inferred statement \"The meal must have included a salad or it must have included soup\" is trying to break down the original statement into two separate possibilities. This is a valid inference because the original statement already implies that one of the two options must be true. \n\nThe inferred statement is simply making it explicit that either the meal had a salad or it had soup (or possibly both, but that's not the focus here). \n\nAnswer: yes",
