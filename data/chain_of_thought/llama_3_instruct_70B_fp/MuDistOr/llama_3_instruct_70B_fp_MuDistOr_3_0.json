It only guarantees that at least one of the options is true. \n\nFor example, the book could have been on the shelf, but it's not necessarily true that it must have been in the backpack. Similarly, the book could have been in the backpack, but it's not necessarily true that it must have been on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: no",
