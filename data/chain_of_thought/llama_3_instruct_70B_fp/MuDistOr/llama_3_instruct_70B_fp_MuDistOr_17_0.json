The phrase \"or\" is used to indicate that either option is possible.\n\nTo infer \"The experiment must have been conducted in a lab or it must have been conducted in the field\", we need to examine the logical structure of the original statement. The original statement can be broken down into two possible scenarios: the experiment was conducted in a lab, or the experiment was conducted in the field. The \"or\" in the original statement implies that these two scenarios are mutually exclusive, meaning that if one is true, the other must be false.\n\nThe inferred statement \"The experiment must have been conducted in a lab or it must have been conducted in the field\" is simply a rephrased version of the original statement, using \"it must have been\" instead of \"in\". This rephrased statement still conveys the same meaning as the original statement, which is that the experiment was conducted in one of the two locations.\n\nAnswer: yes",
