            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The contract must have been approved by the legal team or the CEO\" implies that there are two possible scenarios: either the legal team approved the contract or the CEO approved the contract. This is a disjunction, where \"or\" is used to connect two clauses. \n\nIn the proposed inference, \"The contract must have been approved by the legal team or it must have been approved by the CEO\", the phrase \"it must have been approved\" is used to refer back to \"the contract\". This rephrased sentence still conveys the same meaning as the original statement, which is that the contract's approval can be attributed to either the legal team or the CEO.\n\nAnswer: yes",
