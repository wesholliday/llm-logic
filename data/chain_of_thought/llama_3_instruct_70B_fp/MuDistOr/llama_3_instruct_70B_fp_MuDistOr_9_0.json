            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package must have been delivered by truck or by plane\" implies that there are only two possible ways the package could have been delivered: by truck or by plane. This is a disjunction, where one or both of the options must be true.\n\nThe inferred statement \"The package must have been delivered by truck or it must have been delivered by plane\" is a rephrased version of the original statement. It still conveys the same meaning, which is that the package was delivered by one of the two methods.\n\nThe key point is that the original statement and the inferred statement are logically equivalent. They both express the same idea, which is that the package was delivered by either truck or plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
