We know that \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is true, which means that if Alex finished the race, it necessarily implies that Chris finished the race. We also know that \"Chris finished the race\" is true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. If Chris finished the race, it doesn't necessarily mean that Alex finished the race. There could be other reasons why Chris finished the race, unrelated to Alex's participation. The original statement only guarantees that if Alex finished, then Chris finished, but it doesn't provide any information about the converse (i.e., if Chris finished, then Alex finished).\n\nAnswer: no",
