We know that \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is true, which means that if the condition \"Tom watched football\" is true, then the consequence \"Jen watched basketball\" must also be true. We also know that \"Jen watched basketball\" is true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. If \"Jen watched basketball\" is true, it could be because \"Tom watched football\" is true, which would satisfy the conditional statement. However, it's also possible that \"Jen watched basketball\" is true for some other reason, unrelated to Tom watching football. The conditional statement only guarantees that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball, but it doesn't exclude other possibilities for Jen watching basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
