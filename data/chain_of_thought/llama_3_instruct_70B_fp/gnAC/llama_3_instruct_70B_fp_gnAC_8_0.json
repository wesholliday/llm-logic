We know that \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is true, which means that if the vampire was awake, it necessarily implies that the mummy was awake. We also know that \"The mummy was awake\" is true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. If the mummy was awake, it doesn't necessarily mean that the vampire was awake. The first statement only guarantees that if the vampire was awake, the mummy would be awake, but it doesn't provide any information about the vampire's state when the mummy is awake.\n\nIn other words, there could be scenarios where the mummy is awake, but the vampire is not. For example, maybe the mummy was awakened by some external factor, and the vampire is still asleep.\n\nAnswer: no",
