            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We know that \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is true, which means that if Mary was present, then Sue must have been present too. This implies a conditional relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence. We also know that \"Sue was at the wedding\" is true, which means Sue was indeed present at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's examine whether it necessarily follows that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true. If Sue was at the wedding, it doesn't necessarily mean that Mary was also at the wedding. There could be other reasons why Sue was at the wedding, unrelated to Mary's presence. The conditional statement only guarantees that if Mary was present, then Sue would be present, but it doesn't provide any information about Mary's presence when Sue is present.\n\nAnswer: no",
