This statement only guarantees that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry, but it does not provide any information about the converse, i.e., what happens if the muffins are blueberry.\n\nIn particular, the original statement does not rule out the possibility that the muffins could be blueberry even if the cake is not chocolate. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the muffins are blueberry, then the cake must be chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
