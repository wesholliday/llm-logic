            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" can be represented as \"Mary \u2192 Sue\". This implies that if Mary was present, then Sue was also present. However, it does not provide any information about the converse situation, i.e., if Sue was present, does it necessarily mean Mary was present?\n\nTo infer \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\" would require us to assume that the presence of Sue guarantees the presence of Mary, which is not explicitly stated in the original statement. In fact, it's possible that Sue could have been at the wedding without Mary being present.\n\nAnswer: no",
