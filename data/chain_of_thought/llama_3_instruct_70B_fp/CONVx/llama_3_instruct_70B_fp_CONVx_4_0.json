This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and the consequent is \"the fribble crinked\". \n\nTo infer the converse, \"If the fribble crinked, then the fribble was snurgled\", we would need to swap the antecedent and consequent. However, this is not necessarily true. \n\nJust because we know that if the fribble was snurgled, it crinked, it does not mean that if it crinked, it was snurgled. There could be other reasons why the fribble crinked. \n\nFor example, consider a scenario where the fribble can crink due to multiple reasons, such as being snurgled or being flumplenooked. In this case, just because the fribble crinked, we cannot conclude that it was snurgled. It could have been flumplenooked instead.\n\nAnswer: no",
