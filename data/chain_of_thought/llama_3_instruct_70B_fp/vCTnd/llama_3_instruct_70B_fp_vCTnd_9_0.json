            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument. The premise is \"If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly\" which can be represented as \"P \u2192 \u00acQ\", where P is \"instructions were given\" and Q is \"instructions were explained clearly\".\n\nThe conclusion is \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given\" which can be represented as \"Q \u2192 \u00acP\". \n\nNow, we can see that the premise and conclusion are contrapositives of each other. The contrapositive of \"P \u2192 \u00acQ\" is indeed \"Q \u2192 \u00acP\". In propositional logic, an argument is valid if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. Since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, it follows logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
