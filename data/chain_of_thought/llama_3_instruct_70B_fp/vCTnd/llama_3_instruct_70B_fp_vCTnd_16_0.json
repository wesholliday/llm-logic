            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise is \"If the job was completed, then it was not completed well\" (C \u2192 \u00acW), where C represents \"the job was completed\" and W represents \"the job was completed well\".\n\nThe conclusion is \"If the job was completed well, then it was not completed\" (W \u2192 \u00acC).\n\nTo see if the conclusion follows from the premise, we can try to derive the conclusion from the premise using logical rules.\n\nOne possible approach is to use the contrapositive rule, which states that if we have a statement of the form \"A \u2192 B\", we can infer \"\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA\".\n\nApplying this rule to the premise, we get \"\u00ac(\u00acW) \u2192 \u00acC\", which simplifies to \"W \u2192 \u00acC\". This is exactly the conclusion we are trying to derive.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because we can derive the conclusion from the premise using a valid logical rule.\n\nAnswer: yes",
