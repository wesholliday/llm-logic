            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise is \"If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly\", which can be represented as \"T \u2192 \u00acTh\" (where T means \"the room was tidied\" and Th means \"the room was tidied thoroughly\").\n\nThe conclusion is \"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied\", which can be represented as \"Th \u2192 \u00acT\".\n\nTo see if the conclusion follows from the premise, we can try to derive the conclusion from the premise using logical rules. One possible way to do this is to use the rule of contraposition, which states that \"A \u2192 B\" is equivalent to \"\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA\".\n\nApplying contraposition to the premise \"T \u2192 \u00acTh\", we get \"\u00ac\u00acTh \u2192 \u00acT\", which simplifies to \"Th \u2192 \u00acT\". This is exactly the conclusion we were trying to derive.\n\nSince we were able to derive the conclusion from the premise using a valid logical rule, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
