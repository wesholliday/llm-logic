            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the premise and conclusion. The premise states \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice\", which can be rewritten as \"Advice was offered \u2192 Not helpful advice\". The conclusion states \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered\", which can be rewritten as \"Helpful advice was offered \u2192 Advice was not offered\".\n\nTo check for validity, we can try to find a counterexample. Suppose advice was offered and it was helpful. In this case, the premise \"Advice was offered \u2192 Not helpful advice\" would be false, but the conclusion \"Helpful advice was offered \u2192 Advice was not offered\" would also be false. This is a problem, because a valid argument should have a true conclusion whenever the premise is true.\n\nHowever, we can also try to rewrite the conclusion in a more intuitive way. \"Helpful advice was offered \u2192 Advice was not offered\" is equivalent to \"Advice was offered \u2192 Not helpful advice\", which is the same as the premise. This suggests that the argument is actually valid, because the conclusion is just a restatement of the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
