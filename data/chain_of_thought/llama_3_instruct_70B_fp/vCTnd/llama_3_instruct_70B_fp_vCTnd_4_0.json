            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise is \"If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently\", which can be represented as \"S \u2192 \u00acD\" (where S represents \"Ben studied\" and D represents \"Ben studied diligently\").\n\nThe conclusion is \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study\", which can be represented as \"D \u2192 \u00acS\".\n\nTo see if the conclusion follows from the premise, we can try to derive the conclusion from the premise using logical rules. One possible approach is to use the rule of contraposition, which states that \"P \u2192 Q\" is equivalent to \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\".\n\nApplying contraposition to the premise \"S \u2192 \u00acD\", we get \"D \u2192 \u00acS\", which is exactly the conclusion. This suggests that the argument is logically valid.\n\nHowever, we need to be careful and consider all possible scenarios. Suppose Ben did not study at all. In this case, the premise \"S \u2192 \u00acD\" is vacuously true, but the conclusion \"D \u2192 \u00acS\" is false. This means that the argument is not logically valid, as the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
