            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise is \"If it's raining, then it's not raining hard\" which can be represented as \"R \u2192 \u00acRH\" (where R represents \"it's raining\" and RH represents \"it's raining hard\").\n\nThe conclusion is \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining\" which can be represented as \"RH \u2192 \u00acR\".\n\nTo see if the conclusion follows from the premise, we can try to derive the conclusion from the premise using logical rules. One possible approach is to use the rule of contraposition, which states that if \"A \u2192 B\" is true, then \"\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA\" is also true.\n\nApplying contraposition to the premise \"R \u2192 \u00acRH\", we get \"RH \u2192 \u00acR\", which is the conclusion. This suggests that the argument is logically valid, because we can derive the conclusion from the premise using a valid logical rule.\n\nAnswer: yes",
