            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise is \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly\", which can be represented as \"C \u2192 \u00acT\" (where C represents \"the room was cleaned\" and T represents \"the room was cleaned thoroughly\").\n\nThe conclusion is \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\", which can be represented as \"T \u2192 \u00acC\".\n\nTo see if the conclusion follows from the premise, we can try to derive the conclusion from the premise using logical rules. One possible approach is to use the rule of contraposition, which states that \"A \u2192 B\" is equivalent to \"\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA\".\n\nApplying contraposition to the premise \"C \u2192 \u00acT\", we get \"T \u2192 \u00acC\", which is exactly the conclusion. This suggests that the argument is logically valid, because we can derive the conclusion from the premise using a valid logical rule.\n\nAnswer: yes",
