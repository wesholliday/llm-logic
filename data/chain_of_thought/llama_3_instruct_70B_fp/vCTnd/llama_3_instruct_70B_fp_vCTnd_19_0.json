            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise is \"If directions were provided, then they were not explained clearly\", which can be represented as \"P \u2192 \u00acQ\", where P is \"directions were provided\" and Q is \"directions were explained clearly\".\n\nThe conclusion is \"If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided\", which can be represented as \"Q \u2192 \u00acP\".\n\nNow, let's see if we can derive the conclusion from the premise. If we assume the premise is true, we know that if P is true, then \u00acQ must be true. But this implies that if Q is true, then P must be false, which is exactly what the conclusion states.\n\nIn other words, the premise and conclusion are contrapositives of each other, which means that they are logically equivalent. This means that if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nAnswer: yes",
