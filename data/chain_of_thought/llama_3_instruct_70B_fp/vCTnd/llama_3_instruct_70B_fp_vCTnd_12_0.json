            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise is \"If Jane studied, then she did not study long\", which can be represented as \"S \u2192 \u00acSL\" (where S means \"Jane studied\" and SL means \"Jane studied long\").\n\nThe conclusion is \"If Jane studied long, then she did not study\", which can be represented as \"SL \u2192 \u00acS\".\n\nTo see if the conclusion follows from the premise, we can try to derive the conclusion from the premise using logical rules. One possible approach is to use the rule of contraposition, which states that \"A \u2192 B\" is equivalent to \"\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA\".\n\nApplying contraposition to the premise \"S \u2192 \u00acSL\", we get \"\u00ac\u00acSL \u2192 \u00acS\", which is equivalent to \"SL \u2192 \u00acS\". This is exactly the conclusion we are trying to derive.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise using a valid logical rule.\n\nAnswer: yes",
