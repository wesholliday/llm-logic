            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise is \"If a recommendation was made, then it was not a strong recommendation\", which can be symbolized as \"R \u2192 \u00acSR\" (where R represents \"a recommendation was made\" and SR represents \"a strong recommendation was made\").\n\nThe conclusion is \"If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made\", which can be symbolized as \"SR \u2192 \u00acR\".\n\nTo see if the conclusion follows from the premise, we can try to derive the conclusion from the premise using logical rules. One way to do this is to use the rule of contraposition, which states that if \"A \u2192 B\" is true, then \"\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA\" is also true.\n\nApplying contraposition to the premise \"R \u2192 \u00acSR\", we get \"\u00ac\u00acSR \u2192 \u00acR\", which is equivalent to \"SR \u2192 \u00acR\". This is exactly the conclusion we were trying to derive.\n\nAnswer: yes",
