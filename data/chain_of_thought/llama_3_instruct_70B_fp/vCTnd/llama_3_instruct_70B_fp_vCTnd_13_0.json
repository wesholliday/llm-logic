            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise is \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much.\" This can be represented symbolically as:\n\nE \u2192 \u00acM\n\nWhere E represents \"Alex exercised\" and M represents \"Alex exercised much.\"\n\nThe conclusion is \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise.\" This can be represented symbolically as:\n\nM \u2192 \u00acE\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion (M \u2192 \u00acE) follows logically from the premise (E \u2192 \u00acM).\n\nOne way to approach this is to consider the contrapositive of the premise, which is \u00acM \u2192 \u00acE. This is logically equivalent to the original premise.\n\nNow, we can see that the conclusion (M \u2192 \u00acE) is the contrapositive of the contrapositive of the premise (\u00acM \u2192 \u00acE). This means that the conclusion is actually equivalent to the premise, but with the variables swapped.\n\nThis suggests that the argument is not logically valid, because the conclusion is not necessarily true even if the premise is true. The premise only tells us that if Alex exercised, then he didn't exercise much, but it doesn't provide enough information to conclude that if Alex exercised much, then he didn't exercise.\n\nAnswer: no",
