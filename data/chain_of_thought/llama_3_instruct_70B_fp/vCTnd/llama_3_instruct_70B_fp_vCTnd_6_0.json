            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise is \"If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly\" (P \u2192 \u00acQ).\n\nThe conclusion is \"If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed\" (Q \u2192 \u00acP).\n\nWe can see that the premise and conclusion have a similar structure, but with the antecedent and consequent swapped. This is a classic sign of a logically valid argument, known as the \"contrapositive\" form.\n\nIn general, if we have a statement \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), the contrapositive is \"If not Q, then not P\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP). In this case, we can apply the contrapositive to the premise to get the conclusion.\n\nSo, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
