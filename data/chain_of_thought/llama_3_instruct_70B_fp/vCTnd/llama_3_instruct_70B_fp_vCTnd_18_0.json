The contrapositive of a statement \"if p, then q\" is \"if not q, then not p\". In this case, the premise is \"if p, then not q\", and the conclusion is \"if q, then not p\", which is the contrapositive of the premise.\n\nSince the contrapositive of a true statement is always true, and the premise is given as true, we can conclude that the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
