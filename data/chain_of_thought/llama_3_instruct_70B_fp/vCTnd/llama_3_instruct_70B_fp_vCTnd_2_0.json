            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nThe premise is \"If Ann exercised, then she did not exercise strenuously\", which can be represented as \"E \u2192 ~S\" (where E represents \"Ann exercised\" and S represents \"Ann exercised strenuously\").\n\nThe conclusion is \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise\", which can be represented as \"S \u2192 ~E\".\n\nTo see if the conclusion follows from the premise, we can try to derive the conclusion from the premise using logical rules. One possible approach is to use the rule of contraposition, which states that \"P \u2192 Q\" is equivalent to \"~Q \u2192 ~P\".\n\nApplying contraposition to the premise \"E \u2192 ~S\", we get \"~S \u2192 ~E\", which is equivalent to \"S \u2192 ~E\" (by swapping the antecedent and consequent). This is exactly the conclusion we are trying to derive.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise using a valid logical rule.\n\nAnswer: yes",
