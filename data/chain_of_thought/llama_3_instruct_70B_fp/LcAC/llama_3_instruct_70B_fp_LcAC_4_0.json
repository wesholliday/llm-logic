There could be other reasons why the consequent is true.\n\nIn this case, we know the robot visited Jupiter, but that doesn't provide enough information to conclude that the alien visited Mars. The robot's visit to Jupiter could be due to other reasons unrelated to the alien's visit to Mars.\n\nAnswer: no",
