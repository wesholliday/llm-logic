'Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden' - This statement presents two possible locations for Fido: inside or in the garden. It implies that Fido must be in one of these two locations.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from these two statements. We know Fido is not in the garden (from statement 1). The second statement tells us that Fido must be in one of the two locations: inside or in the garden. Since we've already ruled out the garden, the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
