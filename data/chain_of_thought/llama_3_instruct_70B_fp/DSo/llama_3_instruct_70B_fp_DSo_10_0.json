It implies that the missing sock must be in one of these two locations.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from both statements. We know the missing sock isn't under the bed (from statement 1). However, statement 2 tells us that the missing sock must be in one of the two locations: the laundry basket or under the bed. Since we've already eliminated the possibility of it being under the bed, the only remaining option is the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
