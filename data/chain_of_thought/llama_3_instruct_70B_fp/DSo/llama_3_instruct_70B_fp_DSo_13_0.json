It implies that the toy must be in one of these two locations.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from these two statements. We know the toy is not on the shelf (from statement 1). The second statement tells us that the toy must be in one of two locations: the toy box or the shelf. Since we've already ruled out the shelf, the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
