Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it is draped on the coat rack.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that there are only two possible locations for the scarf: either it's in the backpack or it's on the coat rack. Statement 1 tells us that it's not on the coat rack. Therefore, if it's not on the coat rack, and it can only be in one of these two places, then it must be in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
