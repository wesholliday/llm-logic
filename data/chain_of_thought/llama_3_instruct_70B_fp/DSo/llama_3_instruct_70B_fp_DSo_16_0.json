It's an \"either-or\" situation.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from both statements. We know the pen isn't on the desk (from statement 1). The second statement says it's either in the bag or on the desk, but we've already ruled out the \"on the desk\" option. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
