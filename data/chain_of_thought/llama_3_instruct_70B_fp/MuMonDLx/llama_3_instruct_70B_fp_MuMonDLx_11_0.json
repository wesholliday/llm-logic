This is because the alternative condition provides an additional way for the necessary condition to be satisfied.\n\nFor example, if it's true that a fizzle must be wobble, then it's also true that a fizzle must be either wobble or shimble, because being wobble is one way to satisfy the condition, and being shimble is another way.\n\nAnswer: yes",
