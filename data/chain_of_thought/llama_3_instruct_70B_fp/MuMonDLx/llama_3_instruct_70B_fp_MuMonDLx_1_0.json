            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is \"The floob must be snizzle a quank\". This statement asserts that the floob must have a specific property, namely being snizzle a quank. \n\nWhen we consider the new statement \"The floob must be snizzle a quank or wobble\", we can see that it includes the original property (being snizzle a quank) and adds an alternative property (being wobble). \n\nIn logic, when we add an alternative to a statement, it can only make the statement more likely to be true, not less likely. This is because the alternative provides an additional way for the statement to be true. \n\nTherefore, if the original statement is true, the new statement must also be true, because it includes the original property and adds an alternative.\n\nAnswer: yes",
