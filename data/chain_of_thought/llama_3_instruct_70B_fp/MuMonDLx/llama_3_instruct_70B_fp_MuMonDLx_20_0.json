This statement asserts that the wozzle has a certain property, namely being floob.\n\nThe proposed inference is 'The wozzle must be floob or glorp'. This statement is saying that the wozzle has either the property of being floob or the property of being glorp.\n\nIn logic, when we have a statement of the form 'A', we can infer 'A or B' because if A is true, then A or B must also be true (since A is one of the options). This is a valid inference rule.\n\nIn this case, we can apply this rule to the original statement. Since 'The wozzle must be floob' is true, we can infer that 'The wozzle must be floob or glorp' is also true, because being floob satisfies the condition of being either floob or glorp.\n\nAnswer: yes",
