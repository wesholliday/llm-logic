Now, we are asked to infer whether we can conclude 'The grooble must be plonk wobble or flonk wozzle bimboozle' from the base statement. \n\nIn logic, when we have a statement 'A', we can always infer 'A or B' because 'A or B' is a broader statement that includes 'A' as a possibility. This is because 'or' is an inclusive operator, meaning that if 'A' is true, then 'A or B' is also true, regardless of the truth value of 'B'. \n\nIn this case, we can infer 'The grooble must be plonk wobble or flonk wozzle bimboozle' from 'The grooble must be plonk wobble' because the former includes the latter as a possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
