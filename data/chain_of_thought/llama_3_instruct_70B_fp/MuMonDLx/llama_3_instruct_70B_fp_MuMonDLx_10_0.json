            "content": "Explanation: \n\nWhen we have a statement 'The frazzle must be froodle', it means that being froodle is a necessary condition for something to be a frazzle. In other words, if something is a frazzle, then it must also be froodle.\n\nNow, if we add 'or wobble' to the original statement, we are essentially saying that being froodle or wobble is a necessary condition for something to be a frazzle. This means that if something is a frazzle, then it must be either froodle or wobble (or possibly both).\n\nSince the original statement only guarantees that a frazzle is froodle, it is still possible that a frazzle could also be wobble. Therefore, adding 'or wobble' to the original statement does not contradict the original statement, and we can infer that 'The frazzle must be froodle or wobble'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
