            "content": "Explanation: \n\nWhen we have a statement \"The quorple must be in quazzle\", it implies that the quorple's location is restricted to quazzle and nowhere else. \n\nNow, if we add an alternative \"or zizz zump wobble\" to the original statement, we are essentially expanding the possible locations where the quorple can be. \n\nIn other words, the new statement \"The quorple must be in quazzle or zizz zump wobble\" is saying that the quorple's location is restricted to either quazzle or zizz zump wobble. \n\nSince the original statement only mentioned quazzle, and the new statement includes quazzle as one of the options, we can infer that the new statement is indeed true if the original statement is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
