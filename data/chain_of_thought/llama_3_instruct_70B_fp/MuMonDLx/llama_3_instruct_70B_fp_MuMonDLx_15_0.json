This is because the original statement is still true, and we are just adding more options that might also be true. \n\nIn this case, the original statement is 'The crunk must be zooble zibber grooble'. We can add 'or blimple blurble flibbit' to it, which means that the crunk might also be blimple blurble flibbit, in addition to being zooble zibber grooble. \n\nThis is a valid inference because we are not changing the original statement, we are just providing more possibilities. \n\nAnswer: yes",
