Now, we are asked to infer whether 'The grazzle must be snork on zibble or wump wump wozzle' is true or not. \n\nIn logic, when we have a statement 'A', we can always infer 'A or B' to be true, because 'A or B' is true as long as 'A' is true, regardless of the truth value of 'B'. This is because 'or' is an inclusive operator, meaning that if one of the conditions is true, the whole statement is true.\n\nIn this case, we can infer 'The grazzle must be snork on zibble or wump wump wozzle' to be true because 'The grazzle must be snork on zibble' is true, and adding 'or wump wump wozzle' does not change the fact that the statement is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
