            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"F \u2192 B\", where F stands for \"the wug was flooped\" and B stands for \"the wug bimmed the zoint\".\n2. \"The wug did not bim the zoint\" - This statement can be represented as \"\u00acB\", where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The wug was not flooped\", which can be represented as \"\u00acF\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if F is true, then B must also be true (F \u2192 B). However, the second statement tells us that B is actually false (\u00acB). This means that the condition \"F \u2192 B\" cannot be true, because B is false.\n\nSince F \u2192 B is equivalent to \u00acF \u2228 B (not F or B), and we know that B is false, the only way for the statement to be true is if \u00acF is true. Therefore, we can conclude that the wug was not flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
