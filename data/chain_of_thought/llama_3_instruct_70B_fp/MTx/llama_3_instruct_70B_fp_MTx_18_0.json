            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"P \u2192 N\", where P stands for \"the shank was plooked\" and N stands for \"the shank was nugged\".\n2. \"The shank was not nugged\" - This statement can be represented as \"\u00acN\", where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The shank was not plooked\", which can be represented as \"\u00acP\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if P is true, then N must also be true. However, the second statement tells us that N is actually false (\u00acN). This means that the condition \"P \u2192 N\" cannot be true when N is false.\n\nUsing modus tollens, a rule of inference, we can conclude that if P \u2192 N and \u00acN, then \u00acP. In other words, if the shank was not nugged, then it cannot be the case that the shank was plooked, because if it were plooked, it would have been nugged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
