            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Snurgled \u2192 Crinked\".\n2. \"The fribble did not crink\" - This statement tells us that the consequence of the conditional statement (Crinked) is false.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the fribble was snurgled, then it would have crinked (according to statement 1). But we know that the fribble did not crink (statement 2). This means that the condition \"Snurgled\" cannot be true, because if it were, the fribble would have crinked, which is not the case.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
