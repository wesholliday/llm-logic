            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Sploffed \u2192 Plopped\" (if the grommet was sploffed, then it must have plopped the frink).\n2. \"The grommet did not plop the frink\" - This statement denies the consequence of the conditional statement, i.e., the grommet did not plop the frink. This can be represented as \"\u00acPlopped\" (not plopped).\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the grommet was sploffed, it would have plopped the frink (according to the conditional statement). However, we know that the grommet did not plop the frink. This means that the condition \"Sploffed\" cannot be true, because if it were, the grommet would have plopped the frink, which is not the case.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
