            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"C \u2192 D\", where \"C\" stands for \"the sprocket was cranked\" and \"D\" stands for \"the sprocket was daggled\".\n\n2. \"The sprocket was not daggled\" - This statement can be represented as \"\u00acD\", where \"\u00ac\" denotes negation.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf \"C \u2192 D\" is true, and \"\u00acD\" is also true, then we can conclude that \"\u00acC\" must be true. This is because if \"C\" were true, then \"D\" would have to be true (due to the conditional statement), but we know that \"D\" is not true. Therefore, \"C\" cannot be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
