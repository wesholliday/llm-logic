            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"M \u2192 Q\", where M stands for \"the splat was morphed\" and Q stands for \"the splat quanked\".\n2. \"The splat did not quank\" - This statement can be represented as \"\u00acQ\", where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The splat was not morphed\", which can be represented as \"\u00acM\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if M is true, then Q must also be true. However, the second statement tells us that Q is actually false (\u00acQ). This means that the condition \"M \u2192 Q\" cannot be true when Q is false. Therefore, we can conclude that M must be false, because if M were true, Q would also be true, but we know Q is false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
