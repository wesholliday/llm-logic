            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the sneg was crampled\" and B is \"the sneg sproted the frink\".\n2. \"The sneg did not sproted the frink\" - This statement negates the consequence B, i.e., the sneg did not sprot the frink.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the sneg was crampled (A), then it should have sproted the frink (B) according to the first statement. However, the second statement tells us that the sneg did not sprot the frink (not B). This means that the condition \"the sneg was crampled\" (A) cannot be true, because if it were, the sneg would have sproted the frink, which is not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
