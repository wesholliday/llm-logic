            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\nWe have two statements:\n\n1. If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled. (This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\" or \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"the wug was sproinged\" and B is \"it was garpled\".)\n2. The wug was not garpled. (This is a negation of statement B, which can be represented as \"not B\" or \"\u00acB\".)\n\nNow, let's see if we can infer \"The wug was not sproinged\" (\u00acA) from these two statements.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if A is true, then B must be true. However, statement 2 tells us that B is not true (\u00acB). This means that the condition \"If A, then B\" cannot be satisfied, because B is false.\n\nUsing modus tollens, a logical rule of inference, we can conclude that if A \u2192 B and \u00acB, then \u00acA. In this case, if \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" and \"The wug was not garpled\", then we can infer \"The wug was not sproinged\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
