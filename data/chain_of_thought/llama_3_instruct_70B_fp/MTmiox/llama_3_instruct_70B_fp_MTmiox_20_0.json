But this contradicts statement 1, which says it might not have been surned.\n* If the fleeg was not bluttered, then statement 2 doesn't provide any information about whether it was surned or not. In this case, statement 1 is still true, as it's possible that the fleeg was not surned.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can conclude that the only way to avoid a contradiction is to assume that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
