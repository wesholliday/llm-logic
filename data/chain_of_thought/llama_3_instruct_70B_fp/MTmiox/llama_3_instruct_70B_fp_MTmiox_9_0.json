It means that if the twonk was plinked, then it necessarily follows that it was varnished.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n* If the twonk was plinked, then according to statement 2, it must have been varnished. But this contradicts statement 1, which suggests that the twonk might not have been varnished.\n* If the twonk was not plinked, then statement 2 does not provide any information about whether it was varnished or not. In this case, statement 1 is still possible, as the twonk might not have been varnished.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that the only way to reconcile the two statements is if the twonk was not plinked. If it was plinked, then it would have been varnished, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
