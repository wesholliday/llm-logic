            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. 'The splat might not have quanked' - This statement implies that it's possible that the splat did not quank.\n2. 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked' - This statement sets up a conditional relationship between the splat being morphed and the splat quanking. It means that if the splat was morphed, then it necessarily quanked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the splat was morphed, then according to statement 2, it must have quanked. But statement 1 says that the splat might not have quanked. This implies that the assumption that the splat was morphed leads to a contradiction (the splat both quanked and didn't quank). Therefore, we can conclude that the assumption that the splat was morphed must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
