The first statement says \"The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack\", which means we can be certain that the scarf is not on the coat rack. The second statement says \"Either the scarf is draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack\", which presents two possible locations for the scarf: the coat rack or the backpack. \n\nSince we know the scarf is not on the coat rack (from the first statement), the only remaining possibility is that it is stuffed in the backpack. This is because the second statement says \"either...or\", implying that one of the two options must be true. \n\nAnswer: yes",
