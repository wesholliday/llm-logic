It's an \"either-or\" situation, which means that one of the two options must be true.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from both statements. We know the book isn't on the table (from statement 1), and we know that it's either on the table or on the shelf (from statement 2). Since it's not on the table, the only remaining possibility is that it's on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
