It implies that the missing sock must be in one of these two locations.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from these two statements. We know the missing sock isn't under the bed (from statement 1), and we know it must be in one of the two locations mentioned in statement 2. Since it's not under the bed, the only remaining possibility is that it's in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
