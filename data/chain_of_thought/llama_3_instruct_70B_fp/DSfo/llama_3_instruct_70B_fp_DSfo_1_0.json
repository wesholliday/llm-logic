'Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside' - This statement presents two possible locations for Fido: the garden or inside.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince we know Fido is not in the garden (from statement 1), we can eliminate the first option in the \"either-or\" statement. This means the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
