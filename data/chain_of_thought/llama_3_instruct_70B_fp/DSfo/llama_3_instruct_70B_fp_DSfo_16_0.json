It implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that the pen must be in one of these two locations.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from these two statements. We know the pen isn't on the desk (from statement 1). Since the pen must be in one of the two locations mentioned in statement 2, and it's not on the desk, the only remaining option is that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
