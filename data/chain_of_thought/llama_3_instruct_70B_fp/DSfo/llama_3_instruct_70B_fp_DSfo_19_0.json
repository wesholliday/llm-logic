The second statement is \"Either the watch is on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser\", which presents two possible scenarios: the watch is on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser. \n\nSince we know the watch isn't on his wrist (from the first statement), we can eliminate the first scenario. This leaves us with the second scenario, which is that the watch is charging on the dresser. \n\nAnswer: yes",
