The second statement says \"Either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer\", which means the keys are either in the cabinet or in the drawer, but we don't know which one. \n\nNow, since we know the keys are not in the cabinet (from the first statement), and the keys are either in the cabinet or in the drawer (from the second statement), we can conclude that the keys must be in the drawer. This is because the only other option (the cabinet) has been ruled out.\n\nAnswer: yes",
