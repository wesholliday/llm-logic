This means the first part of the \"or\" statement in statement 2 is false.\n\nSince statement 2 is an \"either-or\" statement, and one part is false (the phone isn't ringing in the kitchen), the other part must be true for the entire statement to be true. Therefore, the phone must be in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes",
