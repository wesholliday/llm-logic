The second statement says \"Either the newspaper is sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway\", which means the newspaper is either on the porch or in the driveway, but we don't know which one.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from both statements. We know the newspaper isn't on the porch (from the first statement), and we know it's either on the porch or in the driveway (from the second statement). Since it's not on the porch, the only other option is that it must be in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes",
