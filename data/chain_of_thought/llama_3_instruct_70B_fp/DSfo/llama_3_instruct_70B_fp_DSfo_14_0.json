It's an \"either-or\" situation, which means that one of the options must be true.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from both statements. We know the milk isn't in the fridge (from statement 1). Since the milk can't be in the fridge, the only remaining possibility is that it's on the counter (from statement 2).\n\nAnswer: yes",
