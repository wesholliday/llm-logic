The second statement says \"Either the toy is sitting on the shelf or it is in the toy box\", which means the toy is either on the shelf or in the toy box, but we don't know which one. \n\nNow, we know the toy is not on the shelf (from the first statement), so the only other possibility is that it is in the toy box. This is because the second statement says it's either on the shelf or in the toy box, and we've already ruled out the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
