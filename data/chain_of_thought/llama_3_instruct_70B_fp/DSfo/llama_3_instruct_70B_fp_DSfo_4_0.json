The \"or\" here is an inclusive or, meaning that both options could be true, but in this case, we know from statement 1 that the cat is not playing in the bedroom.\n\nSince the cat is not playing in the bedroom, the only remaining possibility from statement 2 is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
