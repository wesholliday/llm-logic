This statement is denying the necessity of the notebook being in the drawer. In other words, it's saying that it's not necessarily true that the notebook is in the drawer. \n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"The notebook might not be in the drawer\". This statement is expressing the possibility that the notebook is not in the drawer. \n\nSince the original statement is denying the necessity of the notebook being in the drawer, it implies that there is a possibility that the notebook is not in the drawer. This aligns with the meaning of \"The notebook might not be in the drawer\". \n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The notebook might not be in the drawer\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
