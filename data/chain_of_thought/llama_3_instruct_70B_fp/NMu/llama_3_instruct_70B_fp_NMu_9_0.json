            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" implies that there is no necessity or obligation for Lisa to have bought the red shirt. This means that Lisa's buying the red shirt is not a guaranteed or required outcome.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, because there is no necessity for her to have done so. This is equivalent to saying \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\", which expresses the possibility of Lisa not having bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
