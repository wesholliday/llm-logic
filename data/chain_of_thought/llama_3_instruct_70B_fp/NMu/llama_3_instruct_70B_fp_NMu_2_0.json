This statement is denying the necessity of the griffin being in the forest. In other words, it's saying that it's not necessarily true that the griffin was in the forest.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"The griffin might not have been in the forest\". This statement is expressing the possibility that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nSince the original statement is denying the necessity of the griffin being in the forest, it implies that there's a possibility that the griffin was not in the forest. This aligns with the statement we want to infer, which is also expressing the possibility of the griffin not being in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
