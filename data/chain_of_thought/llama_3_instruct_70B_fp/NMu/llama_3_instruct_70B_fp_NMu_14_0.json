This statement is denying the necessity of the milk being on the counter. In other words, it's saying that it's not necessarily true that the milk is on the counter. \n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"The milk might not be on the counter\". This statement is expressing a possibility that the milk is not on the counter. \n\nSince the original statement is denying the necessity of the milk being on the counter, it implies that there is a possibility that the milk is not on the counter. This aligns with the meaning of \"The milk might not be on the counter\". \n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The milk might not be on the counter\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
