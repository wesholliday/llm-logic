This means that there is a possibility that the watch is not charging on the dresser. \n\nThe inference \"The watch might not be charging on the dresser\" is saying the same thing, but in a more explicit way. It's stating that there is a possibility that the watch is not charging on the dresser, which is consistent with the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
