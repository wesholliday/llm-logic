This does not necessarily mean that Alex did not finish the race, but rather that we lack sufficient evidence to guarantee that Alex finished.\n\nThe phrase \"might not have finished\" implies a possibility or uncertainty, which is exactly what the original statement conveys. Since we cannot be certain that Alex finished the race, it is possible that Alex did not finish.\n\nAnswer: yes",
