This does not necessarily mean that Sue did not choose pizza, but rather that we lack sufficient evidence to be 100% sure that she did.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that there is a possibility that Sue might have chosen pizza, but we cannot rule out the possibility that she might not have chosen pizza either. In other words, the statement leaves open the possibility that Sue might not have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
