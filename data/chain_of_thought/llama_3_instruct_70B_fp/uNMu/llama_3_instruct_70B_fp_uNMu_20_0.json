This means that the presence of the sunglasses in her bag is not guaranteed or obligatory. \n\nHowever, this statement does not provide any information about the actual presence or absence of the sunglasses in her bag. It only rules out the possibility that they must be there. \n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sunglasses might not be in her bag, because there is no requirement for them to be there. But we cannot infer that they are definitely not in her bag, because the statement does not provide that information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
