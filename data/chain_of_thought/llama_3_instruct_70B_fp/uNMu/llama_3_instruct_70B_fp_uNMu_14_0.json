            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter\" implies that there is no necessity or requirement for the milk to be on the counter. This means that the milk's presence on the counter is not a guaranteed or obligatory fact. \n\nFrom this, we can infer that the milk's presence on the counter is not a certainty, and it's possible that the milk might not be on the counter. This is because the absence of a necessity or requirement for the milk to be on the counter leaves room for alternative possibilities, including the possibility that the milk is not on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
