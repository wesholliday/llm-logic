This does not necessarily mean that the griffin was not in the forest, but rather that we lack sufficient evidence to prove its presence.\n\nThe phrase \"might not have been\" implies a possibility or uncertainty, which is different from a definitive statement of absence. In this case, we are not claiming that the griffin was definitely not in the forest, but rather that we cannot rule out the possibility that it was not there.\n\nAnswer: yes",
