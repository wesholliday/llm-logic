If the puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor (Statement 1), and it's either in the box or blending in on the floor (Statement 2), then it's possible that the puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nHowever, we can't conclude with absolute certainty that the puzzle piece is in the box. There might be other possibilities not mentioned in the statements, such as the puzzle piece being somewhere else entirely.\n\nAnswer: no",
