'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' is an exclusive or statement, meaning that one of the two options must be true. If Fido is inside, then Fido must not be in the garden. If Fido is not inside, then Fido must be in the garden.\n\nNow, let's combine the two statements. If Fido might not be in the garden (from statement 1), then the second option in statement 2 ('Fido must be in the garden') is not possible. Therefore, the only remaining option is that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
