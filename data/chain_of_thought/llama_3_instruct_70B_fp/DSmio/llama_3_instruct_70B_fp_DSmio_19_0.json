The use of \"either...or\" implies that these are the only two possibilities.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from these two statements. If the watch might not be on his wrist (from statement 1), and the only two possibilities are that it's either on his wrist or charging on the dresser (from statement 2), then it's reasonable to conclude that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
