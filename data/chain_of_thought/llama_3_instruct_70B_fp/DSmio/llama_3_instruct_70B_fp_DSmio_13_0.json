It's an \"either-or\" situation.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements. If the toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf (from statement 1), then according to statement 2, it must be in the toy box. This is because statement 2 presents an exclusive \"either-or\" situation, and if one option (on the bookshelf) is not true, the other option (in the toy box) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
