This statement is denying the necessity of the dreb being vroombed. In other words, it's saying that it's not necessarily true that the dreb was vroombed.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the dreb's being vroombed is not a guaranteed or necessary outcome. This leaves open the possibility that the dreb might not have been vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
