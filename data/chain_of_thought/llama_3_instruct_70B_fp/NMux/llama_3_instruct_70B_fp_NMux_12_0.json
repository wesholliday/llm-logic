This statement is denying the necessity of the smip being shripped. In other words, it's saying that it's not necessarily true that the smip was shripped.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"The smip might not have been shripped\". This statement is expressing the possibility that the smip was not shripped.\n\nSince the original statement is denying the necessity of the smip being shripped, it implies that there's a possibility that the smip was not shripped. This aligns with the statement we want to infer, which is also expressing the possibility of the smip not being shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
