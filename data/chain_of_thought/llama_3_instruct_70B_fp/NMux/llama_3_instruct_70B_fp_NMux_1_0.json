This statement is denying the necessity of the flugel being blimmed. In other words, it's saying that it's not necessarily true that the flugel was blimmed.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"The flugel might not have been blimmed\". This statement is expressing the possibility that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nSince the original statement is denying the necessity of the flugel being blimmed, it implies that there's a possibility that the flugel was not blimmed. This aligns with the statement \"The flugel might not have been blimmed\", which is also expressing the possibility of the flugel not being blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
