This statement is denying the necessity of the clug being fleeked. In other words, it's saying that it's not necessarily true that the clug was fleeked.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"The clug might not have been fleeked\". This statement is expressing the possibility that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nSince the original statement is denying the necessity of the clug being fleeked, it implies that there's a possibility that the clug was not fleeked. This aligns with the statement \"The clug might not have been fleeked\", which is also expressing the possibility of the clug not being fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
