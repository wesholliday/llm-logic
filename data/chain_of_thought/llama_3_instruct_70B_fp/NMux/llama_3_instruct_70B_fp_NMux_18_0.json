This statement is denying the necessity of the shank being plooked. In other words, it's saying that it's not necessarily true that the shank was plooked.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that there's a possibility that the shank was not plooked. If it's not necessary for the shank to be plooked, then it's possible that it wasn't plooked. This is equivalent to saying \"The shank might not have been plooked\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
