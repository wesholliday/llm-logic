This statement is denying the necessity of the fribble being snurgled. In other words, it's saying that it's not necessarily true that the fribble was snurgled.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: \"The fribble might not have been snurgled\". This statement is expressing the possibility that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nSince the original statement is denying the necessity of the fribble being snurgled, it implies that there's a possibility that the fribble was not snurgled. This aligns with the statement we want to infer, which is also expressing the possibility of the fribble not being snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
