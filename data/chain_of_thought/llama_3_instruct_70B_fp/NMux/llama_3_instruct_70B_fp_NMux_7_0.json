This statement is denying the necessity of the whiffle being shanked. In other words, it's saying that it's not necessarily true that the whiffle was shanked.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"The whiffle might not have been shanked\". This statement is expressing the possibility that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nThe key connection between these two statements is that if it's not necessary for the whiffle to have been shanked, then it's possible that it wasn't shanked. In other words, the lack of necessity implies the possibility of the opposite.\n\nAnswer: yes",
