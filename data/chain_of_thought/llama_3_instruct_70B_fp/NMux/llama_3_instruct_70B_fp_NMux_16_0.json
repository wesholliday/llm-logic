This statement is denying the necessity of the sneg being crampled. In other words, it's saying that it's not necessarily true that the sneg was crampled.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that there's a possibility that the sneg was not crampled. If it was necessarily true that the sneg was crampled, then the original statement would be false. But since the original statement is true, it means that there's a possibility that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nThis is equivalent to saying \"The sneg might not have been crampled\", which means that there's a possibility that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
