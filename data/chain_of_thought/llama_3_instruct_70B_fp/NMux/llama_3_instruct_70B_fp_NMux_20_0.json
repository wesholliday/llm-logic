This statement is denying the necessity of the fleeg being bluttered. In other words, it's saying that it's not necessarily true that the fleeg was bluttered.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered\". This statement is expressing the possibility that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nSince the original statement is denying the necessity of the fleeg being bluttered, it implies that there's a possibility that the fleeg was not bluttered. This aligns with the statement \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered\", which is also expressing the possibility of the fleeg not being bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
