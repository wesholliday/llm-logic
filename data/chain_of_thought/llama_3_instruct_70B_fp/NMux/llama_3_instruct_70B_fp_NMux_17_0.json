This statement is denying the necessity of the flob being skizzled. In other words, it's saying that it's not necessarily true that the flob was skizzled.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"The flob might not have been skizzled\". This statement is expressing the possibility that the flob was not skizzled.\n\nSince the original statement is denying the necessity of the flob being skizzled, it implies that there's a possibility that the flob was not skizzled. This aligns with the meaning of \"The flob might not have been skizzled\", which is also expressing a possibility.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flob might not have been skizzled\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
