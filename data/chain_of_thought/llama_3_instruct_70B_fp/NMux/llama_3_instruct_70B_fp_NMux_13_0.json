This statement is denying the necessity of the glip being slogged. In other words, it's saying that it's not necessarily true that the glip was slogged.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statement we want to infer: \"The glip might not have been slogged\". This statement is expressing the possibility that the glip was not slogged.\n\nSince the original statement denies the necessity of the glip being slogged, it leaves room for the possibility that the glip was not slogged. In other words, if it's not necessary that the glip was slogged, then it's possible that it wasn't slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
