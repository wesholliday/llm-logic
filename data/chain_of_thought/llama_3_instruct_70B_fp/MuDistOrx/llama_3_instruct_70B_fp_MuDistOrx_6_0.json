            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The blimp must gribble a flonk or gribble a wibble snorkel\" can be broken down into two parts: \"The blimp must gribble a flonk\" and \"gribble a wibble snorkel\". The \"or\" connector implies that if one part is not true, the other part must be true. \n\nIn the inferred statement \"The blimp must gribble a flonk or it must gribble a wibble snorkel\", the phrase \"it must gribble a wibble snorkel\" is equivalent to \"the blimp must gribble a wibble snorkel\" because \"it\" refers back to \"the blimp\". \n\nSince the original statement and the inferred statement have the same meaning, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
