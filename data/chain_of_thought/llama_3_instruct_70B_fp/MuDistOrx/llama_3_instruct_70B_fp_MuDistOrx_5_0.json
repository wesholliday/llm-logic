            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The plonk must be on wibble or on shimble\" implies that there are only two possible locations for the plonk: wibble or shimble. The phrase \"or on shimble\" suggests that if the plonk is not on wibble, then it must be on shimble. This is equivalent to saying that if the plonk is not on wibble, then it must be on shimble, which is the same as saying \"The plonk must be on wibble or it must be on shimble\". \n\nAnswer: yes",
