It's an \"or\" statement, which means only one of the options needs to be true.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from both statements. We know the grommet is not plopped (from statement 1). The second statement says it's either sploffed or plopped, but we've already ruled out the \"plopped\" option. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
