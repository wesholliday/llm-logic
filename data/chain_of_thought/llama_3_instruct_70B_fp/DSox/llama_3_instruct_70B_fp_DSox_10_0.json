'The wug is not garpled' - This statement tells us that the wug is definitely not garpled.\n\n2. 'Either the wug is sproinged or it is garpled' - This statement presents us with two possibilities: the wug is either sproinged or garpled. It's an \"either-or\" situation.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from these two statements. We know the wug is not garpled (from statement 1). This means that the \"or it is garpled\" part of statement 2 cannot be true. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
