It's an \"or\" statement, which means only one of the conditions needs to be true.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from both statements. We know the clug is not snugged (from statement 1). If it's not snugged, then the only other possibility is that it's fleeked (from statement 2). This is because the \"or\" statement in the second sentence implies that if one condition is not true, the other must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
