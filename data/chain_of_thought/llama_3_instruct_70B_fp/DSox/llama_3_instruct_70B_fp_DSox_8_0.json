It's an \"or\" statement, which means only one of the options needs to be true.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from both statements. We know the sprocket is not daggled (from statement 1). If it's not daggled, then the only other possibility left is that it's cranked (from statement 2). This is because the \"or\" statement in the second sentence implies that one of the options must be true, and since daggled is ruled out, cranked is the only remaining option.\n\nAnswer: yes",
