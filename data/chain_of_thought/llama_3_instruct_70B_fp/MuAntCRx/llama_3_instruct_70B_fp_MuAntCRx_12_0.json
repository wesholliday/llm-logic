We want to know if we can infer \"The frozz must be flump frazzle and be fizzle blimple\" from this statement. \n\nTo make this inference, we would need to assume that \"flump frazzle\" is somehow related to or implied by \"fizzle blimple\". However, there is no logical connection or implication between these two phrases. \"Fizzle blimple\" does not provide any information about \"flump frazzle\", and we cannot conclude that something that is \"fizzle blimple\" must also be \"flump frazzle\". \n\nTherefore, we cannot make this inference based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
