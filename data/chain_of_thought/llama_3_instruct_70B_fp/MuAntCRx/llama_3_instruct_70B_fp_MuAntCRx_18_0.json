We want to know if we can infer \"The wobble must be glorp quank quork and be quork fizzle frozz\". \n\nTo make this inference, we would need to add \"glorp quank\" to the original statement, which is not justified based on the information provided. The original statement only mentions \"quork fizzle frozz\", but not \"glorp quank\". \n\nAdditionally, the original statement does not imply any connection between \"quork fizzle frozz\" and \"glorp quank quork\". The phrase \"and be\" is also not present in the original statement, which further suggests that we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
