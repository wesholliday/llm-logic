This statement asserts that being flump is a necessary condition for the glorp.\n\nThe proposed inference is 'The glorp must be snizzle and be flump'. This statement adds an additional condition, being snizzle, to the original statement.\n\nHowever, there is no logical connection between being flump and being snizzle. The original statement does not provide any information about being snizzle, and it does not imply that being snizzle is a necessary condition for the glorp.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the proposed statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
