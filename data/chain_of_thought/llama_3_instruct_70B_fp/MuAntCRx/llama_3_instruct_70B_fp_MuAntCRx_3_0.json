We are asked to infer whether we can conclude \"The wobble must fribble quorple and frozz fizzle\" from the original statement. \n\nTo make this inference, we would need to add new information (\"fribble quorple\") to the original statement, which is not justified. The original statement only talks about \"frozz fizzle\" and does not provide any information about \"fribble quorple\". \n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: no",
