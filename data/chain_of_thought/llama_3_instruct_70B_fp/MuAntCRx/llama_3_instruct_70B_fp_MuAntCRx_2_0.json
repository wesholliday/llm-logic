We are asked to infer whether we can conclude 'The grazzle must glorp a zibble snizzle and flump a bimboozle quazzle'. \n\nTo make this inference, we need to determine if the original statement implies the additional information 'The grazzle must glorp a zibble snizzle'. However, there is no logical connection between the original statement and the additional information. The original statement only talks about the grazzle flumping a bimboozle quazzle, but it does not provide any information about the grazzle glorp-ing a zibble snizzle.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the additional information from the original statement. The original statement only guarantees that the grazzle must flump a bimboozle quazzle, but it does not provide any information about glorp-ing a zibble snizzle.\n\nAnswer: no",
