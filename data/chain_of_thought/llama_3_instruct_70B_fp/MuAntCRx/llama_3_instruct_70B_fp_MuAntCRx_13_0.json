We are asked to infer whether we can conclude \"The crunk must quork gribble and quazzle quorple\". \n\nTo make this inference, we need to determine if the original statement implies the additional information \"quork gribble\". However, there is no logical connection between \"quazzle quorple\" and \"quork gribble\" in the original statement. The original statement only talks about \"quazzle quorple\" and does not provide any information about \"quork gribble\". \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the additional information \"quork gribble\" from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: no",
