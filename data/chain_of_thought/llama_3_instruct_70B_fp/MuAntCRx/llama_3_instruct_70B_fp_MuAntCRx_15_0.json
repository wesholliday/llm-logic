The original statement is \"The zibble must glorp a flonk\". This statement only mentions the zibble, glorp, and flonk, but does not mention grooble or quazzle.\n\nThe proposed inference adds new information, \"The zibble must grooble a quazzle\", which is not present in the original statement. This new information cannot be logically deduced from the original statement. The original statement only talks about glorp and flonk, but not about grooble or quazzle.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the proposed statement from the original statement because it introduces new, unrelated information.\n\nAnswer: no",
