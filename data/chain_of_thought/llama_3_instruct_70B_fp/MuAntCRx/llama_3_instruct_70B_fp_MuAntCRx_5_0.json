We are asked to infer whether we can conclude \"The plonk must zibber for and be shimble for\" from this statement. \n\nTo make this inference, we would need some information about the relationship between \"zibber\" and \"shimble\". However, we are not provided with any such information. \n\nThe only thing we can say for certain is that the original statement tells us that the plonk must be shimble for something, but it does not provide any information about zibber. \n\nTherefore, we cannot make any conclusions about zibber based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
