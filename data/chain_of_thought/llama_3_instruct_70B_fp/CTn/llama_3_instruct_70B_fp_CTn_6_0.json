This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Sue chose pizza \u2192 Bob did not choose pasta\". \n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\" from the given statement. This new statement can be represented as \"Bob chose pasta \u2192 Sue did not choose pizza\". \n\nTo determine if we can make this inference, let's analyze the given statement. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta. This means that if Sue chose pizza, Bob's choice is restricted to not being pasta. However, it does not provide any direct information about what Sue's choice would be if Bob chose pasta. \n\nBut, we can try to find a connection. If Bob chose pasta, it would mean that Sue did not choose pizza (because if Sue chose pizza, Bob would not have chosen pasta). This is the contrapositive of the original statement, which is a logically equivalent statement. \n\nThe contrapositive of \"Sue chose pizza \u2192 Bob did not choose pasta\" is indeed \"Bob chose pasta \u2192 Sue did not choose pizza\". Since the contrapositive of a true statement is also true, we can infer the new statement from the given one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
