This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Tom watches football \u2192 Jen does not watch basketball\". \n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football\". This can be represented as \"Jen watches basketball \u2192 Tom does not watch football\". \n\nTo determine if we can make this inference, let's analyze the original statement. If Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball. This implies that if Jen did watch basketball, then Tom must not have watched football (because if Tom had watched football, Jen wouldn't have watched basketball). \n\nThis is a classic example of a contrapositive argument. The contrapositive of \"Tom watches football \u2192 Jen does not watch basketball\" is indeed \"Jen watches basketball \u2192 Tom does not watch football\". \n\nAnswer: yes",
