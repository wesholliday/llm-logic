            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"J \u2192 \u00acA\", where \"J\" represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \"A\" represents \"Amy played tennis\". \n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\", which can be represented as \"A \u2192 \u00acJ\". \n\nTo determine if we can make this inference, let's analyze the original statement. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis. This means that if Jeff played basketball, Amy must have done something else, which in this case is not playing tennis. \n\nNow, let's consider the opposite scenario: if Amy played tennis, what can we say about Jeff? Well, if Amy played tennis, it's possible that Jeff played basketball, but it's also possible that he didn't. The original statement doesn't provide enough information to determine what Jeff did if Amy played tennis. \n\nHowever, we can make a connection between the two scenarios. If Jeff playing basketball implies Amy not playing tennis, then it's reasonable to assume that if Amy played tennis, Jeff must not have played basketball. This is because if Jeff had played basketball, Amy would not have played tennis, according to the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes",
