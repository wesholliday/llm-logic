            "content": "Explanation: Let's analyze the given statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel\". This statement can be represented as \"If P, then not Q\", where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel\".\n\nTo determine if we can infer the new statement \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James\", we need to examine the logical structure of the original statement. The original statement implies that if James wrote the book, it cannot be a mystery novel. This means that if the book is a mystery novel, it's likely that James did not write it.\n\nIn logical terms, we can convert the original statement \"If P, then not Q\" to its contrapositive form, which is \"If Q, then not P\". This is a valid logical inference, as it maintains the same truth value as the original statement.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive form would be \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James\", which is the desired inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
