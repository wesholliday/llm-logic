            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"J \u2192 \u00acL\", where \"J\" represents \"Joe went to the park\" and \"L\" represents \"Lucy went to the zoo\".\n\nTo infer the new statement \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\", we need to check if it is logically equivalent to the original statement. This new statement can be represented as \"L \u2192 \u00acJ\".\n\nNotice that the original statement \"J \u2192 \u00acL\" implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo. This means that if Lucy did go to the zoo, then Joe must not have gone to the park (because if he did, Lucy wouldn't have gone to the zoo). This is exactly what the new statement \"L \u2192 \u00acJ\" says.\n\nTherefore, the new statement is indeed a logical consequence of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
