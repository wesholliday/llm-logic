            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was not blue\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was not blue\". \n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"If the truck was blue, then the car was not red\" from the original statement. This new statement can be represented as \"If R, then not P\", where R is \"the truck was blue\". \n\nTo determine if we can make this inference, let's analyze the original statement. If the car was red (P), then the truck was not blue (Q). This implies that if the truck was blue (R), then the car cannot be red (not P). This is because if the truck was blue, it would contradict the original statement, which says that if the car is red, the truck cannot be blue. \n\nTherefore, we can conclude that if the truck was blue, then the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
