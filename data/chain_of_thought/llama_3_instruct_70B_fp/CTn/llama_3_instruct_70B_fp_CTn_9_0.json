            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where \"P\" is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \"Q\" is \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\".\n\nTo determine if we can infer the converse statement, \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\", we need to examine the logical structure of the original statement.\n\nThe original statement implies that if Lisa buys the red shirt, it necessarily means Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This does not directly imply the converse, but we can try to derive it.\n\nIf we negate the original statement, we get \"\u00ac(P \u2192 Q)\", which is equivalent to \"P \u2227 \u00acQ\". This means \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \"Mark bought the blue shirt\".\n\nNow, let's examine the converse statement: \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\". This can be represented as \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\".\n\nNotice that \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\" is the contrapositive of the original statement \"P \u2192 Q\". In propositional logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the converse statement \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
