            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was not outside.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the dog was inside\" and Q is \"the cat was not outside\". \n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside\" from the original statement. This new statement can be represented as \"If not Q, then not P\". \n\nWe can use the concept of contrapositive to help us here. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\", which is always true if the original statement is true. \n\nIn this case, the original statement is \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was not outside\", and the contrapositive is \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside\". Since the contrapositive is always true if the original statement is true, we can infer the new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
