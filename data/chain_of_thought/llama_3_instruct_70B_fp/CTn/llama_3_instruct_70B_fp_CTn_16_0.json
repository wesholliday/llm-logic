            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were not denim\". \n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton\" from the original statement. This new statement can be represented as \"If R, then not P\", where R is \"the pants were denim\". \n\nTo determine if we can make this inference, let's analyze the original statement. If the shirt was cotton (P), then the pants were not denim (Q). This implies that if the pants were denim (R), it's possible that the shirt was not cotton (not P). \n\nHowever, we need to be careful here. The original statement only tells us that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim. It doesn't provide any information about what happens if the shirt was not cotton. \n\nFortunately, we can use a technique called \"contrapositive\" to help us. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\", which is always true if the original statement is true. \n\nIn our case, the contrapositive of \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim\" is \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton\". This is exactly the statement we're trying to infer! \n\nAnswer: yes",
