            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was not metal\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"P \u2192 \u00acM\", where P represents \"the doll was plastic\" and M represents \"the truck was metal\".\n\nTo determine if we can infer the new statement \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic\", we need to check if it is logically equivalent to the original statement. The new statement can be represented as \"M \u2192 \u00acP\".\n\nWe can use the rule of contrapositive, which states that \"P \u2192 \u00acM\" is equivalent to \"M \u2192 \u00acP\". This means that if the original statement is true, then the new statement must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
