            "content": "Explanation: Let's analyze the given statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den\". This statement implies a conditional relationship between the bear's presence in the cave and the wolf's absence from the den. \n\nTo infer the desired conclusion, \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave\", we need to examine the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". \n\nIn this case, the original statement is \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den\", which can be rewritten as \"If P (bear in cave), then Q (wolf not in den)\". The contrapositive would be \"If not Q (wolf in den), then not P (bear not in cave)\". \n\nThis contrapositive statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, and it matches the desired conclusion. Therefore, we can infer the desired conclusion from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
