            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\". This implies that Mary's presence at the wedding guarantees Sue's absence. \n\nNow, let's analyze the proposed inference: \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\". This statement claims that Sue's presence at the wedding guarantees Mary's absence. \n\nTo determine if we can infer this, we need to examine the logical connection between the two statements. If Mary's presence implies Sue's absence, it's reasonable to conclude that Sue's presence would imply Mary's absence. This is because the original statement establishes a mutual exclusivity between Mary and Sue's attendance at the wedding. \n\nIn other words, if Mary's presence rules out Sue's presence, then Sue's presence should also rule out Mary's presence. This is a classic example of a logical contrapositive, where we swap the antecedent and consequent of the original statement and negate both.\n\nAnswer: yes",
