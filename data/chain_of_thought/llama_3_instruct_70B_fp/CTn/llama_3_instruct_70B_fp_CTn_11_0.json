This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were not blueberry\". \n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\". This can be represented as \"If not Q, then not P\". \n\nIn logic, this is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is always true, and it is \"If not Q, then not P\". \n\nSo, in this case, the contrapositive of \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\" is indeed \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\". \n\nAnswer: yes",
