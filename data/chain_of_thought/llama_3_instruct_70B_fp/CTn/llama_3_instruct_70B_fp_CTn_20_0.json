            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was not yellow\". \n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red\" from the original statement. This new statement can be represented as \"If R, then not P\", where R is \"the banana was yellow\". \n\nTo determine if we can make this inference, let's analyze the relationships between the statements. If the original statement is true, it means that whenever the apple is red, the banana is not yellow. This implies that if the banana is yellow, the apple cannot be red (because if it were, the banana would not be yellow). \n\nThis is exactly what the new statement says: \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red\". Therefore, we can indeed infer this statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
