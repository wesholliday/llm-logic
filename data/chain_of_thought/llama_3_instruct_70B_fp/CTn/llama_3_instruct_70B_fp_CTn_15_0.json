This implies that if Sam took a plane, it is not possible for Erin to have taken a train. \n\nNow, let's analyze the proposed inference: \"If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane\". This statement is saying that if Erin took a train, it is not possible for Sam to have taken a plane. \n\nNotice that these two statements are actually contrapositives of each other. The contrapositive of a statement \"If A, then not B\" is \"If B, then not A\". In this case, the original statement is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin did not take a train\", and its contrapositive is indeed \"If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane\". \n\nSince the contrapositive of a true statement is also true, we can infer that the proposed statement is indeed true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
