            "content": "Explanation: Let's analyze the given statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was not awake\". This statement implies a conditional relationship between the vampire's wakefulness and the mummy's wakefulness. Specifically, it states that if the vampire is awake, the mummy cannot be awake.\n\nTo determine if we can infer the converse statement, \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake\", we need to examine the logical structure of the original statement. The original statement can be represented as:\n\nV \u2192 \u00acM\n\nwhere V represents \"the vampire is awake\" and M represents \"the mummy is awake\". The arrow (\u2192) denotes implication, and \u00ac denotes negation.\n\nNow, let's consider the converse statement: \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake\". This statement can be represented as:\n\nM \u2192 \u00acV\n\nTo determine if we can infer this statement from the original one, we need to check if the original statement logically implies the converse statement. In other words, we need to check if V \u2192 \u00acM implies M \u2192 \u00acV.\n\nUpon closer inspection, we can see that the original statement and the converse statement are actually logically equivalent. This is because the implication \"V \u2192 \u00acM\" is equivalent to \"M \u2192 \u00acV\" (this is known as the contrapositive form).\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer the converse statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
