However, statement 2 only guarantees that if the splat is morphed, then it is quanked. It does not provide any information about the converse, i.e., if the splat is quanked, then it must be morphed.\n\nIn other words, there could be other reasons why the splat is quanked, unrelated to being morphed. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the splat was morphed solely based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
