This is consistent with statement 1.\n* If the wug was not flooped, statement 2 does not provide any information about whether the wug bimmed the zoint or not. However, statement 1 still asserts that the wug bimmed the zoint.\n\nIn neither scenario can we conclude that the wug was flooped based on the given statements. The fact that the wug bimmed the zoint does not necessarily imply that it was flooped.\n\nAnswer: no",
