We also know that if the flugel is blimmed, then it must be zargled (from statement 2). However, this does not necessarily mean that the flugel is blimmed. There could be other reasons why the flugel is zargled, unrelated to being blimmed.\n\nIn other words, the fact that the flugel is zargled does not provide enough information to conclude that it is blimmed. We need more information to establish a direct connection between being blimmed and being zargled.\n\nAnswer: no",
