It implies that if the fribble was snurgled, then it would crink.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nWe know the fribble crinked (from statement 1). The conditional statement (2) tells us that if the fribble was snurgled, it would crink. Since we know the fribble did crink, it's possible that it was snurgled, but we can't be certain. There might be other reasons why the fribble crinked.\n\nAnswer: no",
