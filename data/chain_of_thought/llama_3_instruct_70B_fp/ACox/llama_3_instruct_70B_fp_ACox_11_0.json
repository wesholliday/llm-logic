We also know that if the flug is blummed, then it must be zimmed (from statement 2). However, this does not necessarily mean that the flug is blummed. There could be other reasons why the flug is zimmed, unrelated to being blummed.\n\nTo infer that the flug is blummed, we would need additional information that guarantees the flug's zimmedness is solely due to its blummedness. Without such information, we cannot conclude that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: no",
