It means that if the sprocket is cranked, it will necessarily be daggled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nWe know the sprocket is daggled (from statement 1). We also know that if the sprocket is cranked, it will be daggled (from statement 2). However, this does not necessarily mean that the sprocket was cranked. There could be other reasons why the sprocket is daggled, unrelated to it being cranked.\n\nAnswer: no",
