    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the stock market, real estate market, and bond market are the primary investment vehicles. According to financial advisors, the stock market likely will see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns. These markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn\u2019t have the highest returns, then if stocks don\u2019t, bonds will. Moreover, stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if stocks don\u2019t have the highest returns, bonds will?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given information step by step. \n\nFirst, we know that the stock market is expected to have the highest returns, followed by real estate, and then bonds. This means that stocks > real estate > bonds in terms of expected returns.\n\nNext, we are told that if real estate doesn't have the highest returns, then if stocks don't, bonds will. This can be rewritten as: if real estate \u2260 highest, then if stocks \u2260 highest, bonds = highest. Since we know that stocks are expected to have the highest returns, this statement is equivalent to saying that if real estate \u2260 highest, then bonds = highest.\n\nNow, we are also told that stocks likely will have the highest returns, and hence real estate likely won't. This is consistent with our initial information.\n\nThe question asks whether it follows that if stocks don't have the highest returns, bonds will. \n\nAnswer: no",
