    "user_prompt": "Suppose that banana bread, chocolate chip cookies, and carrot cake are the most popular baked goods. According to a consumer survey, it is very likely that banana bread will be the top seller, followed closely by chocolate chip cookies, with carrot cake far behind. These are the only top sellers, so if chocolate chip cookies aren\u2019t the top seller, then if banana bread isn\u2019t, carrot cake will be. Moreover, it is likely banana bread will be top and hence that chocolate chip cookies won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if banana bread isn\u2019t the top seller, carrot cake will be?",

Chocolate chip cookies are likely to be the second-best seller.\n3. Carrot cake is far behind in popularity.\n4. If chocolate chip cookies aren't the top seller, then if banana bread isn't, carrot cake will be. This implies that if banana bread isn't the top seller, carrot cake will be the top seller only if chocolate chip cookies aren't the top seller either.\n5. It is likely that banana bread will be the top seller, and hence it is likely that chocolate chip cookies won't be.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: \"Does it follow that it is likely that, if banana bread isn't the top seller, carrot cake will be?\"\n\nIf banana bread isn't the top seller, it means that either chocolate chip cookies or carrot cake will be the top seller. But we know that chocolate chip cookies are more popular than carrot cake, so it's more likely that chocolate chip cookies will be the top seller if banana bread isn't.\n\nAnswer: no",
