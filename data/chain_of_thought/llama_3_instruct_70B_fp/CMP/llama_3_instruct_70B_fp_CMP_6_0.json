    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, and Beyonce have the top-selling albums this year. Industry experts project it's likely Taylor Swift's album will sell the most copies, followed closely by Bad Bunny's, with Beyonce's album far behind. These are the only top-sellers, so if Bad Bunny\u2019s album doesn\u2019t sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift\u2019s doesn\u2019t, Beyonce\u2019s will. Moreover, Taylor Swift\u2019s likely will sell the most and hence Bad Bunny's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given information step by step. \n\nFirst, we know that Taylor Swift's album is likely to sell the most copies, followed closely by Bad Bunny's. This implies that Bad Bunny's album is more likely to sell the most copies than Beyonce's. \n\nNext, we are told that if Bad Bunny's album doesn't sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift's doesn't, Beyonce's will. This can be rewritten as: if Bad Bunny's album doesn't sell the most copies and Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, then Beyonce's will. \n\nWe are also given that Taylor Swift's album is likely to sell the most copies, which means it's unlikely that Taylor Swift's album won't sell the most copies. \n\nNow, let's consider the question: is it likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will? \n\nIf Taylor Swift's album doesn't sell the most copies, then it's possible that Bad Bunny's album might sell the most copies. But we know that Bad Bunny's album is unlikely to sell the most copies because Taylor Swift's album is likely to sell the most copies. \n\nSo, if Taylor Swift's album doesn't sell the most copies, it's still unlikely that Bad Bunny's album will sell the most copies. \n\nAccording to the given information, if Bad Bunny's album doesn't sell the most copies and Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, then Beyonce's will. \n\nSince we have established that if Taylor Swift's album doesn't sell the most copies, it's still unlikely that Bad Bunny's album will sell the most copies, we can conclude that if Taylor Swift's album doesn't sell the most copies, it's likely that Beyonce's will. \n\nAnswer: yes",
