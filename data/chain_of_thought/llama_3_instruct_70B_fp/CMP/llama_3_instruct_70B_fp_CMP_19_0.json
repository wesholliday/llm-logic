    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don\u2019t increase the most, then if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won\u2019t increase the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given information step by step. \n\nWe know that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase, and economists project that rents will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising the least. \n\nWe are also given that if home prices don't increase the most, then if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. This implies that if home prices don't increase the most, then rents must increase the most, otherwise mortgage rates will increase the most. \n\nFurthermore, we are told that rents likely will increase the most, which means home prices likely won't increase the most. \n\nNow, let's consider the question: Does it follow that it's likely that, if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most? \n\nIf rents don't increase the most, then either home prices or mortgage rates must increase the most. But we know that home prices likely won't increase the most (since rents likely will increase the most), so it's likely that mortgage rates will increase the most if rents don't increase the most. \n\nAnswer: yes",
