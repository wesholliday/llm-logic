    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given information step by step. \n\nFirst, we know that Tennessee is expected to add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, and then Missouri's growth is significantly lower. This implies that the order of job growth is Tennessee > Georgia > Missouri.\n\nNext, we are given the conditional statement: \"if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will.\" This can be rewritten as: \"if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs and Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then Missouri will.\" Since Tennessee is expected to add the most jobs, the condition \"Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs\" implies that Georgia must be the one adding the most jobs (since Georgia is the next in line after Tennessee). But this contradicts the condition \"Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs\". Therefore, the only way this conditional statement can be true is if the antecedent \"Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs and Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs\" is false, which means Tennessee must add the most jobs.\n\nWe are also given that \"Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t.\" This reinforces the idea that Tennessee is expected to add the most jobs, and Georgia is not.\n\nNow, the question asks whether it follows that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will. If Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then Georgia must add the most jobs (since Georgia is the next in line after Tennessee). But we know that Georgia is not expected to add the most jobs, so this scenario is unlikely. Therefore, it's unlikely that if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will.\n\nAnswer: no",
