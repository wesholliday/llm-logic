    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it\u2019s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be. Moreover, it\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given information step by step. \n\nFirst, we know that apples are likely to be the top-selling fruit, followed closely by bananas, and oranges are trailing distantly behind. This implies that apples are the most likely to be the top seller, and bananas are the second most likely.\n\nNext, we are told that if bananas aren't the top seller, then if apples aren't, oranges will be. This can be rewritten as: if bananas aren't the top seller and apples aren't the top seller, then oranges will be the top seller.\n\nFinally, we are told that it's likely apples will be top and hence bananas won't be. This means that the probability of apples being the top seller is high, and as a result, the probability of bananas being the top seller is low.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren't the top-selling fruit, oranges will be? \n\nIf apples aren't the top-selling fruit, then bananas or oranges must be. But we know that bananas are unlikely to be the top seller (since apples are likely to be top and hence bananas won't be). Therefore, if apples aren't the top seller, it is likely that oranges will be.\n\nAnswer: yes",
