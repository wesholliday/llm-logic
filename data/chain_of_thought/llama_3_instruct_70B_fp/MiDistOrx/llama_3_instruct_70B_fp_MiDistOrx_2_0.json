            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence \"The wibble might be on the zizz or in the snizzle\" is a disjunction, which means it presents two alternative possibilities. The phrase \"might be\" is a modal verb phrase that indicates possibility, and it applies to both alternatives. \n\nIn the proposed inference, \"The wibble might be on the zizz or it might be in the snizzle\", the modal verb phrase \"might be\" is repeated for each alternative, making the sentence more explicit about the possibility of each option. \n\nSince the original sentence already implies that both alternatives are possible, the proposed inference is a reasonable expansion of the original sentence, making the possibilities more explicit.\n\nAnswer: yes",
