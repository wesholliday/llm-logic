There is no mention of \"wump\" in the original statement. \n\nThe proposed inference adds \"wump\" to the original statement, which is not supported by the original statement. \n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \"The plonk might wump and crunk\" from the original statement \"The plonk might crunk\".\n\nAnswer: no",
