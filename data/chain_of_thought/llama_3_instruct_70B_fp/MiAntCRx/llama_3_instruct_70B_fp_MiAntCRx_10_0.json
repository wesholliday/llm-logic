However, the original statement only mentions the possibility of the snork being plimp, without providing any information about the possibility of it being zibble.\n\nSince the original statement does not provide any information about the snork being zibble, we cannot infer that the snork might be both zibble and plimp solely based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
