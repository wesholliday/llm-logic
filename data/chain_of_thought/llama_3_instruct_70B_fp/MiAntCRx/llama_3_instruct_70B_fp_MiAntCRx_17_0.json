However, the original statement only mentions the possibility of the glorp being bimboozle, but it does not provide any information about the possibility of the glorp being shimble.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the glorp might be shimble and bimboozle solely based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
