However, the original statement only mentions the possibility of the blimple being quank, without providing any information about the property of being frozz.\n\nSince the original statement does not provide any information about the property of being frozz, we cannot infer that the blimple might be both frozz and quank based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
