There is no mention of \"quibble\" in the original statement. \n\nThe proposed inference adds \"quibble\" to the possible actions of \"The zazzle\", which is not supported by the original statement. \n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \"The zazzle might quibble and fizzle\" from the original statement \"The zazzle might fizzle\".\n\nAnswer: no",
