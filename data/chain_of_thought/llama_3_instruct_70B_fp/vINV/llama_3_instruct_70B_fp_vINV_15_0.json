            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise states \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\", which can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin took a train\".\n\nThe conclusion states \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train\", which can be represented as \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\", where \u00acP is \"Sam did not take a plane\" and \u00acQ is \"Erin did not take a train\".\n\nA logically valid argument is one where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise(s). In this case, we need to determine if \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ follows necessarily from P \u2192 Q.\n\nOne way to approach this is to consider the contrapositive of the premise, which is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. This states that if Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane. Now, if we assume \u00acP (Sam did not take a plane), we can infer \u00acQ (Erin did not take a train) using the contrapositive. This means that the conclusion \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ does follow necessarily from the premise P \u2192 Q.\n\nAnswer: yes",
