            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This implies that Mary's presence at the wedding is a sufficient condition for Sue's presence.\n\nThe conclusion, on the other hand, states that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding. This implies that Mary's absence from the wedding is a sufficient condition for Sue's absence.\n\nHowever, the premise does not provide any information about what happens when Mary is not at the wedding. It only tells us what happens when Mary is at the wedding. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nIn other words, the premise only guarantees Sue's presence when Mary is present, but it does not guarantee Sue's absence when Mary is absent. There might be other reasons why Sue was at the wedding, even if Mary was not.\n\nAnswer: no",
