            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be represented as \"R \u2192 Y\", where R represents \"the apple was red\" and Y represents \"the banana was yellow\".\n\nThe conclusion is also a conditional statement: \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acR \u2192 \u00acY\", where \u00acR represents \"the apple was not red\" and \u00acY represents \"the banana was not yellow\".\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In other words, we need to check if \u00acR \u2192 \u00acY can be deduced from R \u2192 Y.\n\nOne way to approach this is to use the contrapositive of the premise, which is \u00acY \u2192 \u00acR. This states that if the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red. Now, we can see that the conclusion \u00acR \u2192 \u00acY is not equivalent to the contrapositive \u00acY \u2192 \u00acR. In fact, they are converse statements, which are not necessarily equivalent.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
