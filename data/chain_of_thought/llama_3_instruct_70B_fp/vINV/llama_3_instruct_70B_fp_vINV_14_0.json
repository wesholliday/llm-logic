            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise states \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\", which can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q is \"the wolf was in the den\".\n\nThe conclusion states \"If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den\", which can be represented as \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\", where \u00acP is \"the bear was not in the cave\" and \u00acQ is \"the wolf was not in the den\".\n\nA logically valid argument is one where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise(s). In this case, we need to determine if \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ follows necessarily from P \u2192 Q.\n\nNotice that the premise P \u2192 Q does not provide any information about what happens when the bear is not in the cave (\u00acP). It only tells us that if the bear is in the cave (P), then the wolf is in the den (Q). It does not guarantee that if the bear is not in the cave (\u00acP), then the wolf is not in the den (\u00acQ).\n\nIn fact, it's possible for the wolf to be in the den even if the bear is not in the cave. The premise does not rule out this possibility. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\n\nAnswer: no",
