            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument. The premise is a conditional statement: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\" This can be represented as \"A \u2192 R\", where \"A\" represents \"the alien visited Mars\" and \"R\" represents \"the robot visited Jupiter\".\n\nThe conclusion is also a conditional statement: \"If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acA \u2192 \u00acR\", where \"\u00ac\" denotes negation.\n\nA logically valid argument is one where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise(s). In this case, we need to determine if \u00acA \u2192 \u00acR follows necessarily from A \u2192 R.\n\nOne way to approach this is to consider the contrapositive of the premise, which is \u00acR \u2192 \u00acA. This is logically equivalent to the original premise A \u2192 R. Now, we can see that the conclusion \u00acA \u2192 \u00acR is the same as the contrapositive of the premise.\n\nThis means that the conclusion does follow necessarily from the premise, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
