            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q,\" where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThe conclusion is also a conditional statement: \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ,\" where \u00acP is \"Tom did not watch football\" and \u00acQ is \"Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n\nA logically valid argument is one where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise(s). In this case, we need to determine if \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ follows necessarily from P \u2192 Q.\n\nTo do this, let's consider the possible truth values of P and Q:\n\n1. P is true (Tom watched football), and Q is true (Jen watched basketball). The premise P \u2192 Q is true.\n2. P is true, and Q is false (Jen did not watch basketball). The premise P \u2192 Q is false.\n3. P is false, and Q is true. The premise P \u2192 Q is true.\n4. P is false, and Q is false. The premise P \u2192 Q is true.\n\nNow, let's examine the conclusion \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ:\n\n1. P is false, and Q is false. The conclusion \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ is true.\n2. P is false, and Q is true. The conclusion \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ is false.\n3. P is true, and Q is true. The conclusion \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ is false.\n4. P is true, and Q is false. The conclusion \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ is false.\n\nAs we can see, the conclusion \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ does not follow necessarily from the premise P \u2192 Q. In scenarios 2, 3, and 4, the premise is true, but the conclusion is false. This means that the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
