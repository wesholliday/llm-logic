            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the premise and conclusion. The premise states \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\", which can be represented as \"If J, then M\" (where J represents \"the book was written by James\" and M represents \"the book is a mystery novel\").\n\nThe conclusion states \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel\", which can be represented as \"If not J, then not M\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument. If the premise is true, it means that if James wrote the book, it must be a mystery novel. However, the conclusion is trying to infer that if James did not write the book, then it cannot be a mystery novel. This is not necessarily true. There could be other authors who write mystery novels.\n\nIn fact, the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, which is not necessarily equivalent. The contrapositive of \"If J, then M\" is \"If not M, then not J\", not \"If not J, then not M\".\n\nAnswer: no",
