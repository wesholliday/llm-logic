            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q,\" where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nThe conclusion is also a conditional statement: \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ,\" where \u00acP is \"Jeff did not play basketball\" and \u00acQ is \"Amy did not play tennis.\"\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In other words, we need to check if \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ can be deduced from P \u2192 Q.\n\nOne way to approach this is to use the contrapositive of the premise, which is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. This states that if Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball. Now, we can see that the conclusion \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ is equivalent to the contrapositive \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. This means that the conclusion is actually a restatement of the premise in a different form.\n\nAnswer: yes",
