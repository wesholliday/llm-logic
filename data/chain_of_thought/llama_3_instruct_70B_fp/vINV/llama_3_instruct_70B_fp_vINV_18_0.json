            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 M\", where P represents \"the doll was plastic\" and M represents \"the truck was metal\".\n\nThe conclusion is also a conditional statement: \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acM\", where \u00acP represents \"the doll was not plastic\" and \u00acM represents \"the truck was not metal\".\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, we can use the rule of contraposition, which states that \"P \u2192 M\" is equivalent to \"\u00acM \u2192 \u00acP\". This means that if the premise \"P \u2192 M\" is true, then the statement \"\u00acM \u2192 \u00acP\" must also be true.\n\nNow, let's examine the conclusion \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acM\". This is the contrapositive of the premise \"P \u2192 M\", but with the antecedent and consequent reversed. Since the contrapositive of a true statement is also true, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
