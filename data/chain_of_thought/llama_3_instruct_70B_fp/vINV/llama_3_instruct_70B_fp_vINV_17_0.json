            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q,\" where P is \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q is \"Kate ate salad.\"\n\nThe conclusion is also a conditional statement: \"If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ,\" where \u00acP is \"Ben did not eat pasta\" and \u00acQ is \"Kate did not eat salad.\"\n\nA logically valid argument is one where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise(s). In this case, we need to determine if \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ follows necessarily from P \u2192 Q.\n\nTo do this, we can use a technique called \"modus tollens.\" Modus tollens is a valid argument form that states: \"If P \u2192 Q, and \u00acQ, then \u00acP.\" In our case, we can apply modus tollens as follows:\n\n1. P \u2192 Q (premise)\n2. \u00acQ ( assumption, for the sake of argument)\n3. \u00acP (conclusion, by modus tollens)\n\nNow, let's compare this with the original conclusion: \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ. We can see that the assumption \u00acQ in step 2 is not actually given in the original argument. Therefore, we cannot conclude \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ solely based on the premise P \u2192 Q.\n\nIn other words, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
