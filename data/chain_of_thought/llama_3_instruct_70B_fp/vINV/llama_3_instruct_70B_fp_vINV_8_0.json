            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This implies a conditional relationship between the vampire's state and the mummy's state.\n\nThe conclusion, on the other hand, states that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake. This conclusion is essentially the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"if A, then B\" is \"if not B, then not A\". In this case, the contrapositive of the premise would be \"if the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake\".\n\nHowever, the conclusion is not exactly the contrapositive of the premise. Instead, it's a statement that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake. This is not necessarily true based on the premise alone. The premise only guarantees that if the vampire is awake, the mummy is awake, but it does not provide any information about what happens when the vampire is not awake.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise, and the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
