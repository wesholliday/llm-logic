            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise states \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\", which can be represented as \"C \u2192 D\" (where C represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and D represents \"the pants were denim\").\n\nThe conclusion states \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim\", which can be represented as \"\u00acC \u2192 \u00acD\" (where \u00acC represents \"the shirt was not cotton\" and \u00acD represents \"the pants were not denim\").\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, we can use the rule of contrapositive, which states that \"C \u2192 D\" is equivalent to \"\u00acD \u2192 \u00acC\". \n\nApplying this rule to the premise \"C \u2192 D\", we get \"\u00acD \u2192 \u00acC\", which is equivalent to \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\". This is not the same as the conclusion \"\u00acC \u2192 \u00acD\", which states \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim\".\n\nSince the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
