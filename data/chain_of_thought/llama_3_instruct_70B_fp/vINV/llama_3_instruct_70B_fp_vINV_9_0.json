            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument. The premise is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\".\n\nThe conclusion is also a conditional statement: \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\", where \u00acP is \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" and \u00acQ is \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\".\n\nA logically valid argument is one where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise(s). In this case, we need to determine if \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ follows necessarily from P \u2192 Q.\n\nTo do this, we can use a technique called \"contraposition\". Contraposition states that if P \u2192 Q is true, then \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP is also true. In other words, if \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true, then \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" is also true.\n\nNow, we can see that the conclusion \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ is equivalent to \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, which is the contrapositive of the premise P \u2192 Q. Therefore, the conclusion does follow necessarily from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
