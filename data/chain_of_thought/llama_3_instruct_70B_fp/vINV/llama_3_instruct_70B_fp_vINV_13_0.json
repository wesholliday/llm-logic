            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise states \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\", which can be represented as \"R \u2192 B\" (where R represents \"the car was red\" and B represents \"the truck was blue\").\n\nThe conclusion states \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\", which can be represented as \"\u00acR \u2192 \u00acB\" (where \u00acR represents \"the car was not red\" and \u00acB represents \"the truck was not blue\").\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In other words, we need to check if \u00acR \u2192 \u00acB can be deduced from R \u2192 B.\n\nOne way to approach this is to use the contrapositive of the premise, which is \u00acB \u2192 \u00acR. This states that if the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\n\nNow, if we assume \u00acR (the car was not red), we can use the contrapositive to conclude \u00acB (the truck was not blue). This means that the conclusion \u00acR \u2192 \u00acB does follow logically from the premise R \u2192 B.\n\nAnswer: yes",
