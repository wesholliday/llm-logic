This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that one of them must be true and the other must be false.\n\nNext, we are told that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch. This statement does not provide any definitive information, but it does suggest that the possibility of the remote control hiding under the couch is not certain.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. If the remote control is not hiding under the couch, then according to the first statement, it must be on the coffee table. However, if the remote control might not be hiding under the couch, it does not necessarily mean that it is not hiding under the couch. There is still a possibility that it is hiding under the couch.\n\nAnswer: no",
