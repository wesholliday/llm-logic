We know that either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk, which means these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. This can be represented as a logical OR statement: Pen in bag OR Pen on desk.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the pen might not be on my desk. This implies that there is a possibility that the pen is not on my desk. If the pen is not on my desk, then according to the first statement, it must be in my bag.\n\nHowever, the fact that the pen might not be on my desk does not guarantee that it is not on my desk. There is still a possibility that the pen is on my desk. Therefore, we cannot conclude with absolute certainty that the pen is in my bag.\n\nAnswer: no",
