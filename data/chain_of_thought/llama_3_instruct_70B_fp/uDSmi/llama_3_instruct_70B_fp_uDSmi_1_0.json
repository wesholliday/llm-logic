Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\nThis statement implies that there are only two possible locations for Fido: inside or in the garden.\n\n2. Fido might not be in the garden.\nThis statement tells us that it's possible that Fido is not in the garden.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Fido might not be in the garden, then the only other possible location for Fido is inside (according to statement 1). However, statement 2 only tells us that Fido might not be in the garden, but it doesn't guarantee that Fido is not in the garden. There's still a possibility that Fido is indeed in the garden.\n\nAnswer: no",
