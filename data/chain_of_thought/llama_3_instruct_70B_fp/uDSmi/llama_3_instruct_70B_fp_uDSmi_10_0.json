This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that the missing sock can only be in one of these two places.\n\nWe are also told that the missing sock might not be under the bed. This statement does not provide any new information about the laundry basket, but it does give us a hint about the possibility of the sock being under the bed. Since it might not be under the bed, it's possible that it is not under the bed.\n\nNow, let's combine the two pieces of information. If the missing sock is not under the bed (which is a possibility), then it must be in the laundry basket, because these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.\n\nAnswer: yes",
