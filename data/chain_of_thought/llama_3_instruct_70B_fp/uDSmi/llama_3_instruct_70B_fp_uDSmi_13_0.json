This implies that these are the only two possible locations for the toy. \n\nThen, we are told that the toy might not be sitting on the shelf. This does not mean that the toy is definitely not on the shelf, but rather that it is possible that it is not on the shelf. \n\nNow, let's consider the two possible locations for the toy. If the toy is not on the shelf, then it must be in the toy box, since these are the only two possible locations. However, we are not certain that the toy is not on the shelf, so we cannot conclude with absolute certainty that the toy is in the toy box. \n\nAnswer: no",
