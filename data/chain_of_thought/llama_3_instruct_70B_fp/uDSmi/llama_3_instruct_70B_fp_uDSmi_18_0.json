This implies that these are the only two possible locations for the notebook. \n\nThen, we are told that the notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand. This does not necessarily mean that the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand, but rather that we cannot be certain that it is. \n\nHowever, since we know that the notebook must be in one of the two locations, and we are not certain that it is on the nightstand, it is possible that the notebook is in the drawer. \n\nBut, we cannot infer with absolute certainty that the notebook is in the drawer, because we are only told that it might not be on the nightstand, not that it is definitely not on the nightstand.\n\nAnswer: no",
