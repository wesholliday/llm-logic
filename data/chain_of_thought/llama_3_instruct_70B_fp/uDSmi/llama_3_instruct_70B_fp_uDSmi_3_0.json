This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that one of them must be true and the other must be false. \n\nWe are also told that the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet. This implies that it is possible that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet. \n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities. If the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, then according to the first statement, they must be in the drawer. However, if the keys are dangling in the cabinet, then they are not in the drawer. \n\nBut we are not certain that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet. It's just a possibility. Therefore, we cannot conclude with absolute certainty that the keys are in the drawer. \n\nAnswer: no",
