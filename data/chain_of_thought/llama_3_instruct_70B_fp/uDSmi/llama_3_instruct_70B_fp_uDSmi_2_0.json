Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\nThis statement implies that there are only two possible locations for the book: the shelf or the table.\n\n2. The book might not be resting on the table.\nThis statement introduces uncertainty about the book's location on the table. It doesn't rule out the possibility that the book is on the table, but it suggests that it's not a certainty.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the book is not on the shelf, then according to statement 1, it must be resting on the table. However, statement 2 introduces doubt about the book being on the table. This means that we can't be certain about the book's location on the table.\n\nSince we can't be certain about the book being on the table, and there are only two possible locations (shelf or table), we can infer that the book might be on the shelf. However, we can't conclude with absolute certainty that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: no",
