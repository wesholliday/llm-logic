This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that one of them must be true and the other must be false.\n\nWe are also told that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head. This statement does not provide any definitive information, but it does suggest that the possibility of the sunglasses being perched on her head is not certain.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. If the sunglasses are not perched on her head, then according to the first statement, they must be in her bag. However, if the sunglasses are perched on her head, then they are not in her bag. Since we are not certain about the sunglasses being perched on her head, we cannot conclude with absolute certainty that they are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: no",
