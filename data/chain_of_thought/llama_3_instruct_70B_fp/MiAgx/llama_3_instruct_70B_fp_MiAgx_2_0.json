            "content": "Explanation: The given sentence \"The frazzle might be on the zump and the gribble might wozzle a frazzle grooble\" contains two clauses: \"The frazzle might be on the zump\" and \"the gribble might wozzle a frazzle grooble\". Both clauses have the modal verb \"might\", which indicates possibility. \n\nThe sentence \"It might be that the frazzle is on the zump and the gribble wozzles a frazzle grooble\" is a rephrased version of the original sentence. It combines the two clauses into a single sentence using the phrase \"It might be that\", which also indicates possibility. \n\nThe main difference between the two sentences is the word order and the use of the phrase \"It might be that\". However, the meaning and the possibility expressed by both sentences are the same. \n\nAnswer: yes",
