            "content": "Explanation: To determine if an argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, we have a conditional statement as the first premise: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\". This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo\".\n\nThe second premise is \"Joe did not go to the park\", which can be represented as \"\u00acP\". From this, we can infer that the antecedent of the conditional statement is false.\n\nNow, we need to examine if we can logically conclude that Lucy did not go to the zoo (\u00acQ) from the given premises. Since the antecedent P is false, the conditional statement \"P \u2192 Q\" does not provide any information about the truth value of Q. In other words, if the condition \"Joe went to the park\" is not met, we cannot infer anything about Lucy going to the zoo.\n\nHowever, in this case, we can use the principle of modus tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement \"P \u2192 Q\" and we know that P is false, then we can conclude that Q \u2192 \u00acP. Applying this principle, we get \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\", which means \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\". Since we know that Joe did not go to the park (\u00acP), we can indeed conclude that Lucy did not go to the zoo (\u00acQ).\n\nAnswer: yes",
