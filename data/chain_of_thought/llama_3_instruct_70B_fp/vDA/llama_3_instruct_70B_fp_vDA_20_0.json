            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\". This can be represented as \"R \u2192 Y\", where R represents \"the apple was red\" and Y represents \"the banana was yellow\".\n\nThe second premise is a negation of the antecedent: \"The apple was not red\", which can be represented as \"\u00acR\".\n\nThe conclusion is a negation of the consequent: \"The banana was not yellow\", which can be represented as \"\u00acY\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\n1. If R \u2192 Y (first premise)\n2. \u00acR (second premise)\n3. \u2234 \u00acY (conclusion)\n\nThe question is, does \u00acY necessarily follow from the premises?\n\nIn this case, the answer is yes. If the apple was not red (\u00acR), and we know that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow (R \u2192 Y), then we can conclude that the banana was not yellow (\u00acY). This is because the conditional statement R \u2192 Y implies that if R is false, then Y must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
