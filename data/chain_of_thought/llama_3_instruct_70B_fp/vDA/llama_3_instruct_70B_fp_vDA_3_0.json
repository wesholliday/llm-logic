            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as \"If A, then B\" or \"A \u2192 B\".\n\nThe second premise is a negation of the antecedent: \"The book was not written by James.\" This can be represented as \"Not A\" or \"\u00acA\".\n\nThe conclusion is a negation of the consequent: \"The book is not a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as \"Not B\" or \"\u00acB\".\n\nNow, let's examine the argument:\n\n1. If A, then B (If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel)\n2. Not A (The book was not written by James)\n3. \u2234 Not B (The book is not a mystery novel)\n\nThis argument form is not logically valid. The conclusion \"Not B\" does not necessarily follow from the premises. Just because the book was not written by James, it does not mean it's not a mystery novel. There could be other authors who write mystery novels.\n\nAnswer: no",
