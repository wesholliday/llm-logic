            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\". This can be represented as \"M \u2192 S\", where M represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S represents \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n\nThe second premise is a negation: \"Mary was not at the wedding\", which can be represented as \"\u00acM\".\n\nThe conclusion is also a negation: \"Sue was not at the wedding\", which can be represented as \"\u00acS\".\n\nNow, let's see if we can derive the conclusion from the premises. From the first premise, we know that if M is true, then S must also be true. But the second premise tells us that M is actually false (\u00acM). This means that the conditional statement \"M \u2192 S\" does not provide any information about S, since its antecedent (M) is false.\n\nHowever, we can use the fact that M is false to conclude that the conditional statement \"M \u2192 S\" is actually true, since the antecedent is false. This is a fundamental property of material implication.\n\nNow, we can use this fact to conclude that if M \u2192 S is true, and M is false, then S must also be false. This is because if S were true, then the conditional statement \"M \u2192 S\" would be false, since M is false but S is true.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid, since the conclusion \u00acS follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
