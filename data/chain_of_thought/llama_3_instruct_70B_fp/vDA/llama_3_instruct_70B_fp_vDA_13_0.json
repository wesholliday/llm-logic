            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\". This can be represented as \"R \u2192 B\", where R represents \"the car was red\" and B represents \"the truck was blue\".\n\nThe second premise is a negation: \"The car was not red\", which can be represented as \"\u00acR\".\n\nThe conclusion is also a negation: \"The truck was not blue\", which can be represented as \"\u00acB\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\n1. If R \u2192 B (first premise)\n2. \u00acR (second premise)\n3. \u2234 \u00acB (conclusion)\n\nWe can see that the argument is using a form of modus tollens, which is a valid inference rule. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement \"A \u2192 B\" and we know that \"\u00acA\", we can conclude \"\u00acB\".\n\nIn this case, we have \"R \u2192 B\" and \"\u00acR\", so we can apply modus tollens to conclude \"\u00acB\", which is the desired conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
