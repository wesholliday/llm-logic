            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be represented as \"V \u2192 M\", where V represents \"the vampire was awake\" and M represents \"the mummy was awake\".\n\nThe second premise is a negation: \"The vampire was not awake.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acV\", where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\nThe conclusion is also a negation: \"The mummy was not awake.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acM\".\n\nNow, let's see if we can derive the conclusion from the premises. From the first premise, we know that if V is true, then M must also be true. But the second premise tells us that V is not true (\u00acV). Therefore, we cannot conclude that M is true, but we also cannot conclude that M is false. However, since V is not true, the conditional statement \"V \u2192 M\" does not provide any information about M.\n\nBut wait, we can use the fact that V \u2192 M is equivalent to \u00acV \u2228 M (this is a well-known logical equivalence). So, we have \u00acV \u2228 M, and we know that \u00acV is true. Therefore, we can conclude that \u00acM must be true, because if \u00acM were false, then M would be true, and \u00acV \u2228 M would be true, but we know that \u00acV is true, so \u00acM must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
