            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\".\n\nThe second premise is a negation of the antecedent: \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\", which can be represented as \"\u00acP\".\n\nThe conclusion is a negation of the consequent: \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\", which can be represented as \"\u00acQ\".\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. If P \u2192 Q is true, and \u00acP is true, then we can infer that Q might be true or false, but we can't conclude that \u00acQ is true. In other words, if Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, it doesn't necessarily mean that Mark didn't buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
