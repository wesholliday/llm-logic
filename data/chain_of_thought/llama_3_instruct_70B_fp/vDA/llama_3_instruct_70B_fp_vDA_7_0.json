            "content": "Explanation: To determine if an argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, we have a conditional statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" (let's denote it as A\u2192C), and a negation of the antecedent \"Alex did not finish the race\" (\u00acA). We need to see if we can logically deduce the conclusion \"Chris did not finish the race\" (\u00acC) from these premises.\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. However, the second premise tells us that Alex did not finish the race. This means that the condition for Chris to finish the race (Alex finishing the race) is not met. Therefore, we can conclude that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nThis form of argument is a classic example of modus tollens, which is a valid argument form. The structure of the argument is:\n\nA\u2192C\n\u00acA\n\u2234 \u00acC\n\nModus tollens is a valid argument form because it follows the rules of propositional logic. If the antecedent (A) is false, and the conditional statement (A\u2192C) is true, then we can logically conclude that the consequent (C) must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
