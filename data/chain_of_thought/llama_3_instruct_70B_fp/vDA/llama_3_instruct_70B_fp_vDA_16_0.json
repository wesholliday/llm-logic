            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\". This can be represented as \"C \u2192 D\", where C represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and D represents \"the pants were denim\".\n\nThe second premise is a negation of the antecedent: \"The shirt was not cotton\", which can be represented as \"\u00acC\".\n\nThe conclusion is a negation of the consequent: \"The pants were not denim\", which can be represented as \"\u00acD\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\n1. If C \u2192 D is true, and C is false (\u00acC), we cannot conclude that D is false (\u00acD). There are other possibilities, such as D being true or false independently of C.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario where the shirt is not cotton (\u00acC), but the pants are denim (D). This would not contradict the first premise, as the premise only states that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim, but it doesn't say anything about what happens when the shirt is not cotton.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The pants were not denim\" does not follow necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
