            "content": "Explanation: To determine if an argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. Let's analyze the given argument:\n\nPremise 1: If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta (If P, then Q)\nPremise 2: Sue did not choose pizza (Not P)\nConclusion: Bob did not choose pasta (Not Q)\n\nWe can use a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and its contrapositive (If Not Q, then Not P) to evaluate the argument. The contrapositive of \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\".\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion follows from the premises:\n\n1. Sue did not choose pizza (Given)\n2. If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza (Contrapositive of Premise 1)\n3. Since Sue did not choose pizza, we can conclude that Bob did not choose pasta (Modus tollens, a valid inference rule)\n\nThe conclusion indeed follows logically from the premises. If Sue didn't choose pizza, and if she had chosen pizza, Bob would have chosen pasta, then it's reasonable to conclude that Bob didn't choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
