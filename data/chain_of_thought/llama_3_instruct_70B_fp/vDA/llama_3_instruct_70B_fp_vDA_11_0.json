            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\". This can be represented as \"C \u2192 B\", where C represents \"the cake was chocolate\" and B represents \"the muffins were blueberry\".\n\nThe second premise is a negation of the antecedent: \"The cake was not chocolate\", which can be represented as \"\u00acC\".\n\nThe conclusion is a negation of the consequent: \"The muffins were not blueberry\", which can be represented as \"\u00acB\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\n1. If C \u2192 B (first premise)\n2. \u00acC (second premise)\n3. \u2234 \u00acB (conclusion)\n\nThis argument form is known as modus tollens, which is a valid argument form. The conclusion \u00acB follows necessarily from the premises C \u2192 B and \u00acC.\n\nAnswer: yes",
