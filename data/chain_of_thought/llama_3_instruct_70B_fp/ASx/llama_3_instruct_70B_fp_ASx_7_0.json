            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If the tizzer is on, then the goom is snurpled.\" This implies a causal relationship between the tizzer being on and the goom being snurpled. In other words, if the tizzer is on, it guarantees that the goom is snurpled.\n\nNow, let's consider the new statement: \"If the tizzer is on and the plink light is out, then the goom is snurpled.\" We can analyze this statement by asking ourselves: Does the additional condition \"the plink light is out\" change the relationship between the tizzer being on and the goom being snurpled?\n\nThe answer is no. The original statement only cares about the tizzer being on, and it doesn't mention the plink light at all. Therefore, the additional condition \"the plink light is out\" doesn't affect the conclusion that the goom is snurpled.\n\nIn other words, if the tizzer being on is enough to guarantee that the goom is snurpled, then it doesn't matter what the plink light is doing. The goom will still be snurpled as long as the tizzer is on.\n\nAnswer: yes",
