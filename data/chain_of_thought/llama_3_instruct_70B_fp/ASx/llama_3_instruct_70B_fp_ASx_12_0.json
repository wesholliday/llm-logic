This implies that brinling the splotch is a sufficient condition for the bloop to floosh. \n\nThe new statement is \"If you bringle the splotch and the crungle is splooted, then the bloop will floosh\". This statement adds an additional condition, \"the crungle is splooted\", to the original condition \"you bringle the splotch\". \n\nSince the original statement only requires \"you bringle the splotch\" for the bloop to floosh, adding an additional condition cannot make the statement false. If brinling the splotch is enough to make the bloop floosh, then brinling the splotch and the crungle being splooted will also make the bloop floosh. \n\nAnswer: yes",
