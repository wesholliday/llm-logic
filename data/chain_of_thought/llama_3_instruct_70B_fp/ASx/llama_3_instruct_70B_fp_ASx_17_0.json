Since the original statement only depends on \"the glop is on the brink\" to conclude \"the skrizzle is plonked,\" the additional condition \"the bloop is zorped\" does not change the relationship between \"the glop is on the brink\" and \"the skrizzle is plonked.\" \n\nIn other words, as long as \"the glop is on the brink\" is true, the original statement guarantees that \"the skrizzle is plonked,\" regardless of the value of \"the bloop is zorped.\" \n\nAnswer: yes",
