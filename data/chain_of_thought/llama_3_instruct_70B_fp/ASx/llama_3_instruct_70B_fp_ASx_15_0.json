However, the original statement only guarantees the floinking of the blip if the glunk snarbles, without mentioning anything about the troon.\n\nSince the original statement doesn't provide any information about the troon, we can't infer that the additional condition of the troon being zibbled would affect the outcome. The original statement still holds true, and the floinking of the blip would still occur if the glunk snarbles, regardless of the state of the troon.\n\nAnswer: yes",
