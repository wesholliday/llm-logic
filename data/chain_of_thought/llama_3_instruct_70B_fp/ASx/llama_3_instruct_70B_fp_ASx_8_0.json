Morphing is still present, and we know that morphing is enough to guarantee tizzling. \n\nThe additional condition \"it was misglommed\" might be relevant in some other context, but it does not affect the relationship between morphing and tizzling. \n\nTherefore, we can conclude that if the plink has morphed, it will tizzle, regardless of whether it was misglommed or not.\n\nAnswer: yes",
