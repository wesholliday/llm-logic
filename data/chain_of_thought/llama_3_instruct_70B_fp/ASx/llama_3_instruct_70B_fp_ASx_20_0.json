Since the original statement only depends on \"the plim is grobbled,\" the addition of \"the drazzle is drooped\" does not change the relationship between \"the plim is grobbled\" and \"the whiffle will sploosh.\" \n\nIn other words, if the plim being grobbled is enough to guarantee the whiffle will sploosh, then it will still sploosh even if the drazzle is also drooped. \n\nAnswer: yes",
