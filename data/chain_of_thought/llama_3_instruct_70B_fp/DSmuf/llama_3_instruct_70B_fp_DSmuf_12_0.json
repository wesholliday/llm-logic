It says that either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair. This implies that one of these two options must be true.\n\nThe second statement negates the first option, saying that it's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet. This means that the first option is false.\n\nNow, let's go back to the disjunction. Since one of the options must be true, and the first option is false, the only remaining option is that the jacket is draped over the chair. This is the only possibility left, so we can infer that it must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
