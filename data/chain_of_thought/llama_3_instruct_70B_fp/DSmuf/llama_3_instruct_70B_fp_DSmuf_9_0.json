The first statement is a disjunction, which means it presents two possibilities: either the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor or it is in the box. This statement does not give us any information about which option is true, but it tells us that one of them must be true.\n\nThe second statement negates the first possibility, saying that it's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor. This means we can eliminate the first option, leaving us with only one possibility: the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nSince the first statement presented two mutually exclusive options, and we've eliminated one of them, we are left with the other option as the only remaining possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
