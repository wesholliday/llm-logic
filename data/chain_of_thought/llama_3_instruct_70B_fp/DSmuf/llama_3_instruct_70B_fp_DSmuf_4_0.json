It says that either the cat must be playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch. This implies that one of these two options must be true.\n\nThe second statement negates the first option, saying it's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom. This means we can eliminate the first option, leaving us with only one possibility: the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nSince the original disjunction stated that one of the two options must be true, and we've eliminated the first option, we are left with the conclusion that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
