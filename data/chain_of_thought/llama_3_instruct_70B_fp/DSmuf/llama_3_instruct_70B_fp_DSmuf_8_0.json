It says that either the remote control is hiding under the couch or it's on the coffee table. This implies that one of these two options must be true.\n\nThe second statement is a negation of the first disjunct, which means it's saying that the remote control is not hiding under the couch. This means that the first option in the disjunction is eliminated, leaving only one possibility: the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nSince the disjunction guarantees that one of the options is true, and the first option is eliminated, we are left with the second option, which is that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
