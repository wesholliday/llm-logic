The first statement is \"Either the missing sock must be under the bed or it's in the laundry basket.\" This is an \"or\" statement, which means that one or both of the options must be true. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\" This statement is negating the first option, implying that the missing sock cannot be under the bed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. If the missing sock cannot be under the bed, and we know that it must be either under the bed or in the laundry basket, then the only remaining option is that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
