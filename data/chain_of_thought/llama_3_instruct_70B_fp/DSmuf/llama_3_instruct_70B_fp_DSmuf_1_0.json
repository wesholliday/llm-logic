            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside\" - This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two options must be true. It can be represented as \"A or B\", where A = \"Fido must be in the garden\" and B = \"Fido is inside\".\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" - This statement negates the first option, A. It can be represented as \"not A\".\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of inference:\n\nSince \"not A\" is true, and we know that \"A or B\" is true, we can conclude that B must be true. This is because if A were true, then \"not A\" would be false, which contradicts the given statement. Therefore, B, which is \"Fido is inside\", must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
