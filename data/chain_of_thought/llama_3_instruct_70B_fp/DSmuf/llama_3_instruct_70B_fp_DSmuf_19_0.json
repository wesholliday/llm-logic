It says that either the watch is on his wrist or it's charging on the dresser. This implies that these are the only two possible scenarios.\n\nThe second statement negates the first option, saying it's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist. This means we can rule out the possibility that the watch is on his wrist.\n\nSince the first statement presents two mutually exclusive options, and we've eliminated one of them, we're left with only one remaining possibility: the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
