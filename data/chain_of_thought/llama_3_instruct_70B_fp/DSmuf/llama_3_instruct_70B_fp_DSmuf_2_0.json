            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. The first statement is \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf\". This is a classic \"or\" statement, which means that one or both of the conditions must be true. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\". This statement is negating the first part of the \"or\" statement, which means that the book cannot be resting on the table.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. If the book cannot be resting on the table, and the original statement says that it's either on the table or on the shelf, then the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf. This is because the \"or\" statement implies that one of the conditions must be true, and since the table option is ruled out, the shelf option must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
