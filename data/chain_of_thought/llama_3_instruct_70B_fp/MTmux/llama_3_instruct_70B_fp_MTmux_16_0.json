            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the sneg was crampled\" and B is \"the sneg must have sproted the frink\".\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink\" - This statement can be represented as \"Not B\", which negates the conclusion of the conditional statement.\n\nNow, let's apply modus tollens, a rule of inference that states: \"If A implies B, and not B, then not A\". In this case, if \"the sneg was crampled\" (A) implies \"the sneg must have sproted the frink\" (B), and it's not the case that \"the sneg must have sproted the frink\" (not B), then we can conclude that \"the sneg was not crampled\" (not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
