            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"F \u2192 S\", where F represents \"the clug was fleeked\" and S represents \"the clug must have been snugged\".\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged\" - This statement can be represented as \"\u00acS\", where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The clug was not fleeked\", which can be represented as \"\u00acF\".\n\nUsing modus tollens, a valid inference rule, we can conclude:\n\nIf F \u2192 S and \u00acS, then \u00acF.\n\nIn our case, we have F \u2192 S (given statement 1) and \u00acS (given statement 2). Therefore, we can apply modus tollens to infer \u00acF, which means \"The clug was not fleeked\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
