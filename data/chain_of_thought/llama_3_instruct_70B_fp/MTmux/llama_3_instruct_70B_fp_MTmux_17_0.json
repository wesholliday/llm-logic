(If P, then Q)\n2. It's not the case that the flob must have movated. (~Q)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The flob was not skizzled\" (~P).\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Q is false. Now, let's examine statement 1. If P implies Q, and Q is false, then we can conclude that P must also be false. This is because if P were true, then Q would have to be true (by modus ponens), but we know Q is false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that P (the flob was skizzled) is false, which means the flob was not skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
