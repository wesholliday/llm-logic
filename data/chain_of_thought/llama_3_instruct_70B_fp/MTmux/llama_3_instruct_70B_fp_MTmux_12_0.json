If the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint.\nThis can be represented as a conditional statement: \"Shripped \u2192 Lupped\" (if shripped, then lupped).\n\n2. It's not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint.\nThis can be represented as a negation: \"\u00acLupped\" (not lupped).\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"The smip was not shripped\" from these two statements.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the smip did not lup the zoint. Using modus tollens, a rule of inference, we can conclude that if \"Shripped \u2192 Lupped\" and \"\u00acLupped\", then \"\u00acShripped\" (not shripped).\n\nAnswer: yes",
