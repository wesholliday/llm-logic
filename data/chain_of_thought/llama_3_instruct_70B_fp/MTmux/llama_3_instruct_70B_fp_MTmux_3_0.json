            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"M \u2192 Q\", where M stands for \"the splat was morphed\" and Q stands for \"the splat must have quanked\".\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the splat must have quanked\" - This statement can be represented as \"\u00acQ\", where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"The splat was not morphed\" (\u00acM) from the given statements.\n\nSince we have \u00acQ, and we know that M \u2192 Q, we can apply modus tollens, which is a rule of inference that states: if M \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acM.\n\nIn this case, we have M \u2192 Q (given) and \u00acQ (given), so we can conclude \u00acM, which means \"The splat was not morphed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
