If the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint.\n2. It's not the case that the wug must have bimmed the zoint.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the wug was flooped, then it necessarily implies that the wug must have bimmed the zoint. This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"the wug was flooped\" and the consequent is \"the wug must have bimmed the zoint\".\n\nNow, let's look at statement 2, which negates the consequent of statement 1. It says that it's not the case that the wug must have bimmed the zoint. This means that the consequent of statement 1 is false.\n\nUsing modus tollens, a rule of inference, we can conclude that if the consequent is false, and there's a conditional statement connecting the antecedent to the consequent, then the antecedent must also be false. In this case, the antecedent is \"the wug was flooped\".\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the wug was not flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
