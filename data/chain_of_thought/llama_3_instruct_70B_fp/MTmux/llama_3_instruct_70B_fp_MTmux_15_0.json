            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"V \u2192 S\", where V represents \"the dreb was vroombed\" and S represents \"the dreb must have been spened\".\n2. \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been spened\" - This statement can be represented as \"\u00acS\", where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The dreb was not vroombed\", which can be represented as \"\u00acV\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if V is true, then S must also be true. However, the second statement tells us that S is actually false (\u00acS). This means that the condition \"V \u2192 S\" cannot be true when S is false. Therefore, we can conclude that V must also be false, because if V were true, it would imply S, which is not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
