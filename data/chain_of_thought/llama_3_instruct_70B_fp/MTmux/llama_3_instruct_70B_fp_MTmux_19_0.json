If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged.\n2. It's not the case that the smonk must have plagged.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the smonk did not plag. Now, let's examine statement 1. It's a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\n\nIf A (the smonk was vreebled), then B (the smonk must have plagged)\n\nSince we know that B is false (from statement 2), we can conclude that A must also be false. This is because if A were true, then B would necessarily be true, but we know that B is not true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
