            "content": "Explanation: To determine if an argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. Let's analyze the given argument:\n\nPremise 1: If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta (If P, then Q)\nPremise 2: Bob did not choose pasta (~Q)\nConclusion: Sue did not choose pizza (~P)\n\nWe can use a simple logical rule called modus tollens to evaluate this argument. Modus tollens states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"not Q\", we can conclude \"not P\".\n\nIn this case, we have \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" (If P, then Q) and \"Bob did not choose pasta\" (~Q). Applying modus tollens, we can conclude \"Sue did not choose pizza\" (~P), which is the given conclusion.\n\nSince the conclusion follows logically and necessarily from the premises, we can conclude that the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
