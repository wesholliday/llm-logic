            "content": "Explanation: To determine if an argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, we have a conditional statement as the first premise: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\". This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q is \"Kate ate salad\". The second premise is the negation of Q, which is \"\u00acQ\" or \"Kate did not eat salad\". \n\nFrom the first premise, we know that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, the second premise tells us that Q is actually false. Therefore, we can conclude that P must also be false, because if P were true, then Q would have to be true, but we know that Q is false. This is a classic example of a logically valid argument form, known as modus tollens.\n\nAnswer: yes",
