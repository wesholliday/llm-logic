            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be represented as \"V \u2192 M\", where \"V\" represents \"the vampire was awake\" and \"M\" represents \"the mummy was awake\".\n\nThe second premise is a negation: \"The mummy was not awake.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acM\", where \"\u00ac\" represents negation.\n\nThe conclusion is also a negation: \"The vampire was not awake.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acV\".\n\nNow, let's see if we can derive the conclusion from the premises. From the first premise, we know that if V is true, then M must also be true. But the second premise tells us that M is false (\u00acM). Therefore, we can conclude that V must also be false, because if V were true, M would be true, but we know M is false. This is a valid inference, known as modus tollens.\n\nAnswer: yes",
