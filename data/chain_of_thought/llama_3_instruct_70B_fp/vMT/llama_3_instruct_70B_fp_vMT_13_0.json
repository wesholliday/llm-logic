            "content": "Explanation: To determine if an argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, we have a conditional statement as the first premise: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\". This can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue\".\n\nThe second premise is \"The truck was not blue\", which can be represented as \"not Q\". From this, we can infer that if Q is false, then the antecedent P must also be false, because if P were true, then Q would be true (by the first premise). But since Q is false, P cannot be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
