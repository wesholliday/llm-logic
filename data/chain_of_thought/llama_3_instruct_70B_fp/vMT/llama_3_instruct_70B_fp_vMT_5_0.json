            "content": "Explanation: To determine if an argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, we have a conditional statement as the first premise: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\". This can be represented as \"J \u2192 A\", where \"J\" stands for \"Jeff played basketball\" and \"A\" stands for \"Amy played tennis\".\n\nThe second premise is \"Amy did not play tennis\", which can be represented as \"\u00acA\" (not A).\n\nWe need to see if we can logically deduce the conclusion \"Jeff did not play basketball\" (\u00acJ) from the premises.\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that if Jeff played basketball (J), then Amy played tennis (A). But the second premise tells us that Amy did not play tennis (\u00acA). This means that the condition \"A\" is not true. Since the conditional statement \"J \u2192 A\" implies that if J is true, then A must also be true, but A is not true, we can conclude that J must not be true either. Therefore, Jeff did not play basketball (\u00acJ).\n\nAnswer: yes",
