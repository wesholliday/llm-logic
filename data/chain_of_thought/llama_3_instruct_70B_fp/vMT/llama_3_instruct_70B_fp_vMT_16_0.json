            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\". This can be represented as \"C \u2192 D\", where \"C\" represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and \"D\" represents \"the pants were denim\".\n\nThe second premise is a negation: \"The pants were not denim\", which can be represented as \"\u00acD\".\n\nThe conclusion is also a negation: \"The shirt was not cotton\", which can be represented as \"\u00acC\".\n\nNow, let's see if we can derive the conclusion from the premises. From the first premise, we know that if C is true, then D must be true. But the second premise tells us that D is false (\u00acD). Therefore, we can conclude that C must be false, because if C were true, then D would be true, but we know D is false. This means that \u00acC follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
