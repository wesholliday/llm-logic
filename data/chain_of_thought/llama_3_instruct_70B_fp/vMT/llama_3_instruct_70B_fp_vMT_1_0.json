            "content": "Explanation: To determine if an argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, we have a conditional statement as the first premise: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" (If P, then Q). The second premise is a negation of the consequent: \"Sue was not at the wedding\" (~Q). \n\nFrom the first premise, we know that if Mary was at the wedding (P), then Sue must have been at the wedding (Q). But the second premise tells us that Sue was not at the wedding (~Q). This means that the condition \"If Mary was at the wedding\" (P) cannot be true, because if it were, then Sue would have been at the wedding, which contradicts the second premise. Therefore, we can conclude that Mary was not at the wedding (~P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
