            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\". This can be represented as \"C \u2192 B\", where \"C\" represents \"the cake was chocolate\" and \"B\" represents \"the muffins were blueberry\".\n\nThe second premise is a negation: \"The muffins were not blueberry\", which can be represented as \"\u00acB\".\n\nThe conclusion is also a negation: \"The cake was not chocolate\", which can be represented as \"\u00acC\".\n\nNow, let's see if we can derive the conclusion from the premises. From the first premise, we know that if C is true, then B must be true. But the second premise tells us that B is false (\u00acB). Therefore, we can conclude that C must be false (\u00acC), because if C were true, then B would be true, but we know that B is false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
