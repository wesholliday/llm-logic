            "content": "Explanation: To determine if an argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. Let's analyze the given argument:\n\nPremise 1: If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo (p \u2192 q)\nPremise 2: Lucy did not go to the zoo (\u00acq)\nConclusion: Joe did not go to the park (\u00acp)\n\nWe can use a logical rule called modus tollens to evaluate this argument. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement \"if p, then q\" and we know that q is false, we can conclude that p must also be false.\n\nIn this case, we have \"if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" (p \u2192 q), and we know that Lucy did not go to the zoo (\u00acq). Applying modus tollens, we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park (\u00acp).\n\nAnswer: yes",
