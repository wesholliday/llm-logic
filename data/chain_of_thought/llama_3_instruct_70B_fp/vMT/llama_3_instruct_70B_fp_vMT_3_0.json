            "content": "Explanation: To determine if an argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, the argument has the following form:\n\nIf P, then Q\nNot Q\nTherefore, Not P\n\nThis is a classic form of argument known as modus tollens. It is a valid form of argument because if P implies Q, and Q is not true, then we can conclude that P must not be true either. In other words, if the book being written by James implies that it is a mystery novel, and it is not a mystery novel, then it must not have been written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
