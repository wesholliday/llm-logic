            "content": "Explanation: To determine if an argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, we have a conditional statement as the first premise: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\". This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball\".\n\nThe second premise is the negation of Q: \"Jen did not watch basketball\", which can be represented as \"\u00acQ\".\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that if P is true, then Q must also be true. But the second premise tells us that Q is actually false. Therefore, we can conclude that P must also be false, because if P were true, Q would have to be true, but we know Q is false.\n\nThis form of argument is a classic example of modus tollens, which is a valid argument form. It has the following structure:\n\nP \u2192 Q\n\u00acQ\n\u2234 \u00acP\n\nAnswer: yes",
