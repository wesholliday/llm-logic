            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\". This can be represented as \"R \u2192 Y\", where R represents \"the apple was red\" and Y represents \"the banana was yellow\".\n\nThe second premise is a negation: \"The banana was not yellow\", which can be represented as \"\u00acY\".\n\nThe conclusion is also a negation: \"The apple was not red\", which can be represented as \"\u00acR\".\n\nNow, let's see if we can derive the conclusion from the premises. From the first premise, we know that if R is true, then Y must also be true. But the second premise tells us that Y is false (\u00acY). Therefore, we can conclude that R must also be false, because if R were true, Y would be true, but we know Y is false. This means that the conclusion \u00acR follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
