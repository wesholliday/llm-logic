            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"the dog was inside\" and Q is \"the cat was outside\".\n\nThe second premise is a negation of the consequent: \"The cat was not outside\", which can be represented as \"\u00acQ\".\n\nThe conclusion is a negation of the antecedent: \"The dog was not inside\", which can be represented as \"\u00acP\".\n\nNow, let's see if we can derive the conclusion from the premises. From the first premise, we know that if P is true, then Q must be true. But the second premise tells us that Q is not true. Therefore, we can conclude that P must not be true, because if P were true, Q would have to be true, but Q is not true.\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus tollens, which is a valid argument form. It has the following structure:\n\nP \u2192 Q\n\u00acQ\n\u2234 \u00acP\n\nSince the argument follows a valid form, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
