            "content": "Explanation: To determine if an argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, we have a conditional statement as the first premise: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe second premise is the negation of Q: \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt,\" which can be represented as \"\u00acQ.\"\n\nFrom these two premises, we can apply the rule of modus tollens, which states that if P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP. In this case, if \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true, and \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" is true, then we can conclude that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
