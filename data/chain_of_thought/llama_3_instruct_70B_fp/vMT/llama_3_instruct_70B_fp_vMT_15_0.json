            "content": "Explanation: To determine if an argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. Let's analyze the given argument:\n\nPremise 1: If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train (p \u2192 q)\nPremise 2: Erin did not take a train (\u00acq)\nConclusion: Sam did not take a plane (\u00acp)\n\nWe can use a logical rule called modus tollens to evaluate this argument. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (p \u2192 q) and we know that q is false (\u00acq), then we can conclude that p must be false (\u00acp).\n\nIn this case, we have the conditional statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" (p \u2192 q), and we know that \"Erin did not take a train\" (\u00acq). Applying modus tollens, we can conclude that \"Sam did not take a plane\" (\u00acp).\n\nAnswer: yes",
