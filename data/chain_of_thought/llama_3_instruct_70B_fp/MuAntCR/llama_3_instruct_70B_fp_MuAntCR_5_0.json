            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package must have been signed for\" implies that the package was received and someone signed for it. However, it does not provide any information about the specific day it was delivered. The phrase \"must have been\" indicates a conclusion based on some evidence, but it does not specify when the delivery took place.\n\nThe added clause \"delivered yesterday\" is not logically implied by the original statement. There is no connection between the fact that the package was signed for and the specific day it was delivered. It could have been delivered yesterday, today, or any other day.\n\nAnswer: no",
