It does not provide any information about the time of the meeting. The inferred statement \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM and in the conference room\" adds new information about the time of the meeting, which is 2 PM. This information is not present in the original statement, and we cannot logically conclude the time of the meeting from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
