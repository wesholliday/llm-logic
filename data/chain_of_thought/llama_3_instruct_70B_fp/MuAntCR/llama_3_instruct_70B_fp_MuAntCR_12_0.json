It does not mention anything about the completion date of the project. The added clause \"been completed by Friday\" introduces new information that is not present in the original statement. \n\nWe cannot logically conclude that the project was completed by Friday just because it was under budget. There might be other factors that contributed to the project being under budget, such as efficient resource allocation or reduced scope, but we cannot infer a specific completion date from this information alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
