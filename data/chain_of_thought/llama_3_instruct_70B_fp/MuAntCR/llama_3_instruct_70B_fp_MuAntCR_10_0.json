            "content": "Explanation: To infer 'The document must have been signed and notarized' from 'The document must have been notarized', we need to examine the relationship between notarization and signing. Notarization is a process that typically occurs after a document has been signed, as it involves a notary public verifying the identity of the signer and witnessing their signature. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that if a document must have been notarized, it must have been signed beforehand. This is because notarization is a subsequent step that builds upon the existence of a signature.\n\nAnswer: yes",
