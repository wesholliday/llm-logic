It does not provide any information about the accuracy of the report. The phrase \"must have been\" is used to express obligation or necessity, but it only applies to the submission of the report by noon, not to its accuracy.\n\nThe added clause \"and been accurate\" is not implied by the original statement. To infer that the report must have been accurate, we would need additional information or context that is not provided in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
