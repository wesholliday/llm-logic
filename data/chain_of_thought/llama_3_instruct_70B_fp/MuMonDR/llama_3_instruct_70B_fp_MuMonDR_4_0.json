It does not provide any information about the meeting being cancelled. \n\nThe inferred statement \"The meeting must have been cancelled or scheduled for 2 PM\" is trying to introduce a new possibility that the meeting was cancelled, which is not present in the original statement. \n\nHowever, since the original statement does confirm that the meeting was scheduled for 2 PM, we can say that the meeting was either scheduled for 2 PM (which is confirmed) or cancelled (which is not confirmed but possible). \n\nAnswer: yes",
