            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The application must have been completed online\" implies that the application was completed through an online platform. This statement does not provide any information about the possibility of completing the application in person. However, if we consider the alternative \"The application must have been completed in person or online\", it includes the original statement as a subset. In other words, if the application must have been completed online, it is also true that it must have been completed either in person or online, since online is one of the options.\n\nAnswer: yes",
