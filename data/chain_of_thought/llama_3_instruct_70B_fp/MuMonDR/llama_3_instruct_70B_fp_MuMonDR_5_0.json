If we consider the statement \"The package must have been delivered tomorrow or today\", it includes the possibility of the package being delivered today, which is already confirmed by the original statement. Additionally, it also includes the possibility of the package being delivered tomorrow, which is not contradicted by the original statement. Therefore, the original statement is a subset of the possibilities presented in the new statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
