            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The room must have been cleaned daily\" implies that the room was cleaned every day, without any exceptions. If we add the condition \"upon request\" to the original statement, it would mean that the room was cleaned either every day or when someone requested it to be cleaned. This additional condition does not contradict the original statement, but rather provides an alternative scenario under which the room was cleaned.\n\nIn other words, if the room was cleaned daily, it is possible that it was also cleaned upon request, as daily cleaning would satisfy the request. Therefore, we can infer that the room was cleaned upon request or daily, as the original statement is a subset of the new statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
