However, the original statement doesn't provide any information about the library being a possible location for the book. It only mentions the shelf.\n\nSince the original statement doesn't imply that the book could be in the library, we can't infer that the book must be in the library or on the shelf. The original statement is more restrictive, only allowing for the shelf as a possible location.\n\nAnswer: no",
