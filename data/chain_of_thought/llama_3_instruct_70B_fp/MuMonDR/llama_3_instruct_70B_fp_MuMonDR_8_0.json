            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays\" implies that the restaurant was not open on Mondays. The inferred statement \"The restaurant must have been open for limited hours or closed on Mondays\" is a broader statement that includes the possibility of the restaurant being closed on Mondays, but also allows for the possibility of it being open for limited hours. \n\nSince the original statement is a subset of the inferred statement, we can conclude that the inferred statement is true if the original statement is true. In other words, if the restaurant was indeed closed on Mondays, then it must have been open for limited hours or closed on Mondays.\n\nAnswer: yes",
