            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday\" implies that the project was required to be finished by Friday, and it's likely that it was completed on or before that day. The added phrase \"or extended\" changes the meaning of the sentence, as it introduces the possibility that the project's deadline might have been pushed back beyond Friday. \n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide any information about the possibility of an extension. It only focuses on the completion of the project by Friday. Therefore, we cannot infer the possibility of an extension from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
