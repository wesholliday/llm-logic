The addition of \"or subtitled\" in the inferred statement is not necessarily implied by the original statement, as it introduces a new possibility that was not mentioned initially. However, since the original statement does imply that the movie was in English, it is true that the movie must have been either subtitled or in English, as \"in English\" is one of the possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes",
