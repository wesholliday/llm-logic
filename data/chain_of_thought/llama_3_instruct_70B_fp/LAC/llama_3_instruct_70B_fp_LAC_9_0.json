            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\".\n2. \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" - This is a statement that affirms Q.\n\nTo infer \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" (P), we need to examine the relationship between P and Q. The first statement implies that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, it does not guarantee that P is true if Q is true. In other words, the conditional statement only provides a one-way implication.\n\nIn this case, we are given that Q is true (Mark bought the blue shirt), but we cannot logically conclude that P must be true (Lisa bought the red shirt) solely based on this information. There might be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt, unrelated to Lisa buying the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
