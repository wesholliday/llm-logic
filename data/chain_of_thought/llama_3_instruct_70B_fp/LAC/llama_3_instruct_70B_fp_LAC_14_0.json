However, this does not necessarily mean that if W is true, then B must also be true. There could be other reasons why W is true, unrelated to B.\n\nIn this case, we are given that W is true, but we cannot logically conclude that B must be true. There is not enough information to establish a direct connection between W and B.\n\nAnswer: no",
