            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Mary \u2192 Sue\". It means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding too.\n2. \"Sue was at the wedding\" - This is a simple statement, which can be represented as \"Sue\".\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can logically infer \"Mary was at the wedding\" from these two statements. To do this, we can use the rules of inference.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding too. But statement 2 tells us that Sue was indeed at the wedding. However, this does not necessarily mean that Mary was at the wedding. There could be other reasons why Sue was at the wedding, unrelated to Mary's presence.\n\nIn other words, the fact that Sue was at the wedding does not provide enough information to conclude that Mary was at the wedding. We can only conclude that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would have been at the wedding too, but we cannot infer the converse.\n\nAnswer: no",
