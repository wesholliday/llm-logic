            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" which can be represented as \"P \u2192 M\" where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and M is \"the truck was metal\". We are also given that \"The truck was metal\" which is M.\n\nTo infer \"The doll was plastic\" (P), we need to examine the conditional statement. The conditional statement only guarantees that if P is true, then M must be true. However, it does not guarantee that if M is true, then P must be true. In other words, the conditional statement only provides a one-way implication.\n\nIn this case, we are given that M is true, but we cannot conclude that P must be true. There might be other reasons why M is true, and P might be false.\n\nAnswer: no",
