We have a conditional statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" which can be represented as \"Ben ate pasta \u2192 Kate ate salad\". We also know that \"Kate ate salad\" is true. \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can logically infer \"Ben ate pasta\" from these two statements. \n\nThe conditional statement \"Ben ate pasta \u2192 Kate ate salad\" only guarantees that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if Kate ate salad. \n\nIn other words, just because Kate ate salad, it does not necessarily mean that Ben ate pasta. There could be other reasons why Kate ate salad, unrelated to Ben eating pasta. \n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \"Ben ate pasta\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
