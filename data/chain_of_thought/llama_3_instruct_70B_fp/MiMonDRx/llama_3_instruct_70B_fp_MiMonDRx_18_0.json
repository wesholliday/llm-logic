This statement is saying that the snizzle might be either glorp or zazzle.\n\nSince the original statement already implies that the snizzle might be zazzle, adding the possibility of it being glorp as well does not contradict the original statement. In fact, it's a broader statement that includes the original possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
