This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the fizzle is glorp.\n\nThe proposed inference is 'The fizzle might be shimble or glorp'. This statement suggests that there are two possibilities: the fizzle might be shimble, or the fizzle might be glorp.\n\nSince the original statement already implies that the fizzle might be glorp, and the proposed inference includes this possibility, we can conclude that the proposed inference is a broader statement that encompasses the original statement.\n\nIn other words, if the fizzle might be glorp, then it is also true that the fizzle might be shimble or glorp, because the latter includes the possibility of the fizzle being glorp.\n\nAnswer: yes",
