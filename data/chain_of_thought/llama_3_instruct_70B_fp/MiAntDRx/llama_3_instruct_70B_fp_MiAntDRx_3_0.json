The use of \"or\" suggests that these are alternative possibilities, and it's not necessary for the fribble to be in both locations simultaneously. \n\nSince one of the possibilities is that the fribble is on the wumble, we can conclude that it's possible for the fribble to be on the wumble.\n\nAnswer: yes",
