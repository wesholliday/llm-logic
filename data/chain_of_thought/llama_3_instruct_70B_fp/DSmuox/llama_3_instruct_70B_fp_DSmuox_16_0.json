In other words, it's possible that the sneg doesn't have to be sproted.\n\n2. \"Either the sneg is crampled or it must be sproted\" - This statement presents two alternatives: the sneg is crampled, or it must be sproted. Since we know from statement 1 that it's not the case that the sneg must be sproted, we can eliminate the second alternative. This leaves us with the first alternative: the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
