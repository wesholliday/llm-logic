In other words, it's possible that the glip doesn't have to be tragged.\n\n2. \"Either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged\" - This statement presents two possibilities: either the glip is slogged, or it must be tragged. \n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. Since the first statement negates the idea that the glip must be tragged, we can focus on the other possibility presented in the second statement, which is that the glip is slogged. \n\nIf the glip must not be tragged (from statement 1), and it's either slogged or must be tragged (from statement 2), then the only remaining possibility is that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
