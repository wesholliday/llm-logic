In other words, it's possible that the flug doesn't have to be zimmed.\n\n2. \"Either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed\" - This statement presents two alternatives: the flug is blummed, or it must be zimmed. Since we know from statement 1 that it's not the case that the flug must be zimmed, we can eliminate the second alternative.\n\nBy process of elimination, we are left with the first alternative: the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
