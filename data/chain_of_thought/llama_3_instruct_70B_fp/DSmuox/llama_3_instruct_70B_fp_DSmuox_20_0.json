In general, a disjunction is true if at least one of the disjuncts is true.\n\nNow, let's combine the two statements. Since the fleeg does not have to be surned (from statement 1), the second disjunct \"it must be surned\" in statement 2 is false. For the disjunction in statement 2 to be true, the first disjunct \"the fleeg is bluttered\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
