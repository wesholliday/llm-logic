In other words, it's possible that the smip doesn't have to be lupped.\n\n2. \"Either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped\" - This statement presents two alternatives: either the smip is shripped, or it must be lupped. \n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. If it's not the case that the smip must be lupped (from statement 1), then the only remaining option from statement 2 is that the smip is shripped. This is because the \"or\" in statement 2 is an inclusive or, meaning that if one option is false, the other must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
