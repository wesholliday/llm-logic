In other words, it's possible that the dreb doesn't have to be spened.\n\n2. \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened\" - This statement presents two alternatives: either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened. \n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. Since the first statement negates the idea that the dreb must be spened, we can conclude that the only remaining option from the second statement is that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
