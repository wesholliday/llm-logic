In other words, it's possible that the twonk doesn't need to be plinked.\n\n2. \"Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked\" - This statement presents two alternatives: the twonk is varnished, or it must be plinked. Since the first statement negates the idea that the twonk must be plinked, we can conclude that the only remaining option is that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
