In other words, it's possible that the clug doesn't have to be snugged.\n\n2. \"Either the clug is fleeked or it must be snugged\" - This statement presents two possibilities: either the clug is fleeked, or it must be snugged. \n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. If it's not the case that the clug must be snugged (from statement 1), then the only remaining possibility from statement 2 is that the clug is fleeked. \n\nAnswer: yes",
