In other words, it's possible that the wug doesn't need to be bimmed.\n\n2. \"Either the wug is flooped or it must be bimmed\" - This statement presents two alternatives: either the wug is flooped, or it must be bimmed. \n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. Since the first statement negates the idea that the wug must be bimmed, we can conclude that the second alternative in the second statement is false. Therefore, the first alternative in the second statement must be true, which is \"the wug is flooped\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
