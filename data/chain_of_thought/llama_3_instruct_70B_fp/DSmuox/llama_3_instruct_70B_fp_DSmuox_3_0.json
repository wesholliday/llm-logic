In other words, it's possible that the splat doesn't need to be quanked.\n\n2. \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked\" - This statement presents two possibilities: the splat is morphed, or it must be quanked. \n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. If it's not the case that the splat must be quanked (from statement 1), then the only remaining possibility from statement 2 is that the splat is morphed. \n\nAnswer: yes",
