In other words, it's possible that the shank doesn't have to be nugged.\n\n2. \"Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged\" - This statement presents two possibilities: the shank is plooked, or it must be nugged. Since we know from statement 1 that it's not necessary for the shank to be nugged, the only remaining possibility is that the shank is plooked.\n\nBy combining these two statements, we can conclude that the shank is plooked, as it's the only option left.\n\nAnswer: yes",
