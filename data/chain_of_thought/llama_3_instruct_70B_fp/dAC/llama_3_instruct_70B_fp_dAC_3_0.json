            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the book was written by James\" and B is \"the book is a mystery novel\".\n2. \"The book is a mystery novel\" - This is a statement that affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nTo deduce \"The book was written by James\" (A), we need to ensure that the only possible way for the book to be a mystery novel (B) is if it was written by James (A). However, the given statements do not provide enough information to make this conclusion.\n\nThe first statement only guarantees that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. It does not rule out the possibility that other authors could have written mystery novels as well. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the book was written by James solely based on the fact that it is a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: no",
