It means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding too.\n2. \"Sue was at the wedding\" - This is a simple statement, which confirms that Sue was indeed at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nWe know that Sue was at the wedding, but the first statement only guarantees that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would be at the wedding too. It does not provide any information about Mary's presence at the wedding if Sue is already at the wedding.\n\nIn other words, the first statement is a one-way implication, and it does not allow us to conclude the presence of Mary at the wedding solely based on Sue's presence.\n\nAnswer: no",
