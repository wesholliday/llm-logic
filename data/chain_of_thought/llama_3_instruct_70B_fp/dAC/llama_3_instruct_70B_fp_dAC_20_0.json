            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow\".\n2. \"The banana was yellow\" - This is a statement that affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nTo deduce \"The apple was red\" (A), we need to determine if the truth of B implies the truth of A. However, the conditional statement only guarantees that if A is true, then B is true (A \u2192 B). It does not guarantee that if B is true, then A is true (B \u2192 A).\n\nIn other words, just because the banana was yellow, it does not necessarily mean that the apple was red. There could be other reasons why the banana was yellow, unrelated to the color of the apple.\n\nAnswer: no",
