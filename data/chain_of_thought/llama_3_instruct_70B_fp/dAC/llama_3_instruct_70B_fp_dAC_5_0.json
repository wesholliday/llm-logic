            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"J \u2192 A\", where J represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and A represents \"Amy played tennis\".\n2. \"Amy played tennis\" - This is a simple statement, which can be represented as \"A\".\n\nWe want to deduce whether \"Jeff played basketball\" (J) follows from these two statements. To do this, we can use the rules of inference.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that A is true. Now, we can use the Modus Ponens rule, which states that if we have \"J \u2192 A\" and \"A\", we can conclude \"J\". However, in this case, we don't have \"J \u2192 A\" exactly; we have \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\", which is equivalent to \"J \u2192 A\".\n\nSince we have \"A\" (Amy played tennis) and \"J \u2192 A\" (if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis), we can apply the Modus Ponens rule to conclude \"J\" (Jeff played basketball).\n\nAnswer: yes",
