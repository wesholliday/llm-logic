            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" which can be represented as \"If P, then M\" where P represents \"the doll was plastic\" and M represents \"the truck was metal\". We are also given that \"The truck was metal\" which is M.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can deduce \"The doll was plastic\" (P) from the given statements. To do this, we can use a technique called modus ponens. Modus ponens states that if we have \"If P, then M\" and we know M is true, then we can conclude P is true. However, in this case, we only have \"If P, then M\" and M, but we don't have a direct implication that M implies P.\n\nIn other words, just because the truck is metal, it doesn't necessarily mean the doll is plastic. There could be other reasons why the truck is metal, and the doll could be made of a different material.\n\nAnswer: no",
