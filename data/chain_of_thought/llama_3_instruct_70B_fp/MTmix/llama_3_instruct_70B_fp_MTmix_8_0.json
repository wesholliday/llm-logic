            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"C \u2192 D\", where C is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and D is \"the sprocket must have been daggled\".\n\n2. \"The sprocket might not have been daggled\" - This statement can be represented as \"\u00acD\", where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n* If D is true (the sprocket was daggled), then C \u2192 D is true regardless of the value of C (cranked or not cranked).\n* If D is false (the sprocket was not daggled), then C \u2192 D is only true if C is also false (the sprocket was not cranked). This is because a false antecedent (C) makes the conditional statement true, regardless of the consequent (D).\n\nGiven \u00acD, we know that the sprocket was not daggled. From the analysis above, this implies that C must be false, i.e., the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
