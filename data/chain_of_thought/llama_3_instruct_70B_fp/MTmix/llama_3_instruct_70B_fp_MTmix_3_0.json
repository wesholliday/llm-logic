            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Morphed \u2192 Quanked\". It means that if the splat was morphed, then it necessarily quanked.\n\n2. \"The splat might not have quanked\" - This statement indicates that it's possible that the splat did not quank. In other words, we can't be certain that the splat quanked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked (from statement 1). But we know that the splat might not have quanked (from statement 2). This implies that the assumption \"the splat was morphed\" leads to a contradiction, since it would require the splat to have quanked, but we're told that it might not have quanked.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the assumption \"the splat was morphed\" must be false, because it leads to a logical contradiction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
