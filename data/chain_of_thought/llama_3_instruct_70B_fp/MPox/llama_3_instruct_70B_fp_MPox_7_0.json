The statement implies that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nWe know that the whiffle was shanked (from statement 1). We also know that if the whiffle was shanked, then it tinked (from statement 2). Since the antecedent of the conditional statement is true (the whiffle was shanked), we can infer that the consequent must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
