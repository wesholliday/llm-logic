'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged' - This statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition 'the clug was fleeked' is true, then the conclusion 'the clug snugged' must also be true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nWe are given that the clug was fleeked (statement 1). This satisfies the condition in the conditional statement (statement 2). Therefore, according to the conditional statement, if the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
