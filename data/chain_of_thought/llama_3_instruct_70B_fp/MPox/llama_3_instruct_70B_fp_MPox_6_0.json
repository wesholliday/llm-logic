It implies that if the condition is true, then the consequence must also be true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nWe know that the grommet was sploffed (from statement 1). This satisfies the condition in the conditional statement (statement 2). Therefore, according to the conditional statement, if the grommet was sploffed, then it must have plopped the frink.\n\nAnswer: yes",
