It implies that if the fribble is snurgled, then it must also be crinked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nWe know that the fribble was indeed snurgled (from statement 1). The conditional statement (2) tells us that if the fribble is snurgled, then it crinked. Since we have established that the fribble was snurgled, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that the fribble crinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
