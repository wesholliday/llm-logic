            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"The dreb was vroombed\" - This is a simple statement asserting that the dreb was vroombed.\n2. \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"p \u2192 q\", where \"p\" is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and \"q\" is \"the dreb was spened\".\n\nTo infer \"The dreb was spened\", we need to apply modus ponens, a rule of inference that states: if we have \"p\" and \"p \u2192 q\", we can conclude \"q\".\n\nIn this case, we have \"p\" (the dreb was vroombed) and \"p \u2192 q\" (if the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened). Therefore, we can apply modus ponens to conclude \"q\", which is \"The dreb was spened\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
