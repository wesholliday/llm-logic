It implies that if the wug was indeed sproinged, then it must also be garpled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nWe know that the wug was sproinged (from statement 1). The conditional statement (2) tells us that if the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled. Since we have established that the wug was indeed sproinged, we can conclude that the condition for the wug being garpled has been met.\n\nAnswer: yes",
