We have two statements:\n\n1. \"The twonk was plinked\"\n2. \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\"\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the twonk was indeed plinked. Now, let's examine statement 2, which is a conditional statement. It says that if the twonk was plinked, then a certain consequence follows, namely, that it was varnished.\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that the twonk was plinked, we can apply the conditional statement in statement 2. The condition \"the twonk was plinked\" is true, so we can infer the consequence \"it was varnished\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
