It means that if the glip is slogged, then it must also be tragged.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nWe know that the glip is slogged (from statement 1). The conditional statement (2) tells us that if the glip is slogged, then it must be tragged. Since the glip is indeed slogged, we can apply the conditional statement and conclude that the glip must also be tragged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
