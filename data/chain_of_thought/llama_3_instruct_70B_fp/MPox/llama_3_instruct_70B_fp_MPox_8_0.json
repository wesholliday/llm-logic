            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"The sprocket was cranked\" - This is a simple statement that asserts the sprocket was cranked.\n2. \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" - This is a conditional statement that implies a causal relationship between the sprocket being cranked and the sprocket being daggled. It can be rewritten as \"Cranked \u2192 Daggled\", where \"Cranked\" is the antecedent (condition) and \"Daggled\" is the consequent (result).\n\nNow, let's analyze the inference:\n\nWe are given that the sprocket was cranked (statement 1). The conditional statement (2) tells us that if the sprocket is cranked, then it must be daggled. Since we know the sprocket was cranked, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that the sprocket was indeed daggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
