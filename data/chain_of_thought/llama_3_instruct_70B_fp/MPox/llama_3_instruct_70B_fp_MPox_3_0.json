It can be rewritten as \"The splat was morphed \u2192 The splat quanked\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements together:\n\nWe know the splat was morphed (from statement 1). The conditional statement (2) says that if the splat was morphed, then it quanked. Since we have established that the splat was indeed morphed, we can conclude that the condition for quanking is met.\n\nAnswer: yes",
