            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"P \u2192 N\", where \"P\" stands for \"the shank was plooked\" and \"N\" stands for \"the shank was nugged\".\n\nTo determine if we can infer the new statement \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked\", we need to examine the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"P \u2192 N\" is \"\u00acN \u2192 \u00acP\", where \"\u00ac\" denotes negation.\n\nIn this case, \"\u00acN\" means \"the shank was not nugged\", and \"\u00acP\" means \"the shank was not plooked\". So, the contrapositive of the original statement is indeed \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
