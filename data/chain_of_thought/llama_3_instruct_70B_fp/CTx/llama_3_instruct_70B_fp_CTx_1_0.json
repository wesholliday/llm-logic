            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can make this inference, let's analyze the original statement: \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\" or \"A \u2192 B\". \n\nIn this case, \"A\" is \"the flugel was blimmed\" and \"B\" is \"the flugel was zargled\". The statement implies that if the flugel is blimmed, it must also be zargled. \n\nNow, let's consider the proposed inference: \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\" This can be represented as \"If not B, then not A\" or \"\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA\". \n\nThis is a classic example of a logical rule called contraposition. Contraposition states that if \"A \u2192 B\" is true, then \"\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA\" is also true. In other words, if the original statement is true, then the proposed inference must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
