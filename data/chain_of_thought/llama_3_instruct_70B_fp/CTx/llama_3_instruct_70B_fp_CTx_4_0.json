            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and Q is \"the fribble crinked\".\n\nTo infer the desired conclusion, \"If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\", we need to see if it follows logically from the original statement. This new statement can be represented as \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\nIn logic, this is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is a logically equivalent statement that swaps the antecedent and consequent, and negates both. In this case, the contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is indeed \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the desired conclusion from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
