            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"S \u2192 T\", where S stands for \"the glip was slogged\" and T stands for \"the glip was tragged\".\n\nTo infer the new statement \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged\", we need to check if it's a valid logical consequence of the original statement. This new statement can be represented as \"\u00acT \u2192 \u00acS\", where \u00acT means \"not T\" (the glip was not tragged) and \u00acS means \"not S\" (the glip was not slogged).\n\nIn logic, the rule of inference we're looking for is called \"modus tollens\". It states that if we have \"S \u2192 T\" and \u00acT, we can infer \u00acS. In our case, we have \"S \u2192 T\" (the original statement) and we want to infer \"\u00acT \u2192 \u00acS\". This is actually the contrapositive of the original statement, which is a logically equivalent statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of \"S \u2192 T\" is indeed \"\u00acT \u2192 \u00acS\", which means that if the glip was not tragged, then it was not slogged. This is a valid inference because if being slogged (S) implies being tragged (T), then not being tragged (\u00acT) implies not being slogged (\u00acS).\n\nAnswer: yes",
