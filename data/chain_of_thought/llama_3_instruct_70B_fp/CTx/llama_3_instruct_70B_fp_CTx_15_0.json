            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and B is \"the dreb was spened\". \n\nFrom this, we can infer that if A is true, then B must also be true. Now, let's consider the proposed inference: \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\". This can be represented as \"If not B, then not A\". \n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we can use the rule of contrapositive, which states that \"If A, then B\" is equivalent to \"If not B, then not A\". Since the original statement is \"If A, then B\", we can apply the contrapositive rule to infer \"If not B, then not A\", which is the proposed inference. \n\nAnswer: yes",
