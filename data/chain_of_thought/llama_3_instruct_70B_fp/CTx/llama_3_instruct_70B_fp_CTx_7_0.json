            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can make this inference, let's analyze the original statement: \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the whiffle was shanked\" and Q is \"the whiffle tinked.\"\n\nFrom this statement, we can infer that if P is true (the whiffle was shanked), then Q must also be true (the whiffle tinked). However, we cannot infer the converse, which would be \"If the whiffle tinked, then the whiffle was shanked.\" This is because the original statement only guarantees that shanking leads to tinkling, but it does not rule out the possibility that tinkling could occur through other means.\n\nNow, let's consider the proposed inference: \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked.\" This is a contrapositive statement, which can be represented as \"If not Q, then not P.\" In this case, not Q is \"the whiffle did not tink,\" and not P is \"the whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if \"If P, then Q\" is true, then \"If not Q, then not P\" must also be true. Therefore, we can indeed infer the proposed statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
