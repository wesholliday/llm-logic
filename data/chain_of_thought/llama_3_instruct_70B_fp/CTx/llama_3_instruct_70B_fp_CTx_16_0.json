            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can make this inference, we need to analyze the original statement and its contrapositive. The original statement is \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\", which can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the sneg was crampled\" and B is \"the sneg sproted the frink\".\n\nThe contrapositive of this statement is \"If not B, then not A\", which would be \"If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled\". This is the exact statement we are trying to infer.\n\nIn general, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer the contrapositive statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
