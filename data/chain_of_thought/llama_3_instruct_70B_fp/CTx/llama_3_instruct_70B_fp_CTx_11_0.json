This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Blummed \u2192 Zimmed\". \n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed\". This statement can be represented as \"Not Zimmed \u2192 Not Blummed\". \n\nTo determine if we can make this inference, let's analyze the original statement. If the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed. This implies that if the flug was not zimmed, it could not have been blummed. \n\nIn other words, the original statement sets up a conditional relationship between \"blummed\" and \"zimmed\", where \"blummed\" is a sufficient condition for \"zimmed\". This means that if \"zimmed\" is not true, then \"blummed\" cannot be true either. \n\nThis is a classic example of a logical rule called modus tollens, which states that if A \u2192 B and not B, then not A. In this case, A is \"blummed\" and B is \"zimmed\". \n\nAnswer: yes",
