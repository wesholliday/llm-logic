            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can make this inference, let's analyze the original statement: \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"F \u2192 S\", where F represents \"the zinger was fraggled\" and S represents \"the zinger was smoogled\".\n\nThe inference we're asked to consider is \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled\", which can be represented as \"\u00acS \u2192 \u00acF\". Here, \u00acS means \"the zinger was not smoogled\" and \u00acF means \"the zinger was not fraggled\".\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we can use the rule of contrapositive, which states that \"F \u2192 S\" is equivalent to \"\u00acS \u2192 \u00acF\". This means that if the original statement is true, then the inferred statement must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
