            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can make this inference, let's analyze the original statement: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"M \u2192 Q\", where \"M\" stands for \"the splat was morphed\" and \"Q\" stands for \"the splat quanked\".\n\nThe inference we're asked to consider is \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed\", which can be represented as \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acM\", where \"\u00ac\" denotes negation.\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we can use the rule of contrapositive, which states that \"P \u2192 Q\" is equivalent to \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\". In this case, we can apply the contrapositive rule to the original statement \"M \u2192 Q\" to get \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acM\", which is exactly the inference we're asked to consider.\n\nAnswer: yes",
