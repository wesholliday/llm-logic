            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can make this inference, let's analyze the original statement: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the grommet was sploffed\" and B is \"the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n\nThe inference we're asked to consider is \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\" This can be represented as \"If not B, then not A.\" This is a classic example of a logical rule called modus tollens.\n\nModus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. In this case, if we know that the grommet did not plop the frink (not B), we can infer that the grommet was not sploffed (not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
