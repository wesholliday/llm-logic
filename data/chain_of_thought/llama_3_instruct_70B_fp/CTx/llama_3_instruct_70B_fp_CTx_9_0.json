            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can make this inference, let's analyze the original statement: \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where \"P\" is \"the twonk was plinked\" and \"Q\" is \"it was varnished\".\n\nThe inference we're asked to consider is \"If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked\", which can be represented as \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\". This is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"P \u2192 Q\" is \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\", and it is always true if the original statement is true. This means that if \"P \u2192 Q\" is true, then \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\" must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer \"If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
