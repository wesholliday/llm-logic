            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can make this inference, let's analyze the original statement: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" This statement implies a causal relationship between cranking the sprocket and it being daggled. In other words, if the sprocket is cranked, it will necessarily be daggled.\n\nNow, let's consider the proposed inference: \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\" This statement is essentially the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nSince the contrapositive of a true statement is also true, we can infer that if the original statement is true, then the proposed inference is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
