This statement is saying that there are two possibilities about the meeting: it might be confidential, and it might involve important decisions. Since these two possibilities are connected with \"and\", we can infer that both possibilities are related to the meeting. \n\nIn particular, the possibility of the meeting involving important decisions is explicitly mentioned. Therefore, we can conclude that the meeting might indeed involve important decisions.\n\nAnswer: yes",
