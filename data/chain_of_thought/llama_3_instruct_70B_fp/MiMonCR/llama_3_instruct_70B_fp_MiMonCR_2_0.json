            "content": "Explanation: The original statement says \"The recipe might be complicated and require exotic ingredients\". This statement is saying that there are two possible things that might be true about the recipe: it might be complicated, and it might require exotic ingredients. \n\nSince the original statement is saying that the recipe might have these two properties, we can infer that it might have either one of them or both. Therefore, we can infer that the recipe might require exotic ingredients, because that is one of the possibilities mentioned in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
