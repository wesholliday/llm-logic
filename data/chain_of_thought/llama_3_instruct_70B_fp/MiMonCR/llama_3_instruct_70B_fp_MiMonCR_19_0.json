This implies that there is a possibility that the discovery is accidental and also leads to a Nobel Prize. \n\nNow, if we consider the statement \"The discovery might lead to a Nobel Prize\", it is saying that there is a possibility that the discovery leads to a Nobel Prize. \n\nSince the original statement already implies that the discovery might lead to a Nobel Prize (regardless of whether it's accidental or not), we can infer that the discovery might lead to a Nobel Prize.\n\nAnswer: yes",
