This statement is saying that two conditions must be met: the password must have been exactly 8 characters long, and it must have included a number. \n\nThe question is asking if we can infer \"The password must have been eight characters long and included a number\". This inferred statement is rephrasing the original statement, replacing \"it must have included a number\" with \"included a number\". \n\nThe meaning of the original statement and the inferred statement are the same, as \"it must have included a number\" and \"included a number\" are conveying the same information. \n\nAnswer: yes",
