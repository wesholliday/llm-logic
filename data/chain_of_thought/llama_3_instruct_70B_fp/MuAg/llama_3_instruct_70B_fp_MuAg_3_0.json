            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The car must be in the garage and it must need repairs\" can be broken down into two separate statements: \"The car must be in the garage\" and \"it must need repairs\". The word \"it\" in the second statement refers back to \"the car\", so we can replace \"it\" with \"the car\" to get \"the car must need repairs\". \n\nNow we have two separate statements: \"The car must be in the garage\" and \"the car must need repairs\". We can combine these two statements using \"and\" to get \"The car must be in the garage and need repairs\". This new statement has the same meaning as the original statement, but with a slightly different wording.\n\nAnswer: yes",
