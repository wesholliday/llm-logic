This statement is a conjunction of two clauses: \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays\" and \"it must have served Italian cuisine\". \n\nIn logic, when we have a conjunction of two clauses, we can infer that both clauses are true. Therefore, we can infer that the restaurant was closed on Mondays and it served Italian cuisine. \n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays and served Italian cuisine\", which is the same as the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes",
