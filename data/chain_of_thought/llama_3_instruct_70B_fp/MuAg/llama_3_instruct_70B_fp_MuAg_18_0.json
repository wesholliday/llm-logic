The conjunction \"and\" is used to connect these two clauses, indicating that both conditions must be true. \n\nThe inferred statement is a rephrased version of the original statement, using a single sentence to convey the same meaning. It combines the two clauses using the conjunction \"and\" in the same way as the original statement. \n\nSince the original statement requires both conditions to be true, and the inferred statement also requires both conditions to be true, the meaning is preserved. \n\nAnswer: yes",
