            "content": "Explanation: The original statement says \"The application must have been completed online and it must have included references\". This statement is saying that there are two necessary conditions for the application: it must have been completed online, and it must have included references. \n\nIn the inferred statement, \"The application must have been completed online and included references\", the meaning is the same. It is still saying that both conditions must be met: the application must have been completed online, and it must have included references. \n\nThe only difference is in the wording, where \"it must have included references\" is shortened to \"included references\". However, this does not change the meaning of the sentence, and the inferred statement is still conveying the same information as the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
