This means that the document cannot exist without both of these conditions being met. \n\nIn the inferred statement \"The document must have been signed and notarized\", the conjunction \"and\" is used to connect the two conditions. This implies that both conditions are still necessary, which is consistent with the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
