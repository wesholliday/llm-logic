            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package must have been delivered today and it must have been signed for\" implies that two separate conditions must be true: the package was delivered today, and it was signed for. The phrase \"it must have been signed for\" refers to the package, so we can replace \"it\" with \"the package\" to get \"The package must have been delivered today and the package must have been signed for\". This statement is logically equivalent to \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for\", which combines the two conditions into a single phrase.\n\nAnswer: yes",
