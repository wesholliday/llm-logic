The contrapositive of \"If A, then not B\" is \"If B, then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed.\"\n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide enough information to support this contrapositive. The original statement only tells us that if the issue was addressed, it was not done so effectively, but it does not provide any information about what happens when the issue is addressed effectively.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the desired conclusion from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
