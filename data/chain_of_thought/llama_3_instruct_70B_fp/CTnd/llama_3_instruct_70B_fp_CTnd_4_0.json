This statement implies that if Ben studied, it must be the case that he did not study diligently. \n\nNow, let's analyze the statement we want to infer: \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study\". This statement implies that if Ben studied diligently, it must be the case that he did not study. \n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide any information about what happens when Ben studies diligently. It only tells us what happens when Ben studies (i.e., he does not study diligently). \n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that if Ben studied diligently, he did not study. The original statement does not provide enough information to make this inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
