This can be rewritten as \"A strong recommendation implies not a recommendation.\" \n\nTo determine if we can make this inference, let's analyze the relationships between the statements. The original statement tells us that if a recommendation is made, it's not strong. However, it doesn't provide any information about what happens when a strong recommendation is made. \n\nIn particular, the original statement doesn't rule out the possibility that a strong recommendation is a type of recommendation. In fact, it's reasonable to assume that a strong recommendation is a subset of all recommendations. \n\nIf that's the case, then making a strong recommendation would also imply making a recommendation. This contradicts the inference we're trying to make, which is that a strong recommendation implies not making a recommendation. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
