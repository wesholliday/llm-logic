This statement implies that exercising and exercising strenuously are mutually exclusive, meaning that if Ann exercised, she must not have exercised strenuously.\n\nNow, let's analyze the proposed inference: \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise\". This statement seems to be saying the opposite of the original statement. However, if we think about it, exercising strenuously is a subset of exercising in general. If Ann exercised strenuously, it means she did exercise, but in a strenuous manner.\n\nThe original statement only tells us that if Ann exercised, she didn't exercise strenuously. It doesn't provide any information about what happens if Ann exercises strenuously. In other words, the original statement doesn't imply that exercising strenuously means Ann didn't exercise at all.\n\nAnswer: no",
