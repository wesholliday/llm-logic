            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice.\" This statement implies that whenever advice is offered, it is not helpful. Now, let's analyze the inferred statement: \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered.\" This statement seems to be saying the opposite: if the advice is helpful, then no advice was offered.\n\nTo determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n1. Advice was offered, and it was helpful. This contradicts the original statement, so it's not possible.\n2. Advice was offered, and it was not helpful. This is consistent with the original statement.\n3. No advice was offered. This is also consistent with the original statement, as it doesn't provide any information about the helpfulness of the advice.\n\nNow, let's examine the inferred statement. If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered. This implies that helpful advice cannot be offered, which is not necessarily true. The original statement only says that if advice is offered, it's not helpful, but it doesn't rule out the possibility of helpful advice being offered.\n\nAnswer: no",
