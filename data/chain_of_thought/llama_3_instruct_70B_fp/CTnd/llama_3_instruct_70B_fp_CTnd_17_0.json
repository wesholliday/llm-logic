This statement implies that if the customer was greeted, it was not a warm greeting. \n\nNow, let's analyze the statement we want to infer: \"If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted\". This statement is saying that if the customer received a warm greeting, then they didn't receive a greeting at all. \n\nHowever, the original statement doesn't provide any information about what happens when the customer is greeted warmly. It only talks about what happens when the customer is greeted (not warmly). \n\nTherefore, we cannot make any conclusions about what happens when the customer is greeted warmly based on the original statement. \n\nAnswer: no",
