This can be rewritten as \"Given instructions, not clearly explained\" or in symbolic form as \"G \u2192 \u00acC\", where G represents \"instructions were given\" and C represents \"instructions were explained clearly\".\n\nTo infer the new statement \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given\", we can try to rewrite it in a similar form. This would be \"Clearly explained, not given\" or \"C \u2192 \u00acG\".\n\nHowever, we need to be careful when making this inference. The original statement only tells us that if instructions were given, they were not clearly explained. It does not provide any information about the converse situation, where instructions were clearly explained. \n\nIn particular, the original statement does not rule out the possibility that instructions were both given and clearly explained. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that if instructions were explained clearly, then they were not given.\n\nAnswer: no",
