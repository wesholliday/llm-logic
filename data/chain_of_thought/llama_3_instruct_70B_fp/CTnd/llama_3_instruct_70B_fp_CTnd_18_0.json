This statement implies that if the issue was discussed, it must not have been discussed in depth. \n\nNow, let's analyze the proposed inference: \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed\". This statement is saying that if the issue was discussed in depth, then it must not have been discussed at all. \n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide enough information to make this inference. The original statement only tells us that if the issue was discussed, it was not in depth, but it does not tell us anything about what happens if the issue was discussed in depth. \n\nIn other words, it's possible that the issue was discussed in depth, and it was still discussed. The original statement does not rule out this possibility. Therefore, we cannot make the proposed inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
