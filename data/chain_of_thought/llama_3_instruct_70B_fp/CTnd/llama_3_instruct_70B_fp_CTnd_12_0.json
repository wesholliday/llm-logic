This statement implies that if Jane studied, it must be the case that she did not study long. \n\nNow, let's analyze the statement we want to infer: \"If Jane studied long, then she did not study\". This statement implies that if Jane studied long, it must be the case that she did not study. \n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide any information about what happens if Jane studied long. It only tells us what happens if Jane studied (i.e., she did not study long). It does not rule out the possibility that Jane studied and studied long. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the desired statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
