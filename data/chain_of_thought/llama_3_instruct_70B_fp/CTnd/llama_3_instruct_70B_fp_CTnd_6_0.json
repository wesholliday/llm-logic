This statement implies that if the clothes were washed, it must be the case that they were not washed properly. \n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed\" from the given statement. \n\nTo do this, let's analyze the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive of \"If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly\" is \"If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed\". \n\nHowever, just because we can form the contrapositive of the given statement, it does not necessarily mean that it is true. The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement, but it does not provide any additional information.\n\nIn this case, we cannot infer the truth of \"If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed\" solely from the given statement \"If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly\". \n\nAnswer: no",
