This statement implies that if Alex exercised, the extent of his exercise was limited. It does not provide any information about what would happen if Alex exercised much.\n\nTo infer \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise\", we would need to assume that exercising much is mutually exclusive with exercising. However, the original statement does not provide any evidence for this assumption. In fact, exercising much is a superset of exercising, so it's possible that Alex exercised and also exercised much.\n\nTherefore, we cannot make a logical inference from the original statement to the desired conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
