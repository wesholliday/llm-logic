If we can show that \u00acW \u2192 \u00acC is true, then we can conclude that W \u2192 \u00acC is also true.\n\nHowever, the given statement \"C \u2192 \u00acW\" does not directly imply \"\u00acW \u2192 \u00acC\". In fact, it's possible to have a scenario where the job was not completed well (\u00acW) but still completed (C).\n\nAnswer: no",
