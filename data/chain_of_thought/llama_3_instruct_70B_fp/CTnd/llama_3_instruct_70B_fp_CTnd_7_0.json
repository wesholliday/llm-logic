This can be rewritten as \"Served \u2192 \u00acPromptly Served\", where \"Served\" means the customer was served, and \"Promptly Served\" means the customer was served promptly.\n\nTo infer the desired conclusion, \"If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served\", we can rewrite it as \"Promptly Served \u2192 \u00acServed\". \n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship between the two statements. The original statement says that if the customer was served, it implies they were not served promptly. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the customer was served promptly, they were not served at all. \n\nIn other words, the original statement only rules out the possibility of prompt service when the customer is served, but it does not provide any information about the customer being served or not when they are served promptly. \n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the desired conclusion from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
