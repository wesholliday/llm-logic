            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statement: \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly\". This statement implies that if the room was cleaned, it must have some defects or shortcomings in the cleaning process, i.e., it was not done thoroughly.\n\nNow, let's analyze the proposed inference: \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\". This statement seems to be saying the opposite of the original statement. If the room was cleaned thoroughly, it means the cleaning process was done perfectly, without any defects or shortcomings.\n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide any information about what happens when the room is cleaned thoroughly. It only talks about the consequences of the room being cleaned (i.e., it was not done thoroughly). It does not provide any implications for the case when the room is cleaned thoroughly.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the proposed statement from the original statement. The original statement does not provide enough information to make a conclusion about the case when the room is cleaned thoroughly.\n\nAnswer: no",
