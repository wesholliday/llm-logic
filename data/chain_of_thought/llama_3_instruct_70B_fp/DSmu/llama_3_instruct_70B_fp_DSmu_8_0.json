It's possible that both are true, but we can't conclude that yet.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" - This statement negates the second option from the first statement. It tells us that the remote control is not hiding under the couch.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from both statements. We know that either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch, but it's not hiding under the couch. This means that the only remaining option is that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
