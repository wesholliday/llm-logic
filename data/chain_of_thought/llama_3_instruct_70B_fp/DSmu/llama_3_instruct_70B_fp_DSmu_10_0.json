It's possible that both options are true, but we can't conclude that yet.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\" - This statement negates the second option from the first statement. It means that the missing sock is not necessarily under the bed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince the second option (the sock being under the bed) is negated, and the first statement says that at least one of the options must be true, we are left with only one possibility: the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
