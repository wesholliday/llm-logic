It's possible that both are true, but we can't conclude that from this statement alone.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch\" - This statement negates the second option from the first statement. It means that the newspaper does not necessarily have to be sitting on the porch.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from both statements. Since the second option (newspaper must be sitting on the porch) is negated, and the first statement says it's either one or the other, we are left with only one possibility: the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes",
