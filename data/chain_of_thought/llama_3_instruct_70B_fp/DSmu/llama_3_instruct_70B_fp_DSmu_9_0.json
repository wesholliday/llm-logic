            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. The first statement is a disjunction, which means it's an \"or\" statement. It says that either the puzzle piece is in the box or it's blending in on the floor. This implies that if one of the options is not true, the other one must be true.\n\nThe second statement is a negation of the second part of the disjunction. It says that it's not the case that the puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor. This means that the second option is eliminated, leaving us with only one possibility.\n\nUsing the principle of disjunctive syllogism, which states that if we have a disjunction and we know that one of the disjuncts is false, we can infer that the other disjunct is true. In this case, we know that the puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, so we can infer that it must be in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
