It says that either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom. This implies that if the cat is not playing in the bedroom, then it must be napping on the couch.\n\nThe second statement negates the possibility of the cat playing in the bedroom. This means that the \"or\" part of the first statement is eliminated, leaving us with only one option: the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
