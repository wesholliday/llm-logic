            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" which can be represented as \"If A, then B\" or \"A \u2192 B\". We also know that \"The pants were denim\" which is equivalent to \"B\". \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"The shirt was cotton\" which is equivalent to \"A\". \n\nIn a conditional statement, if we know the consequence (B) is true, it does not necessarily mean the antecedent (A) is true. There could be other reasons why the consequence is true. \n\nIn this case, we only know that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim, but we don't know if there are other scenarios where the pants could be denim. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the shirt was cotton just because the pants were denim.\n\nAnswer: no",
