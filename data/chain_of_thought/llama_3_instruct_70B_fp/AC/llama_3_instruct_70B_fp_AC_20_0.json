            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow\".\n2. \"The banana was yellow\" - This is a statement that affirms the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The apple was red\" (A), we need to examine the relationship between the antecedent (A) and the consequent (B). In this case, we know that B is true, but we don't have any direct information about A.\n\nThe problem is that the conditional statement only guarantees that if A is true, then B must be true. It does not provide any information about what happens when B is true but A is false. In other words, the statement \"A \u2192 B\" does not imply \"B \u2192 A\".\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that \"The apple was red\" (A) solely based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
