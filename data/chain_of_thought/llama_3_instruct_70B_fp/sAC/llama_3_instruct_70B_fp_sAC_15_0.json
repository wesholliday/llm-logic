We know that \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is true, which means that if the condition \"Sam took a plane\" is true, then the consequence \"Erin took a train\" must also be true. We also know that \"Erin took a train\" is indeed true.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that \"Sam took a plane\" is true. There could be other reasons why Erin took a train, unrelated to Sam taking a plane. The original statement only guarantees that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train, but it does not guarantee the converse, that if Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: no",
