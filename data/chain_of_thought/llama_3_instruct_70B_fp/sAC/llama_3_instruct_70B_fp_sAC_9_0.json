            "content": "Explanation: We are given a conditional statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\". We are also given that Q is true, i.e., \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true. \n\nNow, we need to determine if P is true, i.e., \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if Q is true, it does not necessarily mean that P is true. There could be other reasons why Q is true. \n\nFor example, consider the statement \"If it rains, then the street will be wet\". If the street is wet, it does not necessarily mean that it rained. The street could be wet due to other reasons like a water main break or a flood. \n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
