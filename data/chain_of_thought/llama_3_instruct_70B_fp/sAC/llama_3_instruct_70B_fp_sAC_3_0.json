This implies that if the book is written by James, it must be a mystery novel.\n2. \"The book is a mystery novel\" is true. This tells us that the book indeed belongs to the mystery novel genre.\n\nNow, let's examine the conclusion: \"The book was written by James\" is true. We need to determine if this follows logically from the given statements.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the book is written by James, it's a mystery novel. But statement 2 only tells us that the book is a mystery novel, not necessarily that it was written by James. There could be other authors who wrote mystery novels as well.\n\nIn other words, just because the book is a mystery novel, it doesn't necessarily mean it was written by James. There might be other authors who wrote mystery novels.\n\nAnswer: no",
