            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given information. We know that \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is true, which means that if Mary was present at the wedding, then Sue must have been present too. This is a conditional statement, and it does not provide any information about Mary's presence at the wedding on its own.\n\nWe also know that \"Sue was at the wedding\" is true, which means Sue was indeed present at the wedding. However, this information alone does not guarantee Mary's presence.\n\nTo determine whether Mary was at the wedding, we need to examine the conditional statement again. Since Sue was at the wedding, it's possible that Mary was also present, but it's not necessarily the case. The conditional statement only guarantees that if Mary was present, then Sue would be present too, but it does not provide a direct implication about Mary's presence.\n\nAnswer: no",
