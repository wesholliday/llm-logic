We are given that \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is true, which means that if the apple was indeed red, then it necessarily follows that the banana was yellow. This is a conditional statement, where the truth of the antecedent (the apple being red) implies the truth of the consequent (the banana being yellow).\n\nWe are also given that \"The banana was yellow\" is true. Now, we need to determine if we can conclude that \"The apple was red\" is true.\n\nFrom the given conditional statement, we know that if the apple was red, then the banana would be yellow. But the converse is not necessarily true - just because the banana is yellow, it doesn't mean the apple was red. There could be other reasons why the banana is yellow, unrelated to the apple's color.\n\nAnswer: no",
