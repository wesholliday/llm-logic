We know that \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is true, which means that if the condition \"Tom watched football\" is true, then the consequence \"Jen watched basketball\" must also be true. We also know that \"Jen watched basketball\" is indeed true.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that \"Tom watched football\" is true. There could be other reasons why \"Jen watched basketball\" is true, unrelated to Tom watching football. The original statement only guarantees that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball, but it does not guarantee the converse, that if Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football.\n\nAnswer: no",
