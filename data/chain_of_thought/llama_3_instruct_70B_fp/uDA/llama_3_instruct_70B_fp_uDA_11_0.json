We are told that \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the cake was chocolate\" and B is \"the muffins were blueberry\". \n\nFrom this statement, we can infer that if the cake was indeed chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. However, we are also told that \"the cake was not chocolate\". This means that the condition \"A\" (the cake being chocolate) is not true.\n\nSince the condition \"A\" is not true, we cannot conclude anything about \"B\" (the muffins being blueberry) based on this conditional statement alone. The statement only guarantees that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would be blueberry, but it does not provide any information about the muffins when the cake is not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
