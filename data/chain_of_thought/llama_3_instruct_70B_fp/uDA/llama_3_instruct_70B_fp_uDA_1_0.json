            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given information step by step. We are told that \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This implies a conditional relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence. In other words, if Mary was present, then Sue must have been present too.\n\nNext, we are told that \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" This means that the condition \"Mary was at the wedding\" is not true.\n\nNow, let's examine the implication of this on Sue's presence. Since the condition \"Mary was at the wedding\" is not true, we cannot conclude that Sue was at the wedding based on the given conditional relationship. However, we can infer that if Mary's presence is not sufficient to guarantee Sue's presence, then Sue's presence is not guaranteed either.\n\nIn other words, the absence of Mary does not provide any direct evidence for or against Sue's presence. However, since the conditional relationship only guarantees Sue's presence if Mary is present, and Mary is not present, we can infer that Sue's presence is not guaranteed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
