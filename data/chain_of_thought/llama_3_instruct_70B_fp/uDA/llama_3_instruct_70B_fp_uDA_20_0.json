The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow\". \n\nThe second statement is \"the apple was not red\", which means A is false. \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that the banana was not yellow (i.e., B is false). \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (A) is false, we cannot conclude anything about the consequence (B). The statement only guarantees that if A is true, then B must be true, but it does not provide any information about B when A is false. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the banana was not yellow based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
