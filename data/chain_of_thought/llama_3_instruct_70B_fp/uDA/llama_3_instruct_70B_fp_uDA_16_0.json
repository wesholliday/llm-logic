We are told that \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the shirt was cotton\" and B is \"the pants were denim\". \n\nFrom this statement, we can infer that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. However, we are also told that \"the shirt was not cotton\". This means that the condition \"A\" is not true. \n\nIn this case, we cannot make any conclusions about the pants being denim or not denim, because the conditional statement only tells us what happens when the shirt is cotton, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when the shirt is not cotton.\n\nAnswer: no",
