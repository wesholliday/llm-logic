We are told that \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This implies that if the condition \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true, then the consequence \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" must also be true. However, we are also told that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" This means the condition \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is false. \n\nSince the condition is false, we cannot conclude anything about the consequence \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" based on the given information. The consequence might be true or false, but we cannot determine its truth value from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
