We are told that \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Ben ate pasta \u2192 Kate ate salad\". \n\nNext, we are told that \"Ben did not eat pasta\". This means that the condition \"Ben ate pasta\" is not true. \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that Kate did not eat salad. Since the condition \"Ben ate pasta\" is not true, we cannot conclude anything about Kate eating salad or not eating salad based on the given conditional statement. The statement only tells us what would happen if Ben ate pasta, but it does not provide any information about what happens if Ben does not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: no",
