The first statement says \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal\". \n\nThe second statement says \"the doll was not plastic\", which means P is false. \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that the truck was not metal (i.e., Q is false). \n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if P is true, then Q must be true. But we know P is false. This does not provide any information about Q. There are two possible scenarios: Q could be true or Q could be false. \n\nWe cannot infer the truth value of Q (whether the truck was metal or not) based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
