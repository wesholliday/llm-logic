We are told that \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This implies that if the condition \"Sam took a plane\" is true, then the consequence \"Erin took a train\" must also be true. However, we are also told that \"Sam did not take a plane.\" This means the condition \"Sam took a plane\" is actually false.\n\nSince the condition is false, we cannot conclude anything about the consequence \"Erin took a train\" based on the original implication. The implication only guarantees that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train, but it does not provide any information about what happens when Sam does not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: no",
