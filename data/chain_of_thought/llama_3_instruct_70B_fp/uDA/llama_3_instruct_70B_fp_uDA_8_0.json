            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. The first statement says that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This implies a conditional relationship between the two, where the vampire's wakefulness is a sufficient condition for the mummy's wakefulness. The second statement says that the vampire was not awake.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the vampire was awake, the mummy would also be awake. But since the vampire was not awake (second statement), we cannot conclude that the mummy was awake. However, we can infer that if the vampire was not awake, it's possible that the mummy was not awake either, because the vampire's wakefulness was a condition for the mummy's wakefulness.\n\nAnswer: yes",
