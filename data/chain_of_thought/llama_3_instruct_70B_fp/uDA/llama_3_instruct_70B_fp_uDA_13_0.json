The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the car was red\" and B is \"the truck was blue\". \n\nThe second statement is \"the car was not red\", which means A is false. \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that the truck was not blue (i.e., B is false). \n\nIn a conditional statement, if A is false, we cannot conclude anything about B. The statement only tells us what happens when A is true, but it doesn't provide any information about what happens when A is false. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the truck was not blue based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
