We are told that \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This implies that if Alex finished, Chris must have finished as well. However, we are also told that \"Alex did not finish the race.\" This means that the condition \"Alex finished the race\" is not true.\n\nSince the condition is not true, we cannot directly conclude that Chris finished the race. In fact, we can infer that Chris might not have finished the race, because the only scenario where we knew Chris finished was if Alex finished, but Alex did not finish.\n\nAnswer: yes",
