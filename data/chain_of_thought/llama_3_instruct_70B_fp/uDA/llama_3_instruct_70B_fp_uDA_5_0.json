We are told that \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\" or \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"Jeff played basketball\" and B is \"Amy played tennis\". \n\nWe are also told that \"Jeff did not play basketball\", which means the condition A is false. \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that Amy did not play tennis. Since the condition A is false, the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" does not provide any information about B. In other words, the truth value of B (Amy played tennis) is unknown. \n\nAnswer: no",
