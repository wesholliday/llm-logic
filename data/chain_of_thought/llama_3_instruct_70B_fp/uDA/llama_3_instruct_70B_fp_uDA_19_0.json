We are told that \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This implies that if the condition \"Tom watched football\" is true, then the consequence \"Jen watched basketball\" must also be true. However, we are also told that \"Tom did not watch football.\" This means the condition \"Tom watched football\" is false.\n\nSince the condition is false, we cannot conclude anything about the consequence \"Jen watched basketball\" based on the given implication. The implication only guarantees that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball, but it does not provide any information about what happens when Tom does not watch football.\n\nIn other words, the fact that Tom did not watch football does not provide enough information to determine whether Jen watched basketball or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
