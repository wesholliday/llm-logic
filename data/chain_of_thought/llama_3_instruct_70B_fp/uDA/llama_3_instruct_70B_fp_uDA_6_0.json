We know that \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This implies that if the condition \"Sue chose pizza\" is true, then the consequence \"Bob chose pasta\" must also be true. However, we are also told that \"Sue did not choose pizza.\" This means the condition \"Sue chose pizza\" is actually false.\n\nSince the condition is false, we cannot conclude anything about the consequence \"Bob chose pasta\" based on the original implication. The implication only guarantees that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta, but it does not provide any information about what happens when Sue does not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: no",
