We are told that \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This implies that if James is the author, the book must be a mystery novel. However, we are also told that \"the book was not written by James.\" This means that James is not the author of the book.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that the book is not a mystery novel. The initial statement only guarantees that if James wrote the book, it would be a mystery novel. It does not provide any information about the book's genre if James did not write it. In other words, there is no direct connection between the book not being written by James and the book not being a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: no",
