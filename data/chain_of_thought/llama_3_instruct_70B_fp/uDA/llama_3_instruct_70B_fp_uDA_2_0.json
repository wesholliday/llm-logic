This implies that the presence of the griffin in the forest is a sufficient condition for the unicorn to be in the forest.\n2. The griffin was not in the forest.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the griffin was not in the forest. Now, let's examine the implications of statement 1. Since the griffin was not in the forest, we cannot conclude that the unicorn was in the forest based on the given information. The presence of the griffin was a necessary condition for us to infer the presence of the unicorn, but since the griffin was not there, we cannot make any conclusions about the unicorn.\n\nAnswer: no",
