The wug was sproinged.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the wug was sproinged\" and Q is \"it was garpled\". This statement implies that if the condition P is true, then Q must also be true.\n\nThe second statement asserts that P is indeed true, i.e., the wug was sproinged.\n\nNow, we can apply the principle of modus ponens, which states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, then we can conclude that Q is also true.\n\nIn this case, we have \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" (If P, then Q) and \"The wug was sproinged\" (P is true). Therefore, we can infer that \"It was garpled\" (Q is true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
