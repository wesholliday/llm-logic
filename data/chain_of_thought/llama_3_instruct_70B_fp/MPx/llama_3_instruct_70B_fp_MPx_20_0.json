            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and B is \"it surned\".\n2. \"The fleeg was bluttered\" - This is a statement that asserts the truth of A, i.e., \"the fleeg was bluttered\".\n\nNow, we can apply modus ponens, a rule of inference, which states that if we have \"If A, then B\" and A, we can infer B. In this case, we have \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" (If A, then B) and \"The fleeg was bluttered\" (A), so we can infer \"it surned\" (B).\n\nAnswer: yes",
