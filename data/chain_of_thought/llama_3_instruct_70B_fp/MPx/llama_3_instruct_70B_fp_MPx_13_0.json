We have a conditional statement \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\" which can be represented as \"If A, then B\" where A is \"the glip was slogged\" and B is \"the glip was tragged\". We also have a statement \"The glip was slogged\" which is the same as A.\n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (A) is true, then the conclusion (B) must also be true. Since we know that A is true (the glip was slogged), we can infer that B must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
