            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and B is \"the dreb was spened\".\n2. \"The dreb was vroombed\" - This is a statement that asserts the truth of A.\n\nTo infer a conclusion, we can use modus ponens, a rule of inference that states: if A \u2192 B and A are true, then B must be true.\n\nIn this case, we have A \u2192 B (the conditional statement) and A (the assertion that the dreb was vroombed). Therefore, we can apply modus ponens to conclude that B, \"the dreb was spened\", must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
