            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" which can be represented as \"If A, then B\" where A is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and B is \"the sprocket was daggled\". We also have a statement \"The sprocket was cranked\" which is the same as A.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"The sprocket was daggled\" (B) from the given statements. Since we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true (the sprocket was cranked), we can apply modus ponens, a rule of inference, which states that if we have \"If A, then B\" and A, we can conclude B.\n\nAnswer: yes",
