            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" which can be represented as \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"the splat was morphed\" and B is \"the splat quanked\". We also have a statement \"The splat was morphed\" which is equivalent to A.\n\nTo infer \"The splat quanked\" (B), we need to apply modus ponens, a rule of inference that states: if A \u2192 B and A are true, then B must be true. In this case, we have A \u2192 B and A, so we can conclude B.\n\nAnswer: yes",
