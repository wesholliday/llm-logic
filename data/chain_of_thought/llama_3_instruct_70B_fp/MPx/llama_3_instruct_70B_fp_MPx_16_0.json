            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"the sneg was crampled\" and B is \"the sneg sproted the frink\".\n2. \"The sneg was crampled\" - This is a statement that asserts the truth of A.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"The sneg sproted the frink\" (B) from these two statements. In a conditional statement, if the antecedent (A) is true, and the conditional statement is true, then the consequent (B) must also be true. This is known as modus ponens.\n\nIn this case, we have A (the sneg was crampled) as true, and the conditional statement \"A \u2192 B\" is given as true. Therefore, we can conclude that B (the sneg sproted the frink) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
