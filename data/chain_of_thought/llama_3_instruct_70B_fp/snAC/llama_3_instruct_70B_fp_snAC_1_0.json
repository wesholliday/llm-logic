            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given information. We know that \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is true, which means that if Mary was present at the wedding, then Sue must have been present too. This is a conditional statement, and it does not provide any information about Mary's presence at the wedding on its own.\n\nWe also know that \"Sue was at the wedding\" is true, which means Sue was indeed present at the wedding. However, this information alone does not guarantee Mary's presence.\n\nThe key point to consider is that the conditional statement only guarantees Sue's presence if Mary was present, but it does not provide any information about Mary's presence if Sue is present. There could be other reasons why Sue was at the wedding, unrelated to Mary's presence.\n\nAnswer: no",
