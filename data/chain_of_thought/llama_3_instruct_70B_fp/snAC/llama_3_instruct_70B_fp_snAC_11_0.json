We know that \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is true, which means that if the cake was indeed chocolate, then it must be the case that the muffins were blueberry. We also know that \"The muffins were blueberry\" is true. \n\nNow, we need to determine if it necessarily follows that \"The cake was chocolate\" is true. To do this, let's consider the possibilities. If the muffins were blueberry, it could be because the cake was chocolate (as stated in the first statement), but it could also be because of some other reason unrelated to the cake's flavor. \n\nIn other words, the fact that the muffins were blueberry does not provide conclusive evidence that the cake was chocolate. There might be other factors that led to the muffins being blueberry. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the cake was chocolate based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
