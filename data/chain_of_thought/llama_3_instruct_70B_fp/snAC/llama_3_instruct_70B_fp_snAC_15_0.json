We know that \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is true, which means that whenever Sam takes a plane, Erin takes a train. We also know that \"Erin took a train\" is true. \n\nNow, we need to determine if it necessarily follows that \"Sam took a plane\" is true. \n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if Sam takes a plane, Erin takes a train. But it doesn't mean that if Erin takes a train, Sam must have taken a plane. There could be other reasons why Erin took a train. \n\nFor example, maybe Erin always takes a train, regardless of what Sam does. In that case, the fact that Erin took a train doesn't necessarily mean that Sam took a plane. \n\nSo, we can't conclude that \"Sam took a plane\" is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
