We know that \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is true, which means that if James wrote the book, it must be a mystery novel. We also know that \"The book is a mystery novel\" is true, which means the book indeed belongs to the mystery novel genre.\n\nNow, let's examine the conclusion \"The book was written by James\". We can't necessarily conclude that James wrote the book just because it's a mystery novel. There could be other authors who wrote mystery novels as well. The first statement only guarantees that if James wrote the book, it would be a mystery novel, but it doesn't guarantee that James is the only one who could have written a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: no",
