We know that \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is true, which means that if the condition \"Jeff played basketball\" is true, then the consequence \"Amy played tennis\" must also be true. We also know that \"Amy played tennis\" is true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. If \"Amy played tennis\" is true, it could be because \"Jeff played basketball\" is true, which would satisfy the conditional statement. However, it's also possible that \"Amy played tennis\" is true for some other reason, unrelated to Jeff playing basketball. The conditional statement only guarantees that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis, but it doesn't exclude other possibilities for Amy playing tennis.\n\nAnswer: no",
