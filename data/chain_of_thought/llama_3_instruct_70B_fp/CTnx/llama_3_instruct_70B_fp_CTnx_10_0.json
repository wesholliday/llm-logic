            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can make this inference, let's analyze the given statement: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was not garpled.\" This statement implies that sproinging and garpling are mutually exclusive, meaning that if one occurs, the other cannot occur.\n\nNow, let's examine the proposed inference: \"If the wug was garpled, then the wug was not sproinged.\" This statement is essentially the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the wug was not not garpled (i.e., garpled), then the wug was not sproinged.\"\n\nSince the contrapositive of a true statement is always true, and the original statement is given as true, we can conclude that the proposed inference is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
