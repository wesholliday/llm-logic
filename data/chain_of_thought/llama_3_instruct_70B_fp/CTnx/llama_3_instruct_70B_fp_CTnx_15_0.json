            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statement: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was not spened\". This is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and Q is \"the dreb was not spened\". \n\nTo infer the desired conclusion, \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\", we need to check if it is a valid logical consequence of the given statement. \n\nOne way to approach this is to use the concept of contrapositive. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\", which is always logically equivalent. \n\nIn our case, the contrapositive of the given statement would be \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\", which is exactly what we want to infer. \n\nHowever, we need to be careful. The contrapositive is only equivalent to the original statement, not the converse. The converse would be \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was vroombed\", which is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
