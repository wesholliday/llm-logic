            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statement: \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"B \u2192 \u00acZ\", where \"B\" stands for \"the flugel was blimmed\" and \"Z\" stands for \"the flugel was zargled\". \n\nTo infer the desired conclusion, \"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed\", we need to show that \"Z \u2192 \u00acB\" follows from \"B \u2192 \u00acZ\". \n\nOne way to approach this is to use the contrapositive rule, which states that \"P \u2192 Q\" is equivalent to \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\". Applying this rule to the given statement \"B \u2192 \u00acZ\", we get \"\u00ac(\u00acZ) \u2192 \u00acB\", which simplifies to \"Z \u2192 \u00acB\". \n\nThis shows that the desired conclusion \"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed\" indeed follows from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
