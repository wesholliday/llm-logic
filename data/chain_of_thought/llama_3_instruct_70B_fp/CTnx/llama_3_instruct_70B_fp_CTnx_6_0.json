            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then not B\", where A is \"the grommet was sploffed\" and B is \"the grommet plopped the frink\".\n\nTo infer the desired conclusion, \"If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed\", we need to see if we can derive it from the original statement. This desired conclusion can be represented as \"If B, then not A\".\n\nNotice that the original statement and the desired conclusion are contrapositives of each other. In general, if we have a statement \"If A, then B\", its contrapositive is \"If not B, then not A\". In this case, the contrapositive of \"If A, then not B\" is indeed \"If B, then not A\".\n\nSince the contrapositive of a true statement is also true, we can infer the desired conclusion from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
