            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can make this inference, let's analyze the original statement: \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg did not sproted the frink.\" This statement can be rewritten in a more familiar form as \"If A, then not B,\" where A is \"the sneg was crampled\" and B is \"the sneg sproted the frink.\"\n\nNow, let's examine the proposed inference: \"If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\" This statement can be rewritten as \"If B, then not A.\" This is a classic example of a logical rule called contraposition. Contraposition states that if we have a statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" we can infer the statement \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, we have \"If A, then not B,\" and we want to infer \"If B, then not A.\"\n\nSince the original statement is in the form \"If A, then not B,\" we can apply contraposition to infer \"If B, then not A,\" which is the proposed inference. Therefore, we can indeed make this inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
