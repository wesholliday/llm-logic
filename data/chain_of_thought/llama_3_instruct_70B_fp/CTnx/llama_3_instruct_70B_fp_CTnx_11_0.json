This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Blummed \u2192 Not Zimmed\". \n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was not blummed\", which can be represented as \"Zimmed \u2192 Not Blummed\". \n\nTo determine if we can make this inference, let's analyze the given statement. If the flug was blummed, it implies that it cannot be zimmed at the same time. This means that blummed and zimmed are mutually exclusive states for the flug. \n\nGiven this mutual exclusivity, if the flug was zimmed, it would imply that it cannot be blummed. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was not blummed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
