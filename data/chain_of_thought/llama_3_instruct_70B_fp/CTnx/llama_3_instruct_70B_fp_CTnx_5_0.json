This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"the zinger was fraggled\" and the consequent is \"the zinger was not smoogled\". \n\nTo infer the desired conclusion, \"If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled\", we need to swap the antecedent and consequent, and also swap the affirmative and negative forms of the predicates. This is a valid inference rule in logic, known as the contrapositive rule.\n\nThe contrapositive of \"If A, then not B\" is indeed \"If B, then not A\". In this case, A is \"the zinger was fraggled\" and B is \"the zinger was smoogled\". Therefore, we can infer the desired conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
