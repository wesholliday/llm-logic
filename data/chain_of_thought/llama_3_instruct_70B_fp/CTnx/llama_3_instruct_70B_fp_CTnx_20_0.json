            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it did not surn\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then not B\", where A is \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and B is \"it surned\".\n\nTo infer the new statement \"If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered\", we need to see if we can logically derive it from the original statement. This new statement can be represented as \"If B, then not A\".\n\nNotice that the original statement says that if A is true, then B must be false. This implies that if B is true, then A must be false. This is a classic case of contrapositive reasoning, where we swap the antecedent and consequent of the original statement and negate both.\n\nIn this case, we can indeed infer that if the fleeg surned (B), then it was not bluttered (not A). This is because the original statement guarantees that if the fleeg was bluttered (A), it did not surn (not B). Therefore, if it did surn (B), it must not have been bluttered (not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
