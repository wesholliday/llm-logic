            "content": "Explanation: Let's analyze the given statement: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled\". This statement implies that cranking the sprocket and dagling the sprocket are mutually exclusive events. In other words, if the sprocket is cranked, it cannot be daggled, and vice versa.\n\nNow, let's examine the proposed inference: \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\". This statement is essentially the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\", which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled\" is indeed \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\". Since the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
