The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was not varnished\" is indeed \"If the twonk was varnished, then it was not plinked.\"\n\nSince the contrapositive of a true statement is also true, we can conclude that the proposed inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
