            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat did not quank\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"M \u2192 \u00acQ\", where \"M\" means \"the splat was morphed\" and \"Q\" means \"the splat quank\".\n\nTo infer the new statement \"If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed\", we need to see if we can derive \"Q \u2192 \u00acM\" from the original statement.\n\nOne way to approach this is to use the rule of contrapositive, which states that \"P \u2192 Q\" is equivalent to \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\". In our case, we can apply this rule to the original statement \"M \u2192 \u00acQ\" to get \"\u00ac(\u00acQ) \u2192 \u00acM\", which simplifies to \"Q \u2192 \u00acM\".\n\nThis means that the new statement \"If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed\" is indeed a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
