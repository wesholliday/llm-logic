            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink\". This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and the consequent is \"the fribble did not crink\". \n\nWe can rewrite this statement in a more formal way using logical notation: Snurgled \u2192 \u00acCrink, where Snurgled represents \"the fribble was snurgled\" and Crink represents \"the fribble crink\". \n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\". In logical notation, this would be Crink \u2192 \u00acSnurgled. \n\nTo determine if we can make this inference, we can use the rule of contraposition, which states that if A \u2192 \u00acB, then B \u2192 \u00acA. In our case, we have Snurgled \u2192 \u00acCrink, and we want to know if we can infer Crink \u2192 \u00acSnurgled. \n\nUsing the rule of contraposition, we can see that the original statement Snurgled \u2192 \u00acCrink is equivalent to Crink \u2192 \u00acSnurgled. Therefore, we can indeed make the desired inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
