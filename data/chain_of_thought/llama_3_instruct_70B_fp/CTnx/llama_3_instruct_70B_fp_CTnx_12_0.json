            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint\". This is a conditional statement in the form of \"If A, then not B\". We can rewrite this as \"A \u2192 \u00acB\", where A is \"the smip was shripped\" and B is \"the smip lupped the zoint\".\n\nTo infer the desired conclusion, \"If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was not shripped\", we need to show that \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA. This is a classic case of contraposition, which states that if A \u2192 \u00acB, then \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA.\n\nIn other words, if we know that shripping the smip implies not lupping the zoint, then lupping the zoint must imply not shripping the smip. This is a valid logical inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
