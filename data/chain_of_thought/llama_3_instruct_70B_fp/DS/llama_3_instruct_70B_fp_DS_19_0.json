The watch isn't on his wrist.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are only two possible locations for the watch: on the dresser or on his wrist. \n\nNow, statement 2 tells us that the watch is not on his wrist. \n\nSince the watch can only be in one of the two locations, and it's not on his wrist, the only remaining possibility is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
