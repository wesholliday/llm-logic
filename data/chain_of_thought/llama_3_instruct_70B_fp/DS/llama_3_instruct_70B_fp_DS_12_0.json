It says that either the jacket is draped over the chair or it's hanging in the closet. This implies that these are the only two possible locations of the jacket.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the jacket isn't hanging in the closet. This means we can eliminate the second option from the first statement.\n\nSince the first statement says it's either one or the other, and we've eliminated the second option, we're left with only one possibility: the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
