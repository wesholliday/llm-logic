The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are only two possible locations for the scarf: either it's in the backpack or it's on the coat rack. \n\nNow, statement 2 tells us that the scarf is not on the coat rack. \n\nSince the scarf can't be on the coat rack (according to statement 2), and there are only two possible locations (according to statement 1), the only remaining possibility is that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
