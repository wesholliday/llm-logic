The first statement is a disjunction, which means it presents two possibilities: the keys are either in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet. This implies that these two possibilities are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that one of them must be true.\n\nThe second statement negates one of the possibilities presented in the first statement, namely, that the keys are dangling in the cabinet. This means that we can eliminate this possibility.\n\nSince the first statement presents two possibilities, and we have eliminated one of them, we are left with only one possibility: the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
