It says that either the remote control is on the coffee table or it's hiding under the couch. This implies that these are the only two possible locations for the remote control.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the remote control isn't hiding under the couch. This means we can eliminate the second option from the first statement.\n\nSince the first statement says it's either on the coffee table or under the couch, and we know it's not under the couch, the only remaining possibility is that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
