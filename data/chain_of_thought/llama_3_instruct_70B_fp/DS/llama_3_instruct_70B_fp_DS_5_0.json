The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are only two possible locations for the cookies: the jar or the pantry. \n\nNow, statement 2 tells us that the cookies are not in the pantry. \n\nSince the cookies can't be in the pantry (according to statement 2), and there are only two possible locations (according to statement 1), the only remaining possibility is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
