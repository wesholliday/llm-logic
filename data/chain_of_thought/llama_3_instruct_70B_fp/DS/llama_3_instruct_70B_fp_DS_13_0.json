The toy isn't sitting on the shelf.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are only two possible locations for the toy: the toy box or the shelf. \n\nNow, statement 2 tells us that the toy is not on the shelf. \n\nSince the toy can't be on the shelf (according to statement 2), and there are only two possible locations (according to statement 1), the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
