(This is an \"or\" statement, which means that at least one of the options must be true.)\n2. The book isn't resting on the table. (This statement tells us that one of the options in the first premise is false.)\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities. If the book isn't resting on the table, then the only other option left is that the book is on the shelf. This is because the first premise states that it must be one or the other.\n\nAnswer: yes",
