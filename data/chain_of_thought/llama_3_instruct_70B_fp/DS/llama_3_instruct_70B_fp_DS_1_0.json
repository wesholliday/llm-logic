It doesn't necessarily mean that both options are true, but at least one of them is.\n\n2. \"Fido is not in the garden\" - This statement tells us that the second option in the \"or\" statement is false.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince \"Fido is not in the garden\" is true, the only remaining option in the \"or\" statement is \"Fido is inside\". If the \"or\" statement is true, and one of the options is false, then the other option must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
