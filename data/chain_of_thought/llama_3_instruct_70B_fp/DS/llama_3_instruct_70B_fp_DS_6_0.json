It's an \"either-or\" situation.\n\n2. \"The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen\" - This statement tells us that the second scenario mentioned in statement 1 is not true. The phone is not ringing in the kitchen.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation: We know that there are only two possible scenarios (phone in living room or phone ringing in kitchen), and we've eliminated the second scenario (phone ringing in kitchen). This means that the only remaining possibility is that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes",
