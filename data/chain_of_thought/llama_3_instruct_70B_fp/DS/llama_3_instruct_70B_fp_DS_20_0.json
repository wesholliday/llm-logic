The first statement is a disjunction, which means it presents two possibilities: either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are perched on her head. This statement implies that these two possibilities are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that one of them must be true.\n\nThe second statement negates one of the possibilities presented in the first statement, namely, that the sunglasses are perched on her head. This means that we can eliminate this possibility.\n\nNow, we are left with only one possibility from the original disjunction, which is that the sunglasses are in her bag. Since the disjunction presented two mutually exclusive and exhaustive possibilities, and we have eliminated one of them, we can infer that the remaining possibility must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
