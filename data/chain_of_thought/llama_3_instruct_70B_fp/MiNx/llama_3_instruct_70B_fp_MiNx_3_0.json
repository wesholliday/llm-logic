This is equivalent to saying that it's not certain that the splat was morphed. \n\nNow, let's analyze the statement \"It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed\". This statement is saying that it's not necessary or certain that the splat was morphed. \n\nComparing the two statements, we can see that they are conveying the same idea - that it's not certain or necessary that the splat was morphed. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
