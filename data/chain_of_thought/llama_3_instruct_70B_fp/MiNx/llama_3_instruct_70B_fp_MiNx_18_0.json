This means that we cannot be certain that the shank was plooked. \n\nNow, let's analyze the statement we want to infer: \"It's not the case that the shank must have been plooked\". This statement is saying that it's not necessary or certain that the shank was plooked. \n\nSince the original statement already implies that we cannot be certain that the shank was plooked, it aligns with the idea that it's not the case that the shank must have been plooked. \n\nAnswer: yes",
