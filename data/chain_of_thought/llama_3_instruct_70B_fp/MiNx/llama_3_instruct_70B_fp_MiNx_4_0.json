This statement implies that there is a possibility that the fribble was not snurgled. In other words, it's not certain that the fribble was snurgled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statement we're trying to infer: \"It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled\". This statement is saying that it's not necessarily true that the fribble had to be snurgled.\n\nSince the original statement implies that there's a possibility the fribble wasn't snurgled, it means that it's not necessarily true that the fribble had to be snurgled. This aligns with the statement we're trying to infer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
