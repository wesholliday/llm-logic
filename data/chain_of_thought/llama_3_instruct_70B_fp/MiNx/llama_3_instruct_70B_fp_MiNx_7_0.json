This is equivalent to saying that it's not certain that the whiffle was shanked.\n\nTo infer \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked\", we need to determine if the original statement implies that it's impossible or uncertain that the whiffle must have been shanked.\n\nSince \"might not have been shanked\" implies uncertainty, it's reasonable to conclude that it's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked. If it must have been shanked, then there would be no possibility of it not being shanked, which contradicts the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
