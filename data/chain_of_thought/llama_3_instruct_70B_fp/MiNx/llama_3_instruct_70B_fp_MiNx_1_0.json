This statement implies that there is a possibility that the flugel was not blimmed. In other words, it's not certain that the flugel was blimmed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statement we want to infer: \"It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed\". This statement is equivalent to saying that it's not necessary or certain that the flugel was blimmed.\n\nSince the original statement \"The flugel might not have been blimmed\" implies that it's not certain that the flugel was blimmed, it aligns with the idea that it's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed. In other words, the uncertainty or possibility of the flugel not being blimmed is consistent with the idea that it's not necessary or certain that the flugel was blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
