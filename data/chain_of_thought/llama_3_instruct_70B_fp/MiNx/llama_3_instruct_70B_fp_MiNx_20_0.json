In other words, the negation of \"the fleeg was bluttered\" is considered possible.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statement we want to infer: \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered\". This statement is equivalent to saying \"the fleeg doesn't necessarily have to be bluttered\" or \"it's not necessary that the fleeg was bluttered\".\n\nIf we consider the original statement, \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered\", it implies that there's a possibility that the fleeg was not bluttered. This means that it's not necessary for the fleeg to be bluttered, which aligns with the statement we want to infer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
