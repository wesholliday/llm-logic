In other words, it's not certain that the flug was blummed.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed\". This statement is saying that it's not necessary or certain that the flug was blummed.\n\nSince the original statement \"The flug might not have been blummed\" implies that it's not certain that the flug was blummed, it aligns with the idea that \"It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed\". In other words, if there's a possibility that the flug was not blummed, then it's not necessary or certain that it was blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
