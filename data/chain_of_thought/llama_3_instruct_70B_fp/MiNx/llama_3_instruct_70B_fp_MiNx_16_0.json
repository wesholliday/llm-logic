In other words, it's not certain that the sneg was crampled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statement we want to infer: \"It's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled\". This statement is equivalent to saying that it's not necessarily true that the sneg was crampled. This is consistent with the original statement, which suggests that there's a possibility the sneg was not crampled.\n\nIn essence, the original statement is saying that it's possible the sneg wasn't crampled, and the statement we want to infer is saying that it's not necessarily true that the sneg was crampled. These two statements are logically consistent, and the second statement can be inferred from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
