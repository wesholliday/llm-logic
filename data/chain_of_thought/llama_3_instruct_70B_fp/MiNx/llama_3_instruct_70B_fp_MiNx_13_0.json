Now, let's analyze the statement we want to infer: \"It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged\". This statement is equivalent to saying \"The glip doesn't necessarily have to be slogged\" or \"The glip might not have been slogged\". \n\nNotice that both statements convey the same meaning - that it's possible the glip was not slogged. Since the original statement already implies this possibility, we can indeed infer the desired statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
