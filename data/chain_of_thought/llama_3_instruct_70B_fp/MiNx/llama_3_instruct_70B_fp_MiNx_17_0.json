In other words, it's not certain that the flob was skizzled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statement we're trying to infer: \"It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled\". This statement is equivalent to saying that it's not necessarily true that the flob was skizzled.\n\nSince the original statement \"The flob might not have been skizzled\" implies that there's a possibility the flob was not skizzled, it directly supports the idea that it's not necessarily true that the flob was skizzled. Therefore, we can infer the desired statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
