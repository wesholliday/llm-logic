This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"the book was written by James\" and the consequent is \"the book is a mystery novel\". \n\nNow, let's analyze the proposed inference: \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James\". This is also a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"the book is not a mystery novel\" and the consequent is \"the book was not written by James\". \n\nNotice that the antecedent and consequent of the original statement are swapped in the proposed inference, and also negated. This is a classic pattern in logic, known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by swapping the antecedent and consequent, and negating both. \n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the original statement is indeed \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James\". This means that the proposed inference is logically equivalent to the original statement, and therefore it is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
