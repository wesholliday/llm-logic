This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal\". \n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\" from the original statement. This new statement can be represented as \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\", where \u00acQ is \"the truck was not metal\" and \u00acP is \"the doll was not plastic\". \n\nTo determine if we can make this inference, we can use the rule of contrapositive, which states that \"P \u2192 Q\" is equivalent to \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\". This means that if the original statement is true, then the new statement must also be true. \n\nAnswer: yes",
