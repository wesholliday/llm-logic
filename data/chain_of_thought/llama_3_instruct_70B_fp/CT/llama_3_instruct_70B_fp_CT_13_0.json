            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue\". \n\nNow, let's analyze the proposed inference: \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\". This can be represented as \"If not Q, then not P\". \n\nWe can use the concept of contrapositive to evaluate this inference. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\", which is always true if the original statement is true. \n\nIn this case, the original statement is \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\", and the proposed inference is the contrapositive of this statement, which is \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\". \n\nSince the contrapositive of a true statement is always true, we can infer that the proposed statement is indeed true if the original statement is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
