            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball\". This statement implies that if Tom watched football, then it must be the case that Jen watched basketball. \n\nTo determine if we can infer the converse statement \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\", we need to examine the logical structure of the original statement. \n\nIn particular, we can use the rule of inference called \"modus tollens\", which states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, then we can conclude that P must also be false. \n\nIn this case, if we know that Jen did not watch basketball (i.e., Q is false), then we can use modus tollens to conclude that Tom did not watch football (i.e., P is false). \n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer the converse statement \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
