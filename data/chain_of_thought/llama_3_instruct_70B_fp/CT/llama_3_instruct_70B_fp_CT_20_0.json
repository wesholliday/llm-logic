            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can make this inference, let's analyze the original statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\nThe inference we're asked to consider is \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\" This can be represented as \"If not Q, then not P.\" \n\nIn logic, this type of inference is called the contrapositive, which is a valid inference rule. The contrapositive states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q,\" we can infer \"If not Q, then not P.\" \n\nIn this case, we can apply the contrapositive rule to the original statement. Since the original statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,\" we can infer \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
