            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry\". \n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\" from the original statement. This new statement can be represented as \"If not Q, then not P\". \n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we can use the concept of contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\", which is always true if the original statement is true. \n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the original statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is indeed \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\". \n\nAnswer: yes",
