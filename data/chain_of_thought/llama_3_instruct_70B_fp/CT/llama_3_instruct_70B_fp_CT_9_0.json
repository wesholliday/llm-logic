This implies that if P is true, then Q must also be true. \n\nTo determine if we can infer the converse statement \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\", we need to examine the logical structure of the original statement. \n\nThe converse statement is of the form \"If not Q, then not P\". This is a valid inference, known as the contrapositive, which is a fundamental principle in logic. It states that if Q is false, then P must also be false, because if P were true, then Q would have to be true as well.\n\nAnswer: yes",
