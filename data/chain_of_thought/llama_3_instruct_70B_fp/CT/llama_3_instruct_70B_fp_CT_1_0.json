            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\". This implies that Mary's presence at the wedding is a sufficient condition for Sue's presence. In other words, if Mary is at the wedding, we can be certain that Sue is also at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's examine the proposed inference: \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\". This statement is saying that if Sue is not at the wedding, then Mary must not be at the wedding either.\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we can use a logical contrapositive argument. The contrapositive of the original statement is \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\", which is exactly the proposed inference.\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true. In this case, the contrapositive is the proposed inference, which means it is indeed a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
