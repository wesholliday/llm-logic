            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"the dog was inside\" and Q is \"the cat was outside\".\n\nTo infer the new statement \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside\", we need to see if it follows logically from the original statement. This new statement can be represented as \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\", where \u00acQ is \"the cat was not outside\" and \u00acP is \"the dog was not inside\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship between the original statement and the new statement. If P \u2192 Q is true, then it means that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. In other words, if the dog is inside, the cat must be outside.\n\nIf we negate Q (\u00acQ), it means the cat is not outside. In this case, we can conclude that P must also be false (\u00acP), because if the cat is not outside, the dog cannot be inside (since the original statement P \u2192 Q is true).\n\nTherefore, the new statement \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP logically follows from the original statement P \u2192 Q.\n\nAnswer: yes",
