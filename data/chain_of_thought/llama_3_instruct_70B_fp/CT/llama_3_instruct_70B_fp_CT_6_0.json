This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Sue chose pizza \u2192 Bob chose pasta\". \n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\" from the original statement. This new statement can be represented as \"Bob did not choose pasta \u2192 Sue did not choose pizza\". \n\nTo determine if we can make this inference, let's analyze the original statement. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. This means that if Bob did not choose pasta, it's possible that Sue did not choose pizza. \n\nHowever, we need to be careful here. The original statement only tells us what happens if Sue chooses pizza, but it doesn't tell us what happens if Sue doesn't choose pizza. \n\nFortunately, we can use a logical rule called contraposition to help us. Contraposition states that if we have a conditional statement \"A \u2192 B\", we can infer the statement \"not B \u2192 not A\". \n\nIn our case, we can apply contraposition to the original statement \"Sue chose pizza \u2192 Bob chose pasta\" to get \"Bob did not choose pasta \u2192 Sue did not choose pizza\". \n\nAnswer: yes",
