            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim\". \n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\" from the original statement. This new statement can be represented as \"If not Q, then not P\". \n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we can use the concept of contrapositive. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\", which is always true if the original statement is true. \n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the original statement is indeed \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\". Therefore, we can infer this statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
