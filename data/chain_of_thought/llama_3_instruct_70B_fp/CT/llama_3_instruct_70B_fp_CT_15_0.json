            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin took a train\". \n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane\". This can be represented as \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\", where \u00acQ is \"Erin did not take a train\" and \u00acP is \"Sam did not take a plane\". \n\nTo determine if we can make this inference, we can use the rule of contrapositive, which states that \"P \u2192 Q\" is equivalent to \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\". In other words, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive statement must also be true. \n\nSince the original statement is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\", we can apply the rule of contrapositive to infer \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
