This implies that if Alex finished the race, it is certain that Chris also finished the race. In other words, Alex finishing the race is a sufficient condition for Chris to finish the race.\n\nNow, let's examine the proposed inference: \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race\". This statement is saying that if Chris did not finish the race, it is certain that Alex did not finish the race either. In other words, Chris not finishing the race is a sufficient condition for Alex not to finish the race.\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we need to check if the original statement implies the proposed inference. If Alex finishing the race guarantees Chris finishing the race, then it's reasonable to conclude that if Chris did not finish the race, Alex must not have finished the race either. This is because if Alex had finished the race, Chris would have finished the race as well, but since Chris did not finish, Alex cannot have finished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
