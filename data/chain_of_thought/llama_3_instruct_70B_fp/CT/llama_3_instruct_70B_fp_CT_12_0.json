            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo\". This statement implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. \n\nTo determine if we can infer the converse statement \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\", we need to examine the logical structure of the original statement. \n\nIn a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\", the negation of Q implies the negation of P. This is a fundamental principle of logic, often referred to as modus tollens. \n\nIn this case, the negation of Q is \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\", and the negation of P is \"Joe did not go to the park\". \n\nTherefore, if we apply modus tollens to the original statement, we can indeed infer that if Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
