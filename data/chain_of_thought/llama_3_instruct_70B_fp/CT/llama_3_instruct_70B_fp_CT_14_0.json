            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the original statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\". This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q is \"the wolf was in the den\".\n\nTo determine if we can infer the new statement \"If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave\", we need to examine the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"P \u2192 Q\" is \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\", where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the wolf was not in the den (\u00acQ), then the bear was not in the cave (\u00acP)\". This is exactly the new statement we're trying to infer.\n\nSince the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always true if the original statement is true, we can conclude that the new statement is indeed a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
