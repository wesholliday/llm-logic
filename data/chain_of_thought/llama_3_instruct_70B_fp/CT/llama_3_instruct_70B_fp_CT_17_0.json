This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Ben ate pasta \u2192 Kate ate the salad\". \n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\" from the original statement. This new statement can be represented as \"\u00ac(Kate ate the salad) \u2192 \u00ac(Ben ate pasta)\". \n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we can use the rule of contrapositive, which states that \"p \u2192 q\" is equivalent to \"\u00acq \u2192 \u00acp\". \n\nIn our case, \"p\" is \"Ben ate pasta\" and \"q\" is \"Kate ate the salad\". Applying the rule of contrapositive, we get \"\u00ac(Kate ate the salad) \u2192 \u00ac(Ben ate pasta)\", which is exactly the statement we want to infer. \n\nTherefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
