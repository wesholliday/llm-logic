This statement implies that the frazzle can be either frazzle or gribble, but it must be one of these two options. \n\nIn other words, the frazzle cannot be anything else except frazzle or gribble. \n\nNow, if the frazzle must be either frazzle or gribble, it is certainly possible that the frazzle is frazzle. \n\nTherefore, we can infer that the frazzle must be frazzle.\n\nAnswer: yes",
