This statement is saying that the frazzle must be plimp for either a frazzle or a zizz. In other words, it's saying that the frazzle being plimp is a necessary condition for it to be either a frazzle or a zizz. \n\nNow, if the frazzle being plimp is necessary for it to be a frazzle or a zizz, then it's also necessary for it to be just a frazzle, since being a frazzle is one of the possibilities. Therefore, we can conclude that the frazzle must be plimp for a frazzle.\n\nAnswer: yes",
