This statement implies that the glorp can be either wozzle frazzle or blurble, or possibly both. \n\nIn order to infer \"The glorp must be wozzle frazzle\", we would need to eliminate the possibility of the glorp being blurble. However, the original statement does not provide any information that would allow us to rule out the possibility of the glorp being blurble. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the glorp must be wozzle frazzle, because it might still be blurble.\n\nAnswer: no",
