We know that \u00acS is true, and we also know that S \u2228 B is true. Since S is false (due to \u00acS), the only way S \u2228 B can be true is if B is true. This is because a disjunction (OR statement) is true if at least one of its components is true. In this case, S is false, so B must be true to make the disjunction true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
