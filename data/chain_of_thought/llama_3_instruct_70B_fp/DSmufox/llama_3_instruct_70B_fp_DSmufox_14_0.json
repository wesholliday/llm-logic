In other words, it's not necessary for the clug to be snugged.\n\n2. \"Either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked\" - This statement presents two possibilities: either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked. \n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. Since the first statement negates the necessity of the clug being snugged, we can conclude that the clug must not be snugged. \n\nGiven the second statement, if the clug must not be snugged, then the only remaining possibility is that it is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
