In other words, it's not necessary for the wug to be garpled.\n\n2. \"Either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged\" - This statement presents two possibilities: either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged. Since we know from statement 1 that the wug doesn't have to be garpled, the only remaining possibility is that it is sproinged.\n\nBy combining these two statements, we can conclude that the wug is sproinged, as it's the only option left after eliminating the possibility of the wug being garpled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
