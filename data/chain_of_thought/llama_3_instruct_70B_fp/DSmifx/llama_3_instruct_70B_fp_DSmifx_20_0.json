It's an \"either-or\" situation.\n\n2. \"The fleeg might not be surned\" - This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the fleeg is not surned.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the fleeg might not be surned, then according to the first statement, the only other possibility is that it is bluttered. This is because the first statement presents an exclusive \"either-or\" scenario, and if one option (surned) is not the case, then the other option (bluttered) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
