It's an \"either-or\" situation.\n\n2. \"The splat might not be quanked\" - This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the splat is not quanked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the splat might not be quanked, and we know that there are only two possible scenarios (quanked or morphed), then the only other possibility is that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
