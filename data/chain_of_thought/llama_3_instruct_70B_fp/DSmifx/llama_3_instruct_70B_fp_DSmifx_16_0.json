It's an \"either-or\" situation.\n\n2. \"The sneg might not be sproted\" - This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the sneg is not sproted.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the sneg might not be sproted, and we know that either it must be sproted or it is crampled, then the only other possibility is that it is crampled. This is because the first statement eliminates any other options beyond \"sproted\" and \"crampled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
