It's an \"either-or\" situation.\n\n2. \"The twonk might not be plinked\" - This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the twonk is not plinked.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. If the twonk might not be plinked, and we know that either it's varnished or plinked, then the only remaining possibility is that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
