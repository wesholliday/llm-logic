It's an \"either-or\" situation.\n\n2. \"The glip might not be tragged\" - This statement tells us that it's possible that the glip is not tragged.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the glip might not be tragged, and we know that either it's tragged or it's slogged, then the only other possibility is that it's slogged. This is because the first statement eliminates any other options besides tragged or slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
