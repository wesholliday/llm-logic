It's an \"either-or\" situation.\n\n2. \"The whiffle might not be tinked\" - This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the whiffle is not tinked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the whiffle might not be tinked, and we know that either it must be tinked or it is shanked, then the only other possibility is that the whiffle is shanked. This is because the first statement eliminates any other options beyond \"tinked\" or \"shanked\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
