It's an \"either-or\" situation.\n\n2. \"The clug might not be snugged\" - This statement suggests that it's possible that the clug is not snugged.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the clug might not be snugged, and we know that either it must be snugged or it is fleeked, then the only other possibility is that it is fleeked. This is because the first statement eliminates any other options besides \"snugged\" and \"fleeked\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
