            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"M \u2192 S\", where M represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S represents \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n2. \"Sue was at the wedding\" - This is a simple statement, which can be represented as \"S\".\n\nTo deduce \"Mary was at the wedding\" (M), we need to examine the implications of the given statements. From statement 1, we know that if M is true, then S must also be true. However, this does not necessarily mean that if S is true, then M must also be true. There could be other reasons why S is true, unrelated to M.\n\nIn this case, we are given that S is true, but we cannot logically conclude that M must be true. There is not enough information to establish a direct connection between S being true and M being true.\n\nAnswer: no",
