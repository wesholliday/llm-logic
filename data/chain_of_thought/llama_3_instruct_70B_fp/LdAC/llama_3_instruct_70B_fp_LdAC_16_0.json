            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We have a conditional statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" which can be represented as \"If A, then B\" or \"A \u2192 B\". We also know that \"The pants were denim\" which is equivalent to \"B\".\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can logically deduce \"The shirt was cotton\" which is equivalent to \"A\". \n\nIn a conditional statement \"A \u2192 B\", if we know \"B\" is true, it does not necessarily mean \"A\" is true. There could be other reasons why \"B\" is true. For example, the pants could be denim even if the shirt is not cotton.\n\nAnswer: no",
