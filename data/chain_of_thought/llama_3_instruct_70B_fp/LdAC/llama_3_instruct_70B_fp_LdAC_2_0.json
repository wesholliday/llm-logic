The unicorn was in the forest (assertion)\n\nWe want to deduce whether the griffin was in the forest. To do this, we can use modus ponens, a valid inference rule in logic.\n\nModus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn our case, the conditional statement is \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\". We are given that the unicorn was in the forest (Q is true), but we don't know for sure that the griffin was in the forest (P is not explicitly stated to be true).\n\nSince we don't have direct evidence that the griffin was in the forest, we cannot apply modus ponens to conclude that the griffin was in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no",
