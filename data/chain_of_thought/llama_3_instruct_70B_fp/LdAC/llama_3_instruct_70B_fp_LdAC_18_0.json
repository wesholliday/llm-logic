            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal\".\n2. \"The truck was metal\" - This is a statement that affirms Q.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can logically deduce \"The doll was plastic\" (P) from these two statements.\n\nIn a conditional statement \"P \u2192 Q\", if Q is true, it does not necessarily mean that P is true. There could be other reasons why Q is true. For example, the truck could be metal regardless of the doll's material.\n\nIn this case, we only know that the truck is metal, but we don't have any information about the doll's material. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce that the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: no",
