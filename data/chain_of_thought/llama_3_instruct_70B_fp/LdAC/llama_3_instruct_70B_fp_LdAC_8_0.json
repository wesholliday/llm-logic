            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"V \u2192 M\", where V represents \"the vampire was awake\" and M represents \"the mummy was awake\".\n2. \"The mummy was awake\" - This is a simple statement, which can be represented as \"M\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must be awake. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the mummy is awake, the vampire must be awake. There could be other reasons why the mummy is awake.\n\nGiven the second statement, we know that the mummy is indeed awake. But we cannot conclude that the vampire is awake solely based on this information. The first statement only guarantees that if the vampire is awake, the mummy will be awake, but it does not provide a guarantee in the reverse direction.\n\nAnswer: no",
