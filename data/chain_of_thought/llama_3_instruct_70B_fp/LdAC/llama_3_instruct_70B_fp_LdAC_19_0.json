However, this does not necessarily mean that the antecedent \"Tom watched football\" is true.\n\nIn other words, just because Jen watched basketball, it doesn't guarantee that Tom watched football. There could be other reasons why Jen watched basketball, unrelated to Tom watching football.\n\nAnswer: no",
