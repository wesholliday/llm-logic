However, we cannot directly infer the converse, which is \"If the doll was not plastic (not P), then the truck was not metal (not Q)\". \n\nTo determine the relationship between \"not P\" and \"not Q\", we would need more information or additional statements. The given statement only provides a one-way implication, and we cannot assume a direct connection between the negations of P and Q.\n\nAnswer: no",
