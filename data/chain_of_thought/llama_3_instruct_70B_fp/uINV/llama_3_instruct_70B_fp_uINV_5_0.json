            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is an implication, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis\". This implication does not provide any information about what happens when P is false, i.e., when Jeff did not play basketball. \n\nIn logic, an implication \"If P, then Q\" does not necessarily imply \"If not P, then not Q\". This is because the original implication only guarantees that Q is true when P is true, but it does not provide any information about the relationship between not P and not Q.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis, based solely on the original implication.\n\nAnswer: no",
