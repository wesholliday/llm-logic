This implies that if Mary is present, then Sue must also be present. However, it does not provide any information about the situation where Mary is not present. \n\nIn logic, the converse of an implication is not necessarily true. The converse of \"If Mary, then Sue\" would be \"If not Mary, then not Sue\", but we cannot infer this from the original statement. There might be cases where Mary is not present, but Sue is still present.\n\nAnswer: no",
