However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the car is not red. \n\nIn particular, it does not guarantee that if the car is not red, the truck must not be blue. There could be cases where the car is not red, but the truck is still blue. \n\nTherefore, we cannot make a definitive inference about the color of the truck based on the car not being red.\n\nAnswer: no",
