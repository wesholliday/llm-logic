This is equivalent to asking if the converse of the original statement is true, i.e., \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\", where \u00acP is \"Sam did not take a plane\" and \u00acQ is \"Erin did not take a train\". \n\nHowever, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. In this case, we can't conclude that if Sam didn't take a plane, Erin didn't take a train. There might be other reasons why Erin took a train, and Sam's mode of transportation is not relevant to Erin's decision.\n\nAnswer: no",
