This implication does not provide any information about what happens when P is false, i.e., when Tom did not watch football. \n\nIn logic, this type of implication only guarantees the truth of Q when P is true, but it does not provide any information about the truth of Q when P is false. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
