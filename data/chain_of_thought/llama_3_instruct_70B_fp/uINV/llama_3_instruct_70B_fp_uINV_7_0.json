This implies that whenever A is true, B is also true. However, it does not provide any information about what happens when A is false. \n\nIn particular, it does not guarantee that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race. There could be cases where Alex did not finish, but Chris still finished. \n\nTo make a valid inference, we would need more information or a different type of statement, such as \"If and only if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\". \n\nAnswer: no",
