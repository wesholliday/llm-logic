However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the cake was not chocolate. \n\nIn particular, it does not guarantee that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry. There could be other possibilities, such as the muffins being blueberry even if the cake was not chocolate, or the muffins being a different flavor altogether.\n\nAnswer: no",
