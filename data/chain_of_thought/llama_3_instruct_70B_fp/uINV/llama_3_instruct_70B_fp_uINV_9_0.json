            "content": "Explanation: Let's analyze the given statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\". \n\nFrom this statement, we can infer that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, we cannot make any conclusions about Q if P is false. In other words, if Lisa did not buy the red shirt (P is false), we cannot determine whether Mark bought the blue shirt (Q) or not. \n\nThe given statement only provides information about the situation when Lisa buys the red shirt, but it does not provide any information about the situation when Lisa does not buy the red shirt. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
