However, it does not provide any information about what happens when the apple is not red. \n\nIn particular, it does not guarantee that if the apple is not red, then the banana must not be yellow. There could be cases where the apple is not red, but the banana is still yellow. \n\nTherefore, we cannot make a definitive conclusion about the color of the banana based solely on the fact that the apple is not red.\n\nAnswer: no",
