However, it does not provide any information about what happens when A is false. \n\nIn this case, we know that if Sue chose pizza (A), then Bob chose pasta (B). But we cannot infer anything about Bob's choice when Sue did not choose pizza. There might be cases where Sue did not choose pizza, but Bob still chose pasta, or cases where Sue did not choose pizza and Bob did not choose pasta. \n\nThe correct inference would be that if Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza, which is the contrapositive of the original statement. But we cannot make any conclusions about Bob's choice when Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: no",
