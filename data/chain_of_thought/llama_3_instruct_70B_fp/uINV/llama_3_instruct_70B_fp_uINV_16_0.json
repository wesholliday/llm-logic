However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the shirt is not cotton. \n\nIn particular, it does not guarantee that if the shirt is not cotton, then the pants are not denim. There might be cases where the shirt is not cotton, but the pants are still denim, or the pants are not denim. \n\nWe cannot make a definitive conclusion about the pants being not denim just because the shirt is not cotton.\n\nAnswer: no",
