The statement does not provide any information about which alternative is true, only that one of them must be true. \n\nIf the flibbit is zibble wozzle, then the statement is true, but we cannot conclude that it must be in plonk. However, if the flibbit is not zibble wozzle, then the only way the statement can be true is if the flibbit is in plonk. \n\nSo, while we cannot be certain that the flibbit must be in plonk, we can infer that if it is not zibble wozzle, then it must be in plonk. But we do not have enough information to conclude that it must be in plonk in all cases.\n\nAnswer: no",
