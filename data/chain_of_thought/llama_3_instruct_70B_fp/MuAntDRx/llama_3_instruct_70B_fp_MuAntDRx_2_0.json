This is a disjunctive statement, meaning it presents two possibilities: the wozzle is on the blimp, or the wozzle is in the plimp. \n\nTo infer \"The wozzle must be in the plimp\", we would need to eliminate the possibility that the wozzle is on the blimp. However, the original statement does not provide any information that would allow us to do so. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the wozzle must be in the plimp, because it is still possible that the wozzle is on the blimp.\n\nAnswer: no",
