This statement implies that the blimple has two possible locations: either it is at zooble grazzle or it is blimple. \n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"The blimple must be blimple\" from this statement. To do this, we need to examine the possibilities. If the blimple is at zooble grazzle, then it is not necessarily blimple. However, if it is not at zooble grazzle, then it must be blimple (since these are the only two options given). \n\nSo, we can't conclude with absolute certainty that the blimple must be blimple, because it might be at zooble grazzle instead. But we can say that if it's not at zooble grazzle, then it must be blimple.\n\nAnswer: no",
