This is a disjunctive statement, meaning it presents two alternatives: \"The blurble must be plonk\" or \"The blurble must be on blimple\". \n\nTo infer \"The blurble must be on blimple\", we would need to eliminate the possibility of \"The blurble must be plonk\". However, the original statement does not provide any information that would allow us to do so. \n\nIn other words, the original statement only tells us that one of the two alternatives must be true, but it does not give us any information about which one is true. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The blurble must be on blimple\" is the only possibility.\n\nAnswer: no",
