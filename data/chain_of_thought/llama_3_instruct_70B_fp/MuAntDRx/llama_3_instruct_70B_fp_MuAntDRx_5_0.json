This statement implies that the wibble can be either flibbit wozzle or blimple, but it must be one of these two options. \n\nIn other words, the statement is saying that if the wibble is not flibbit wozzle, then it must be blimple, and if it's not blimple, then it must be flibbit wozzle. \n\nSo, if we know that the wibble is not flibbit wozzle, we can conclude that it must be blimple. However, if we don't have any additional information, we can't infer that the wibble must be blimple because it could still be flibbit wozzle.\n\nAnswer: no",
