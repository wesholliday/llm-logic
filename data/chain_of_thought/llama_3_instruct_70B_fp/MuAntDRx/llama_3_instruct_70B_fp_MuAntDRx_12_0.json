This statement implies that the wobble must be floob, and it can be floob in one of two ways: either by wozzle or by crunk. However, it does not directly state that the wobble must be crunk. \n\nTo infer \"The wobble must be crunk\", we would need additional information that rules out the possibility of the wobble being floob by wozzle. Without such information, we cannot conclude that the wobble must be crunk.\n\nAnswer: no",
