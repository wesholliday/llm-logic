This statement implies that if the zump is quimble, then it can be either a shimble or a blimp. However, it does not directly imply that the zump must be a blimp. The \"or\" in the statement suggests that the zump can be either a shimble or a blimp, but it does not provide a direct connection between the zump being quimble and the zump being a blimp.\n\nAnswer: no",
