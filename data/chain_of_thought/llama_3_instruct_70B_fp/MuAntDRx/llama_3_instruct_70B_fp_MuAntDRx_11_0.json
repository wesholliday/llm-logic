This statement implies that the snizzle can be either quank or quazzle, but it does not provide any information about which one is more likely or possible. \n\nTo infer \"The snizzle must be quazzle\", we would need additional information that rules out the possibility of the snizzle being quank. However, the original statement does not provide such information. \n\nTherefore, based on the given statement alone, we cannot infer that \"The snizzle must be quazzle\".\n\nAnswer: no",
