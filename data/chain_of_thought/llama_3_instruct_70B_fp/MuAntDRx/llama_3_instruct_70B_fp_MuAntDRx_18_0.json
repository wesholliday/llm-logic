This sentence is in the form of \"A must be B or C\", where A is \"The frazzle\", B is \"snork with gribble\", and C is \"on an blimple grooble\". \n\nIn logic, \"or\" is an inclusive operator, meaning that if A is true, then either B or C (or both) must be true. Therefore, if \"The frazzle must be snork with gribble or on an blimple grooble\" is true, then it is possible that \"The frazzle must be on an blimple grooble\" is true, because it is one of the options.\n\nAnswer: yes",
