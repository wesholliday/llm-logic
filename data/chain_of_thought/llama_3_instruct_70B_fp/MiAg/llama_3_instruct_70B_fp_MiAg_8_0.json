These statements indicate that there is a possibility of the restaurant being expensive and a possibility of the restaurant being busy. However, they do not necessarily imply that both conditions will occur simultaneously. \n\nTo infer \"The restaurant might be expensive and busy\", we would need to know that the two possibilities are linked, i.e., if the restaurant is expensive, it is also busy, or if the restaurant is busy, it is also expensive. But the given statements do not provide such information. They only provide individual possibilities.\n\nAnswer: no",
