This statement suggests that the keys are both in the drawer and on a keychain simultaneously.\n\nHowever, the original statements do not provide any information about the relationship between the keys being in the drawer and being on a keychain. It's possible that the keys are either in the drawer or on a keychain, but not necessarily both at the same time.\n\nAnswer: no",
