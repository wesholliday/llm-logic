This statement combines the two possibilities mentioned above. It suggests that there is a possibility that the scientist is both in the lab and conducting an experiment.\n\nSince the original statements only provide individual possibilities, we can't be certain that both conditions are true simultaneously. However, we can't rule out the possibility either. Therefore, we can infer that it's possible that the scientist is conducting an experiment in the lab, but we can't be certain.\n\nAnswer: yes",
