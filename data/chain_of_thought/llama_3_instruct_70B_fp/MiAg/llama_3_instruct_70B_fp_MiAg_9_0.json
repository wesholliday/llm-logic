If the package is delivered today, it's possible that it might be damaged. The fact that the package might be damaged doesn't necessarily mean it will be delivered today, but if it is delivered today, it's possible that it will be damaged.\n\nThe question is whether we can infer \"The package might be delivered damaged today\". This statement implies that there is a possibility that the package will be delivered today and it will be damaged.\n\nGiven the original statements, we can conclude that if the package is delivered today, it's possible that it will be damaged. Therefore, it's reasonable to infer that there is a possibility that the package will be delivered damaged today.\n\nAnswer: yes",
