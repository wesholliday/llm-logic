This statement combines the two possibilities mentioned above. It suggests that there is a possibility that the cat is both in the garden and sleeping.\n\nSince the original statements only provide individual possibilities, we can't be certain that the cat is both in the garden and sleeping. However, we can't rule it out either, because both possibilities are mentioned separately. Therefore, it's reasonable to infer that there is a possibility that the cat might be sleeping in the garden, as it's a combination of the two individual possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes",
