This statement combines the two possibilities: the flowers being in the vase and the flowers being wilting. \n\nSince we know that there is a possibility that the flowers are in the vase (from statement 1) and a possibility that the flowers are wilting (from statement 2), it is reasonable to conclude that there is a possibility that the flowers are wilting in the vase. This is because both conditions (being in the vase and wilting) might be true simultaneously.\n\nAnswer: yes",
