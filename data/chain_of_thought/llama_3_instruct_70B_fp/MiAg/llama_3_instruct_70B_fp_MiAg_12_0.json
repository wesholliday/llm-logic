This statement tells us that there are two possibilities: the computer might be on, and the computer might be running a virus scan. However, it does not guarantee that both conditions are true at the same time. \n\nTo infer \"The computer might be on and running a virus scan\", we need to ensure that both conditions can occur simultaneously. Since the original statement does not provide any information about the relationship between the computer being on and running a virus scan, we cannot be certain that both conditions will occur together.\n\nAnswer: no",
