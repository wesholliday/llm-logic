We know that \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is true, which means that if Alex finished the race, it necessarily implies that Chris finished the race. We also know that \"Chris finished the race\" is true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. Since \"Chris finished the race\" is true, and we know that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race, it seems reasonable to conclude that Alex finished the race. However, we need to be careful here. The original statement only guarantees that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the converse is true (i.e., if Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race).\n\nIn other words, just because Chris finished the race, it doesn't necessarily mean that Alex finished the race. There could be other reasons why Chris finished the race that have nothing to do with Alex.\n\nAnswer: no",
