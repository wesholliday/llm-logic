We know that \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is true, which means that if the condition \"Joe went to the park\" is true, then the consequence \"Lucy went to the zoo\" must also be true. We also know that \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is indeed true. However, this does not necessarily mean that \"Joe went to the park\" is true. \n\nThere could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo, not just because Joe went to the park. The original statement only guarantees that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo, but it does not exclude other possibilities. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"Joe went to the park\" is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
