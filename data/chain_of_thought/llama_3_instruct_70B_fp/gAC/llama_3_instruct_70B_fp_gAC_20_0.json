We know that \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is true, which means that if the apple was indeed red, then the banana must have been yellow. We also know that \"The banana was yellow\" is true. \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can conclude that \"The apple was red\" is true. To do this, let's analyze the possibilities. If the banana was yellow, it could be because the apple was red (as stated in the first statement), but it could also be because of some other reason unrelated to the apple's color. \n\nWe can't be certain that the apple was red just because the banana was yellow, as there might be other factors at play. The first statement only guarantees that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow, but it doesn't guarantee the converse - that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\n\nAnswer: no",
