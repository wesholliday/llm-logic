            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. We know that \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is true, which means that if Mary was present, then Sue must have been present too. This is a conditional statement, and it does not provide any information about Mary's presence unless we know that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nWe are also given that \"Sue was at the wedding\" is true. Now, we can use this information to analyze the conditional statement. Since Sue was at the wedding, it is possible that Mary was also at the wedding, but it is not necessarily true. The conditional statement only guarantees that if Mary was present, then Sue would be present, but it does not guarantee the converse, i.e., if Sue was present, then Mary must have been present.\n\nIn other words, the presence of Sue does not necessarily imply the presence of Mary. There could be other reasons why Sue was at the wedding, and Mary might not have been there at all.\n\nAnswer: no",
