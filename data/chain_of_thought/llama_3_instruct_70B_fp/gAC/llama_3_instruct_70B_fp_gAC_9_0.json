            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a conditional statement, where we have \"If P, then Q\" (If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt). We are also given that Q is true (Mark bought the blue shirt). The question is whether we can conclude that P is true (Lisa bought the red shirt).\n\nIn general, from \"If P, then Q\" and Q, we cannot necessarily conclude that P is true. This is because the conditional statement only guarantees that if P is true, then Q must be true, but it does not provide any information about what happens when Q is true.\n\nFor example, consider the statement \"If it rains, then the street will be wet.\" If we know that the street is wet, we cannot conclude that it rained, because there could be other reasons why the street is wet (e.g., a water main break).\n\nIn this case, we have \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" and \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" While it is possible that Lisa bought the red shirt, we cannot conclude that she did solely based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
