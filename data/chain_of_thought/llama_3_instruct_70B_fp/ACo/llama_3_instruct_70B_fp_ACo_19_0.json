If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that Jen watched basketball. Now, let's analyze statement 2. It's a conditional statement, which means it has an \"if\" clause (Tom watched football) and a \"then\" clause (Jen watched basketball). The \"then\" clause is already true, as stated in statement 1.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that the \"if\" clause (Tom watched football) is true. There could be other reasons why Jen watched basketball, and Tom watching football might not be one of them.\n\nIn other words, the fact that the \"then\" clause is true does not guarantee that the \"if\" clause is also true. This is a classic example of a logical fallacy called \"affirming the consequent.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
