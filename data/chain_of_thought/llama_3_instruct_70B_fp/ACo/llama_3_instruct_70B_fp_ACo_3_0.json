However, it does not provide any information about who actually wrote the book.\n\nNow, let's try to infer \"The book was written by James\" from these statements. We know that the book is a mystery novel (from statement 1), but that doesn't necessarily mean James wrote it. There could be other authors who wrote mystery novels as well.\n\nThe second statement only provides a conditional relationship between James writing the book and the book being a mystery novel. It does not provide any conclusive evidence that James wrote the book.\n\nAnswer: no",
