It means that if the vampire is awake, it guarantees that the mummy is also awake.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nWe know the mummy is awake (from statement 1). The conditional statement (2) tells us that if the vampire is awake, the mummy would be awake as well. However, it does not provide any information about the vampire's state when the mummy is awake. There could be other reasons why the mummy is awake, unrelated to the vampire's state.\n\nAnswer: no",
