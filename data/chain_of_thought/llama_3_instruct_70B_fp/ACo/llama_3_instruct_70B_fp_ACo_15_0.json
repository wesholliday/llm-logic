If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. But we already know that Erin took a train (from statement 1). This does not necessarily mean that Sam took a plane. There could be other reasons why Erin took a train, and Sam taking a plane is just one possible scenario.\n\nWe cannot conclude that Sam took a plane solely based on the given information. The fact that Erin took a train does not provide enough evidence to infer that Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: no",
