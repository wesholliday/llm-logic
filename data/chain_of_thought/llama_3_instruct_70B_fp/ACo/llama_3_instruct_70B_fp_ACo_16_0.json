However, it does not provide any information about the shirt's material if the pants are denim.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know the pants are denim. But statement 2 only guarantees that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim. It does not provide any information about the shirt's material if the pants are denim. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the shirt is cotton just because the pants are denim.\n\nAnswer: no",
