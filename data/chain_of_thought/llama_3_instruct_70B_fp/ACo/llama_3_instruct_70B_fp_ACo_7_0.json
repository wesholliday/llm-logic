The conditional statement (2) says that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. Since Chris did finish the race, it's possible that Alex finished the race, but it's not necessarily true.\n\nThe problem is that the conditional statement only guarantees that if Alex finished, then Chris finished. It doesn't provide any information about Alex's status if Chris finished. There could be other reasons why Chris finished the race, unrelated to Alex's participation.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Alex finished the race solely based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
