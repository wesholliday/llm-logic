But the conditional statement (2) says that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. Since we already know the robot visited Jupiter, it doesn't necessarily mean the alien visited Mars. There could be other reasons why the robot visited Jupiter, not just because the alien visited Mars.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only guarantees that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter, but it doesn't provide any information about the alien visiting Mars in the first place.\n\nAnswer: no",
