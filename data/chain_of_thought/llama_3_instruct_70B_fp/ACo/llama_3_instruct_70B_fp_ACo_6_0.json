The conditional statement (2) says that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. But we already know that Bob chose pasta, so the condition \"Sue chose pizza\" is not necessarily true. There could be other reasons why Bob chose pasta.\n\nIn other words, the fact that Bob chose pasta does not provide enough information to conclude that Sue chose pizza. There might be other scenarios where Bob chose pasta, and Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: no",
