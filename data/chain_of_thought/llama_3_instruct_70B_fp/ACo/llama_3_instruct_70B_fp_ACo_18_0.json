However, this does not necessarily imply that P (the doll was plastic) is true. There could be other reasons why the truck is metal, unrelated to the doll's material.\n\nIn logic, this is known as affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy. We cannot conclude that P is true simply because Q is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
