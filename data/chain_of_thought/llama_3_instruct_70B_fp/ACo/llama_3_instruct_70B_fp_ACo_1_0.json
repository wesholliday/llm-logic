However, it does not provide any information about Mary's presence at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's try to infer \"Mary was at the wedding\" from these statements. We know that Sue was at the wedding, but that doesn't necessarily mean Mary was also there. The second statement only guarantees Sue's presence if Mary was present, but it doesn't provide any evidence for Mary's presence.\n\nAnswer: no",
