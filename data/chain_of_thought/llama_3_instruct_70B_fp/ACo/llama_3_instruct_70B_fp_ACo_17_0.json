But the conditional statement (2) only guarantees that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. It does not provide any information about Ben eating pasta.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only implies that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad, but it does not imply the converse: that if Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Ben ate pasta solely based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
