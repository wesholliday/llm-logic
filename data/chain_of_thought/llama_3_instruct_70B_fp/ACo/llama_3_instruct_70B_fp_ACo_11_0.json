However, this does not necessarily mean that P (the cake was chocolate) is true. There could be other reasons why the muffins were blueberry, unrelated to the cake being chocolate.\n\nIn logic, this is known as affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy. Just because Q is true, we cannot conclude that P is true. We need more information to establish a causal relationship between P and Q.\n\nAnswer: no",
