The conditional statement (2) says that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. However, it does not provide any information about Joe's whereabouts. It only establishes a connection between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo.\n\nSince we don't have any direct information about Joe going to the park, we cannot infer that Joe went to the park solely based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
