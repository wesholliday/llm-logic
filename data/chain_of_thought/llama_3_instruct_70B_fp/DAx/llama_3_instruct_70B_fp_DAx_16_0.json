            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the sneg was crampled\" and B is \"the sneg sproted the frink\".\n\n2. \"The sneg was not crampled\" - This statement negates the condition A, i.e., the sneg was not crampled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince the condition A (the sneg was crampled) is not true, we cannot conclude that B (the sneg sproted the frink) must be true. However, we can infer that if A is not true, then the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" does not provide any information about B. In other words, the truth value of B is unknown.\n\nBut, we can use a principle called modus tollens, which states that if A implies B, and A is not true, then B must be false. In this case, if \"the sneg was crampled\" implies \"the sneg sproted the frink\", and \"the sneg was not crampled\", then we can infer that \"the sneg did not sprot the frink\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
