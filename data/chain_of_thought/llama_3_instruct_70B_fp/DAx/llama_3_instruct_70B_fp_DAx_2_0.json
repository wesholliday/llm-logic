(Conditional statement)\n2. The wug was not flooped. (Factual statement)\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the wug was not flooped. Now, let's examine the conditional statement (1). It says that if the wug was flooped, then it would have bimmed the zoint. However, since we know that the wug was not flooped (from statement 2), the condition for the wug to bim the zoint is not met.\n\nIn other words, the conditional statement (1) only guarantees that if the wug was flooped, then it would have bimmed the zoint. But since the wug was not flooped, we cannot conclude that it bimmed the zoint. In fact, we can infer the opposite: since the condition for bimming the zoint was not met, the wug did not bim the zoint.\n\nAnswer: yes",
