            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"M \u2192 Q\", where M means \"the splat was morphed\" and Q means \"the splat quanked\".\n2. \"The splat was not morphed\" - This statement can be represented as \"\u00acM\", where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if M is true, then Q must be true. However, the second statement tells us that M is actually false (\u00acM). \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"The splat did not quank\" (\u00acQ) from these two statements. Since M is false, the conditional statement \"M \u2192 Q\" does not provide any information about Q. The truth value of Q is not determined by the given statements.\n\nHowever, we can use a indirect approach. If Q were true, then M would have to be true (because of the conditional statement), but we know that M is false. Therefore, Q must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
