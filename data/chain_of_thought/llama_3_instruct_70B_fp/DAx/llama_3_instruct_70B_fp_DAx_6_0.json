            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" - This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"the grommet was sploffed\" and B is \"the grommet plopped the frink\".\n\n2. \"The grommet was not sploffed\" - This statement negates the condition A, i.e., \"the grommet was sploffed\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince A is false (the grommet was not sploffed), we cannot conclude anything about B (the grommet plopped the frink) based on the conditional statement alone. However, we can use the law of contrapositive, which states that if A \u2192 B, then \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA.\n\nIn this case, if we assume that the grommet did plop the frink (B), then the contrapositive would imply that the grommet was sploffed (A), which contradicts the given statement \"The grommet was not sploffed\". Therefore, we can conclude that the grommet did not plop the frink.\n\nAnswer: yes",
