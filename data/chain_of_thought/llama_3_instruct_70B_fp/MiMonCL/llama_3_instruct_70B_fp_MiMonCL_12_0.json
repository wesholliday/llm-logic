            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The contract might be legally binding and have hidden clauses\" implies that there are two possible conditions that the contract might satisfy: being legally binding and having hidden clauses. The phrase \"might be\" indicates uncertainty or possibility, and the conjunction \"and\" connects the two conditions. \n\nTo infer \"The contract might be legally binding\", we need to determine if the original statement provides sufficient information to support this claim. Since the original statement explicitly mentions that the contract \"might be legally binding\", we can conclude that this condition is indeed possible.\n\nAnswer: yes",
