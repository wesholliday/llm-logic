This statement implies that there are two possible outcomes: the discovery is accidental, and it leads to a Nobel Prize. \n\nTo infer \"The discovery might be accidental\", we need to determine if the original statement guarantees the possibility of an accidental discovery, regardless of the Nobel Prize outcome. \n\nSince the original statement includes \"The discovery might be accidental\" as one of the conditions, it is clear that the possibility of an accidental discovery is already acknowledged. The additional information about the Nobel Prize does not affect the possibility of an accidental discovery.\n\nAnswer: yes",
