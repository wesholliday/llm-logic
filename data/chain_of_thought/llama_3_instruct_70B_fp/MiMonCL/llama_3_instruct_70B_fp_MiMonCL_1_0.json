            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The flibbit might be zorped and gribbled\" implies that there is a possibility that the flibbit will undergo both zorping and gribbling. Since zorping is one of the two actions mentioned, it is reasonable to conclude that the possibility of zorping exists independently of gribbling. In other words, even if gribbling does not occur, the flibbit might still be zorped. This is because the original statement does not imply that zorping is conditional on gribbling.\n\nAnswer: yes",
