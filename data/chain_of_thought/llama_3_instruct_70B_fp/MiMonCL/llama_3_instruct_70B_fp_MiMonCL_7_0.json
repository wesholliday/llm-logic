The word \"and\" is a conjunction that connects two clauses, indicating that both clauses are true. \n\nFrom this statement, we can isolate the first clause \"The investment might be risky\" and consider it separately. Since the original statement does not contradict or negate this clause, we can infer that the investment indeed might be risky.\n\nAnswer: yes",
