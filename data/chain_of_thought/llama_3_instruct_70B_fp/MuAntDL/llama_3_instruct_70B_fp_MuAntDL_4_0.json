However, this statement does not provide any information that allows us to eliminate one of these possibilities. It simply presents two options as the only possibilities.\n\nIn order to infer \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM\", we would need additional information that rules out the possibility of the meeting being cancelled. Since we don't have that information, we cannot make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
