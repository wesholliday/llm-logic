This is a disjunctive statement, meaning it presents two alternatives. The statement does not provide any information that would allow us to eliminate one of the alternatives, so we cannot infer that the medicine must have been taken with food. The statement only guarantees that it was taken with food or on an empty stomach, but it does not specify which one.\n\nAnswer: no",
