            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The package must have been delivered yesterday or the day before\" implies that there are only two possible days when the package could have been delivered: yesterday or the day before. However, it does not provide any information that suggests yesterday is the only possible day or the most likely day for the delivery. In fact, the statement treats both options (yesterday and the day before) as equally possible.\n\nFrom this statement, we cannot eliminate the possibility that the package was delivered the day before, so we cannot infer that the package must have been delivered yesterday. The original statement provides a range of possible days, and we cannot narrow it down to a single day without additional information.\n\nAnswer: no",
