The term \"or\" is used to connect the two possibilities, suggesting that both formal and semi-formal are acceptable options. \n\nIn order to infer that \"The event must have been formal\", we would need more information that specifically rules out the possibility of the event being semi-formal. However, the original statement does not provide such information, and therefore, we cannot make a definitive conclusion that the event was formal.\n\nAnswer: no",
