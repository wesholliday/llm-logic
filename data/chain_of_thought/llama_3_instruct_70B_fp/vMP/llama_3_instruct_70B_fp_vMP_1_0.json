            "content": "Explanation: To determine if an argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, we have a conditional statement as the first premise: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\". This can be represented as \"M \u2192 S\", where M represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S represents \"Sue was at the wedding\". The second premise is \"Mary was at the wedding\", which is simply M.\n\nNow, we need to see if we can deduce the conclusion \"Sue was at the wedding\" (S) from the premises. Since we have M \u2192 S and M, we can apply modus ponens, a valid inference rule, which states that if we have a conditional statement and the antecedent (M) is true, we can infer the consequent (S). Therefore, we can conclude that S is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
