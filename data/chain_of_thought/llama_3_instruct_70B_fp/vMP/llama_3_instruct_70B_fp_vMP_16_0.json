            "content": "Explanation: To determine if an argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, the argument has the form:\n\nIf P, then Q\nP\n\u2234 Q\n\nThis is a classic form of argument known as modus ponens. It says that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, then we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn this specific argument, the first premise is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\", which sets up a conditional relationship between the shirt being cotton and the pants being denim. The second premise is \"The shirt was cotton\", which asserts that the condition is true. Therefore, according to the modus ponens form, we can conclude that the pants were denim.\n\nAnswer: yes",
