            "content": "Explanation: To determine if an argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, we have a conditional statement as the first premise: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\". This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q is \"Kate ate salad\". The second premise is \"Ben ate pasta\", which is P. \n\nNow, we need to see if we can infer Q (Kate ate salad) from P and P \u2192 Q. This is a classic case of modus ponens, a valid inference rule in logic. According to modus ponens, if we have P \u2192 Q and P, we can conclude Q. Therefore, in this argument, the conclusion \"Kate ate salad\" follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
