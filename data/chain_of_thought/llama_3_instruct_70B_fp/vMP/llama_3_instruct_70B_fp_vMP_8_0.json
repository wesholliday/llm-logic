            "content": "Explanation: To determine if an argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, the argument has the form:\n\nIf P, then Q\nP\n\u2234 Q\n\nWhere P represents \"the vampire was awake\" and Q represents \"the mummy was awake\".\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus ponens, which is a valid argument form. The first premise sets up a conditional relationship between P and Q, stating that if P is true, then Q must also be true. The second premise asserts that P is indeed true. Therefore, it logically follows that Q must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
