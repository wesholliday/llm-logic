            "content": "Explanation: To determine if an argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, we have a conditional statement as the first premise: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\". This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\". The second premise is \"P\", which is the antecedent of the conditional statement.\n\nWhen we have a conditional statement and its antecedent as premises, we can apply modus ponens, a valid inference rule. Modus ponens states that if we have \"P \u2192 Q\" and \"P\", we can infer \"Q\". In this case, we have \"P \u2192 Q\" (first premise) and \"P\" (second premise), so we can infer \"Q\", which is the conclusion \"Mark bought the blue shirt\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
