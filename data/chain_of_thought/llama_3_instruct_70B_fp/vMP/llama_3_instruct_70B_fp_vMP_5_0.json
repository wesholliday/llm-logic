            "content": "Explanation: To determine if an argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, we have a conditional statement as the first premise: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\". This can be represented as \"J \u2192 A\", where \"J\" stands for \"Jeff played basketball\" and \"A\" stands for \"Amy played tennis\". The second premise is \"Jeff played basketball\", which can be represented as \"J\". \n\nNow, we need to see if the conclusion \"Amy played tennis\" (A) follows logically from the premises. Since we have a conditional statement \"J \u2192 A\" and we know that \"J\" is true (from the second premise), we can apply modus ponens, a valid inference rule. Modus ponens states that if we have \"J \u2192 A\" and \"J\", we can infer \"A\". \n\nIn this case, we have exactly that: \"J \u2192 A\" (first premise) and \"J\" (second premise), so we can conclude \"A\" (Amy played tennis). Therefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
