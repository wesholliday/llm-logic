Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door.\nThis statement implies that there are only two possible locations for the shoes: in the closet or lined up by the door.\n\n2. It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door.\nThis statement negates the possibility that the shoes are lined up by the door.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince the shoes cannot be lined up by the door (due to statement 2), and there are only two possible locations (due to statement 1), the only remaining possibility is that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
