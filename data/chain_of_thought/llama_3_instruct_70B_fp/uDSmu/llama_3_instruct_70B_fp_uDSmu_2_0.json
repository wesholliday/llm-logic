Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\nThis statement implies that there are only two possible locations for the book: the shelf or the table.\n\n2. It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\nThis statement negates the possibility that the book must be on the table. However, it doesn't rule out the possibility that the book could be on the table, but it's not necessarily the case.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince there are only two possible locations for the book (shelf or table), and it's not necessarily the case that the book is on the table, we can infer that the book is on the shelf. If the book were on the table, it would mean that it must be on the table, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
