Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\nThis statement implies that there are only two possible scenarios: Fido is inside, or Fido must be in the garden.\n\n2. It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\nThis statement negates the second possibility mentioned in statement 1, which means Fido must not be in the garden.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation: We know that either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden, but we've just established that Fido must not be in the garden. This leaves us with only one remaining possibility: Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
