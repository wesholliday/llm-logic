This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that one of them must be true and the other must be false.\n\nWe are also told that it's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor. This means that the option \"it must be blending in on the floor\" is false.\n\nSince the two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, if the option \"it must be blending in on the floor\" is false, then the other option \"the missing puzzle piece is in the box\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
