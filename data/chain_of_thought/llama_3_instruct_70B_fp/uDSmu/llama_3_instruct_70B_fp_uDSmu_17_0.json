This implies that these are the only two possible locations of the scarf. \n\nWe are also told that it's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack. This means that the scarf is not necessarily on the coat rack. Since we know that the scarf must be in one of the two locations, and it's not necessarily on the coat rack, it must be in the other location, which is the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
