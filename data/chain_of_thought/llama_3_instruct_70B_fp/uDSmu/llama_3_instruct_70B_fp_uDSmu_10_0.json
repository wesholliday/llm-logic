This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that one of them must be true and the other must be false.\n\nWe are also told that it's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed. This means that the option \"the missing sock must be under the bed\" is false.\n\nSince the two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, if the option \"the missing sock must be under the bed\" is false, then the other option \"the missing sock is in the laundry basket\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
