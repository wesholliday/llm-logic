This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that one of them must be true and the other must be false.\n\nWe are also told that it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge. This means that the option \"the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" is false.\n\nNow, since we know that one of the two options must be true, and the option \"the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" is false, we can conclude that the other option \"the milk is on the counter\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
