This implies that these are the only two possible locations for the toy. \n\nThen, we are told that it's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf. This means that the toy is not necessarily on the bookshelf. \n\nSince we know that the toy is either in the toy box or on the bookshelf, and it's not necessarily on the bookshelf, the only other possibility is that the toy is in the toy box. \n\nAnswer: yes",
