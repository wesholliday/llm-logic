This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that one of them must be true and the other must be false.\n\nWe are also told that it's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet. This means that the option \"the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" is false.\n\nNow, since we know that one of the two options must be true, and the second option is false, we can conclude that the first option \"the keys are in the drawer\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
