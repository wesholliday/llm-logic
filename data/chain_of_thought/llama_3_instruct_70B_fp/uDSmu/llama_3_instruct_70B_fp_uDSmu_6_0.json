This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive, meaning that if one is true, the other must be false. \n\nWe are also told that it's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen. This means that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen. \n\nNow, since the phone is not ringing in the kitchen, and we know that either it's in the living room or it's ringing in the kitchen, we can conclude that the phone must be in the living room. \n\nAnswer: yes",
