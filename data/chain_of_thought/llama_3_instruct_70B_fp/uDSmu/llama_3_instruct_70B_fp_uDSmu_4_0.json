This implies that these two options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that one of them must be true and the other must be false.\n\nWe are also told that it's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom. This means that the option \"playing in the bedroom\" is false.\n\nNow, since we know that either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom, and playing in the bedroom is not the case, we can conclude that the only remaining option is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
