The first statement is a disjunction, which means it presents two possibilities: either the cookies are hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar. This can be represented as \"P or J\", where P stands for \"cookies are hidden in the pantry\" and J stands for \"cookies are in the jar\".\n\nThe second statement negates the first possibility, stating that the cookies aren't hidden in the pantry. This can be represented as \"not P\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. We know that either P or J is true, and we also know that P is not true. This means that the only remaining possibility is J, which is \"the cookies are in the jar\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
