It says that either the cat is playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch. This implies that if the cat is not playing in the bedroom, then it must be napping on the couch, because these are the only two possibilities presented.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the cat is not playing in the bedroom. This means we can eliminate the first option from the disjunction, leaving us with only one possibility: the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
