Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box. \nThis statement implies that there are only two possible locations for the missing puzzle piece: on the floor or in the box. \n\n2. The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor. \nThis statement eliminates one of the possible locations mentioned in the first statement, which is on the floor. \n\nNow, we are left with only one possible location, which is in the box. Since the first statement says it must be in one of these two locations, and we have eliminated one of them, it logically follows that the missing puzzle piece must be in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
