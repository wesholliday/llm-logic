            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. The first statement is a disjunction, which means it presents two possibilities: either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer. This implies that these two possibilities are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that one of them must be true.\n\nThe second statement negates one of the possibilities, namely, the keys aren't dangling in the cabinet. This means that the first possibility is eliminated, leaving us with only one option: the keys are in the drawer.\n\nSince the original disjunction presented two mutually exclusive and exhaustive possibilities, and one of them has been eliminated, we are left with the only remaining possibility, which is that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
