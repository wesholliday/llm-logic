It's an exclusive or, meaning that the pen can't be in both places at the same time.\n\n2. \"The pen might not be on my desk\" - This statement indicates that there is a possibility that the pen is not on the desk.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the pen might not be on the desk, and there are only two possible locations (on the desk or in the bag), then it's possible that the pen is in the bag. However, we can't be certain that the pen is in the bag because the second statement only tells us that the pen might not be on the desk, not that it's definitely not on the desk.\n\nAnswer: no",
