The first statement is a disjunction, which means it presents two possibilities: the phone is ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room. This statement does not provide any information about which option is true, but it does tell us that one of these two options must be true.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen. This means we can eliminate the first option presented in the disjunction. Since the disjunction states that one of the two options must be true, and we know the first option is not true, we are left with the second option: the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes",
