            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The concert must have been sold out\" implies that all the available tickets for the concert have been sold, leaving none available. The inferred statement \"The concert must have been sold out or had limited tickets\" is a broader claim that includes the possibility of the concert being sold out, but also allows for the possibility that there were limited tickets available, even if they haven't all been sold.\n\nIn this case, we can infer the broader statement because being \"sold out\" is a specific scenario that falls under the category of \"sold out or had limited tickets\". If the concert was indeed sold out, then it necessarily had limited tickets (i.e., zero available). Therefore, the inferred statement is a logical consequence of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
