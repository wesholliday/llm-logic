            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can make this inference, let's break down the original statement and the proposed inference.\n\nThe original statement is \"The keys must be in the drawer.\" This statement asserts that the keys are necessarily in the drawer, implying that it's the only possible location for the keys.\n\nThe proposed inference is \"The keys must be in the drawer or on the table.\" This statement introduces an additional possibility, namely, that the keys could be on the table.\n\nIn logic, when we have a statement of the form \"A must be true,\" we can infer \"A or B must be true\" because the original statement already guarantees the truth of A. Adding B as an alternative possibility doesn't contradict the original statement, as A is still a possible (and necessary) location for the keys.\n\nAnswer: yes",
