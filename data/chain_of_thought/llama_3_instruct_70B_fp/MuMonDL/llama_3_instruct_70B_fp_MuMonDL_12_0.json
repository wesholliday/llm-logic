            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday\" implies that the project had to be finished by Friday, and it's not possible for it to be completed after Friday. \n\nWhen we consider the statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday or next week\", we are essentially adding an alternative option \"next week\" to the original deadline \"Friday\". This alternative option is actually a later deadline than the original one, which means it's less restrictive. \n\nSince the original statement only allows for completion by Friday, adding a later option like \"next week\" doesn't contradict the original statement. In fact, it's a more permissive statement that still satisfies the original requirement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
