            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The room must have been cleaned daily\" implies a strict requirement that the room was cleaned every day. The proposed inference \"The room must have been cleaned daily or as requested\" seems to relax this requirement by adding an alternative condition \"as requested\". \n\nIn logic, when we add an alternative condition to a statement, we are essentially making the statement more permissive or inclusive. In this case, the original statement only allows for daily cleaning, whereas the inferred statement allows for either daily cleaning or cleaning as requested. \n\nSince the inferred statement is more permissive and includes the original condition, it is a logical consequence of the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes",
