            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can make this inference, let's break down the given statement and the statement we're trying to infer.\n\nThe original statement is \"The document must have been signed.\" This implies that signing the document is a necessary condition.\n\nThe statement we're trying to infer is \"The document must have been signed or approved.\" This statement introduces an additional possibility, \"approved,\" which is not present in the original statement.\n\nIn general, when we add an alternative possibility to a necessary condition, the resulting statement becomes weaker. In this case, \"signed or approved\" is a broader condition than just \"signed.\" Since the original statement only guarantees that the document must have been signed, we can't rule out the possibility that it might have been approved instead.\n\nHowever, the key word here is \"or.\" The \"or\" operator is inclusive, meaning that if the document was signed, it satisfies the condition \"signed or approved.\" Therefore, we can infer that if the document must have been signed, it must have been signed or approved, because signing is a subset of the broader condition.\n\nAnswer: yes",
