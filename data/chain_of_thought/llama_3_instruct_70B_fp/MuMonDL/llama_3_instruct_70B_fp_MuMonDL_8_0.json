            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays\" implies that the restaurant was not open on Mondays. The inferred statement \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays or had limited hours\" includes the original statement as one of the possible options. In other words, if the restaurant was closed on Mondays, then it is also true that it was either closed or had limited hours. The added option \"had limited hours\" does not contradict the original statement, but rather provides an additional possibility. \n\nAnswer: yes",
