The added phrase \"or been rescheduled\" introduces an alternative possibility, which is not present in the original statement. \n\nTo infer the new statement, we need to consider whether the original statement implies or allows for the possibility of the meeting being rescheduled. However, the original statement does not provide any information about rescheduling, it only asserts that the meeting was scheduled for 2 PM.\n\nAnswer: no",
