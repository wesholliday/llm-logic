            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The application must have been completed online\" implies that the application was completed through an online platform or medium. The phrase \"completed online\" suggests that the application was filled out and submitted through the internet. \n\nWhen we consider the statement \"The application must have been completed online or submitted electronically\", we can break it down into two parts: \"completed online\" and \"submitted electronically\". The first part \"completed online\" is identical to the original statement, and the second part \"submitted electronically\" is a broader category that includes online submissions as a subset. \n\nIn other words, submitting electronically encompasses not only online submissions but also other forms of electronic submissions, such as email attachments or digital files sent through other means. Since the original statement is a subset of the broader category, we can infer that if the application must have been completed online, it must also have been submitted electronically.\n\nAnswer: yes",
