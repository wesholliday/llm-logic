            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The movie must have been in English\" implies that the movie was entirely in English, with no other language or subtitles mentioned. However, if we consider the possibility of adding English subtitles to a movie, it would still satisfy the condition of having English in the movie. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that if the movie must have been in English, it is also possible that it had English subtitles.\n\nAnswer: yes",
