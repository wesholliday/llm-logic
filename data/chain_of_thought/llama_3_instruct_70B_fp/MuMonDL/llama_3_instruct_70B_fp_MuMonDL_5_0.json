            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package must have been delivered today\" implies that the package was definitely delivered today and not on any other day. The inferred statement \"The package must have been delivered today or tomorrow\" is a broader claim that includes the possibility of the package being delivered today, but also allows for the possibility of it being delivered tomorrow. \n\nSince the original statement is a subset of the inferred statement (today is a part of today or tomorrow), the inferred statement is logically consistent with the original statement. In other words, if the package must have been delivered today, then it is also true that it must have been delivered today or tomorrow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
