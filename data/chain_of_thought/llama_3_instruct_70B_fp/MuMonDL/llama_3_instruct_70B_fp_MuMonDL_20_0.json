            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The event must have been formal\" implies that the event had a certain level of formality. The question is whether we can infer that the event was either formal or black-tie. \n\nSince \"black-tie\" is a more specific and formal type of event, it is a subset of \"formal\" events. In other words, all black-tie events are formal, but not all formal events are black-tie. \n\nGiven that the original statement only mentions \"formal\", we can't be certain that it was specifically \"black-tie\". However, we can be certain that it was at least \"formal\", which means it could be either formal or black-tie (since black-tie is a type of formal event).\n\nAnswer: yes",
