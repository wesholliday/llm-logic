This sentence contains three clauses: \"The froodle must be quork blurble\", \"and\", and \"wobble for\". The \"and\" is a conjunction that connects the first two clauses. \n\nWhen we remove the \"and wobble for\" part, we are left with \"The froodle must be quork blurble\", which is a grammatically correct sentence. The removal of the second clause does not affect the meaning or grammatical correctness of the first clause.\n\nAnswer: yes",
