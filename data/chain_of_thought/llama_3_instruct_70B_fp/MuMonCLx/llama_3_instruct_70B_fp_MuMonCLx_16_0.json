This statement is a conjunction of two clauses: \"The snizzle must be quimble zump\" and \"frazzle plimp blimple\". \n\nIn logic, when we have a conjunction of two clauses, we can infer that each individual clause is true. This is because the conjunction is only true if both clauses are true. \n\nTherefore, from the given statement, we can infer that \"The snizzle must be quimble zump\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
