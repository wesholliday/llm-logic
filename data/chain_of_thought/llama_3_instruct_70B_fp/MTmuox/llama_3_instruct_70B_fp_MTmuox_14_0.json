But statement 1 denies this possibility, saying it's not the case that the clug must have been snugged. This creates a contradiction if we assume the clug was fleeked.\n\nTo avoid this contradiction, we must conclude that the clug was not fleeked. This way, we don't have to worry about the clug being snugged, and statement 1 remains true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
