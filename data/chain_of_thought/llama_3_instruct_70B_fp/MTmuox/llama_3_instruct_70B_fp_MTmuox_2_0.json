If the wug was flooped, then it necessarily bimmed the zoint.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the wug was flooped, then according to statement 2, it must have bimmed the zoint. But statement 1 denies this necessity. Therefore, the only way to reconcile these two statements is to conclude that the wug was not flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
