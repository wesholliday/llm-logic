If the antecedent (the grommet was sploffed) is true, then the consequent (the grommet must have plopped the frink) must also be true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the grommet was sploffed, then according to statement 2, the grommet must have plopped the frink. But statement 1 denies this possibility. Therefore, the only way to reconcile these two statements is to conclude that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
