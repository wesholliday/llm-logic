            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled\" can be rewritten as \"The sprocket does not have to be daggled\" or \"The sprocket might not have been daggled\".\n2. \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled\" is a conditional statement. It implies that if the sprocket was cranked, then it necessarily follows that it was daggled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the sprocket was cranked, then according to statement 2, it must have been daggled. But statement 1 tells us that the sprocket might not have been daggled. This means that the sprocket cannot have been cranked, because if it were, it would have to be daggled, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
