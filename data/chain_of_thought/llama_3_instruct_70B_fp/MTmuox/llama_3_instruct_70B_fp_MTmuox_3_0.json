            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the splat must have quanked\" - This statement denies the necessity of the splat having quanked. In other words, it's possible that the splat didn't quank.\n\n2. \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked\" - This is a conditional statement. If the splat was morphed, then it necessarily quanked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked (by statement 2). But we know that it's not the case that the splat must have quanked (by statement 1). This means that the assumption \"the splat was morphed\" leads to a contradiction. Therefore, we can conclude that the assumption is false, i.e., the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
