If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\nThis implies that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are definitely blueberry. It does not provide any information about the cake being chocolate or not.\n\n2. The muffins might not have been blueberry.\nThis statement introduces a possibility that the muffins were not blueberry. However, it does not provide any direct information about the cake.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the cake was indeed chocolate, then according to statement 1, the muffins must have been blueberry. But statement 2 says the muffins might not have been blueberry, which contradicts the conclusion drawn from statement 1. This contradiction arises because we assumed the cake was chocolate.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the assumption \"the cake was chocolate\" led to a contradiction, which means the cake was likely not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
