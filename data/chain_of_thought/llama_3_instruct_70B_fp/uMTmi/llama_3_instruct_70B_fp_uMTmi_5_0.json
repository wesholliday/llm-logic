If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\nThis implies that if Jeff played basketball, Amy definitely played tennis. It does not provide any information about what happens if Jeff did not play basketball.\n\n2. Amy might not have played tennis.\nThis statement tells us that there is a possibility that Amy did not play tennis.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis (from statement 1). But we know that Amy might not have played tennis (from statement 2). This means that Jeff cannot have played basketball, because if he did, Amy would have played tennis, which contradicts the possibility that Amy might not have played tennis.\n\nAnswer: yes",
