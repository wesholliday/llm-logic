(Uncertainty about the pants)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are definitely denim. However, statement 2 introduces uncertainty about the pants, saying they might not be denim.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim (by statement 1). But statement 2 says the pants might not be denim, which contradicts the implication. This means the shirt cannot be cotton, as it would lead to a contradiction.\n* If the shirt is not cotton, then we don't have any information about the pants, and statement 2's uncertainty is still valid.\n\nIn conclusion, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton because if it were, it would lead to a contradiction with the uncertainty about the pants.\n\nAnswer: yes",
