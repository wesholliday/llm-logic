The mummy might not have been awake. (Possibility: Mummy not awake)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the vampire was awake, the mummy would also be awake. However, statement 2 tells us that it's possible the mummy was not awake. This means that the vampire being awake would contradict the possibility of the mummy not being awake.\n\nSince we can't conclude that the mummy was definitely awake, we can't be certain that the vampire was awake either. In fact, if the mummy was not awake, it would imply that the vampire was not awake, because if the vampire were awake, the mummy would have to be awake as well.\n\nAnswer: yes",
