            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, it necessarily means Mark bought the blue shirt.\n2. Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. This statement introduces uncertainty about Mark's purchase.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Lisa bought the red shirt, then according to statement 1, Mark must have bought the blue shirt. However, statement 2 contradicts this by saying Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. This contradiction arises because if Lisa bought the red shirt, Mark should have bought the blue shirt, but Mark might not have bought it.\n\nThe only way to resolve this contradiction is to assume that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. If Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, then the implication in statement 1 doesn't apply, and we can't conclude that Mark bought the blue shirt. This aligns with the uncertainty introduced in statement 2.\n\nAnswer: yes",
