If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\nThis implies that if the apple is red, then the banana is definitely yellow.\n\n2. The banana might not have been yellow.\nThis statement suggests that there is a possibility that the banana was not yellow.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the apple was red, then according to statement 1, the banana must have been yellow. But statement 2 says the banana might not have been yellow, which contradicts the conclusion drawn from statement 1. This contradiction arises because the apple is assumed to be red.\n\nTo avoid this contradiction, we can infer that the apple was not red. If the apple was not red, then statement 1 does not imply that the banana must have been yellow, and statement 2's possibility of the banana not being yellow does not create a contradiction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
