This implies that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob's choice is definitely pasta.\n2. Bob might not have chosen pasta. This statement does not provide any direct information about Sue's choice, but it does tell us that Bob's choice is not necessarily pasta.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. However, statement 2 tells us that Bob might not have chosen pasta. This means that Sue might not have chosen pizza, because if she did, then Bob would have chosen pasta, which is not necessarily the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
