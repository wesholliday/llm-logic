Kate might not have eaten salad. This implies that it's possible Kate didn't eat salad.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad (by statement 1). But Kate might not have eaten salad (by statement 2). This means that if Ben ate pasta, it would lead to a contradiction, since Kate can't both have eaten salad (by statement 1) and might not have eaten salad (by statement 2).\n\nTo avoid this contradiction, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta. If Ben didn't eat pasta, then the implication in statement 1 doesn't apply, and we don't have a contradiction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
