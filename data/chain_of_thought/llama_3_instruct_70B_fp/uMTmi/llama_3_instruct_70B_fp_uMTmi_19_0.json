If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\nThis implies that if Tom watched football, then it's a guarantee that Jen watched basketball.\n\n2. Jen might not have watched basketball.\nThis statement tells us that it's possible that Jen didn't watch basketball.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Tom watched football, then according to statement 1, Jen must have watched basketball. But statement 2 says that Jen might not have watched basketball, which contradicts the conclusion we drew from statement 1. This contradiction can only be resolved if Tom did not watch football, because if Tom didn't watch football, then we can't conclude that Jen watched basketball, and it's possible that Jen didn't watch basketball (as stated in statement 2).\n\nAnswer: yes",
