If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\nThis implies that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot's visit to Jupiter is a certainty.\n\n2. The robot might not have visited Jupiter.\nThis statement introduces a possibility that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the alien visited Mars, then according to statement 1, the robot must have visited Jupiter. However, statement 2 suggests that the robot might not have visited Jupiter. This creates a contradiction, as the robot cannot both have visited and not visited Jupiter.\n\nTo resolve this contradiction, we need to re-examine our assumption that the alien visited Mars. If the alien did visit Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter, but this is not possible according to statement 2. Therefore, our initial assumption that the alien visited Mars must be incorrect.\n\nAnswer: yes",
