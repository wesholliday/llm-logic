            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This implies that Mary's presence at the wedding is a sufficient condition for Sue's presence.\n2. Sue might not have been at the wedding. This statement does not provide any direct information about Mary's presence, but it does tell us that Sue's presence is not certain.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding (by statement 1). However, we know that Sue might not have been at the wedding (by statement 2). This creates a contradiction, as Mary's presence would imply Sue's presence, but Sue's presence is not certain.\n\nThe only way to resolve this contradiction is to assume that Mary was not at the wedding. If Mary was not at the wedding, then the implication \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" does not apply, and we are left with the uncertainty about Sue's presence, which is consistent with statement 2.\n\nAnswer: yes",
