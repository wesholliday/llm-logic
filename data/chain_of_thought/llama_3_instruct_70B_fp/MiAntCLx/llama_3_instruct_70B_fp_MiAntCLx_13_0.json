The added phrase \"and wobble zooble\" introduces a new concept, \"wobble zooble\", which is not mentioned in the original statement. \n\nThe original statement does not provide any information about \"wobble zooble\" or its relationship with \"shimble\" or the \"grooble\". Therefore, we cannot infer the existence or involvement of \"wobble zooble\" based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
