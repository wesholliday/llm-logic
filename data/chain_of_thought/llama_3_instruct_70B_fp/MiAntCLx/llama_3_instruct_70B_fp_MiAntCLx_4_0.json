However, it does not provide any information about the floob's presence in the quibble glorp. \n\nThe added clause \"and in the quibble glorp\" introduces new information that is not present in the original statement. Since the original statement does not provide any information about the quibble glorp, we cannot infer the presence of the floob in the quibble glorp based on the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
