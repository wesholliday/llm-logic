The added phrase \"and zibble at zibber zibber\" introduces new information that is not present in the original statement. \n\nTo infer the longer statement, we would need to have some additional information or evidence that suggests the plimp's being blurble quank is related to zibbling at zibber zibber. However, since we don't have any such information, we cannot logically conclude the longer statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: no",
