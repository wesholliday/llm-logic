However, it does not provide any information about the snork being grooble or not. \n\nThe addition of \"and grooble\" to the original statement changes its meaning, as it now implies that the snork might be both bimboozle and grooble. Since the original statement does not provide any information about grooble, we cannot infer the new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: no",
