The shorter statement is 'The wumble might be plonk flump', and the longer statement is 'The wumble might be plonk flump and snork zibber quank'. \n\nTo determine if we can make this inference, we need to examine the relationship between the two statements. The longer statement includes all the information from the shorter statement, plus some additional information ('snork zibber quank'). \n\nIn general, we cannot infer a longer statement from a shorter one simply because the longer statement contains more information. The shorter statement does not provide any evidence or justification for the additional information in the longer statement. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the longer statement from the shorter one.\n\nAnswer: no",
