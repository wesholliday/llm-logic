In this case, the original statement only provides information about the possibility of the zazzle being blurble, but it does not provide any information about quorpling a zizz.\n\nSince the original statement does not provide any evidence or implication about quorpling a zizz, we cannot logically infer the additional claim made in the proposed inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
