In this case, the original statement only provides information about the possibility of the blimp being zooble, but it does not provide any information about the blimp being blurble by froodle.\n\nSince the additional claim about being blurble by froodle is not supported by the original statement, we cannot infer the proposed statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
