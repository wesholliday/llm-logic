In other words, plooked implies nugged.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the shank was plooked, then according to statement 2, it would be nugged. But statement 1 tells us that the shank is not nugged. Therefore, it cannot be plooked, because if it were, it would be nugged, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
