'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled' - This statement implies that if the sprocket was cranked, it would necessarily be daggled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the sprocket was cranked, it would be daggled (according to statement 2). But we know that the sprocket is not daggled (according to statement 1). Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that the sprocket was not cranked, because if it were cranked, it would be daggled, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
