            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. 'The fribble did not crink' - This statement tells us that the fribble did not exhibit the behavior of crinking.\n2. 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked' - This statement sets up a conditional relationship between the fribble being snurgled and the fribble crinking. It implies that if the fribble was snurgled, then it would have crinked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince the fribble did not crink (from statement 1), and the conditional statement (2) implies that if the fribble was snurgled, it would have crinked, we can conclude that the fribble was not snurgled. If it were snurgled, it would have crinked, but it didn't crink, so it must not have been snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
