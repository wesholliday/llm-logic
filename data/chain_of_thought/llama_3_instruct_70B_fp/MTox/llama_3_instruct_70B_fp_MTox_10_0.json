            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. 'The wug was not garpled' - This statement tells us that the wug is not in a garpled state.\n\n2. 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled' - This statement sets up a conditional relationship between being sproinged and being garpled. It implies that if the wug is sproinged, then it must be garpled.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the wug was sproinged. If it was sproinged, then according to the second statement, it would be garpled. However, this contradicts the first statement, which says the wug is not garpled.\n\nSince the assumption that the wug was sproinged leads to a contradiction, we can conclude that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
