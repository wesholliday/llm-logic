'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened' - This statement implies a conditional relationship between vroombed and spened. If the dreb is vroombed, it would necessarily be spened.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the dreb was vroombed, it would be spened (by statement 2). But we know the dreb is not spened (by statement 1). Therefore, the assumption that the dreb is vroombed leads to a contradiction. This means that the dreb cannot be vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
