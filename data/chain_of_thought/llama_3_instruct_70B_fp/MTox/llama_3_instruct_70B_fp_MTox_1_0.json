'If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled' - This statement sets up a conditional relationship between the flugel being blimmed and the flugel being zargled. It implies that if the flugel is blimmed, it must also be zargled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince the flugel is not zargled (from statement 1), and being blimmed would imply being zargled (from statement 2), we can conclude that the flugel cannot be blimmed. If it were blimmed, it would be zargled, but we know it's not zargled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
