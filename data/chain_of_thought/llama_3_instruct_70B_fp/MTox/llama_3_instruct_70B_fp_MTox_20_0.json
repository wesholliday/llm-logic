'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned' - This statement implies that if the fleeg was bluttered, it would have surned. Since we know the fleeg did not surn (from statement 1), we can infer that the fleeg was not bluttered. If it were bluttered, it would have surned, but it didn't, so it must not have been bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
