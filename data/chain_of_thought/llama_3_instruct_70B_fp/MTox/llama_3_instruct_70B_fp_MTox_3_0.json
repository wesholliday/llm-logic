'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked' - This statement implies that if the splat was morphed, it would have quanked.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince the splat did not quank (from statement 1), and morphing the splat would have made it quank (from statement 2), it's reasonable to conclude that the splat was not morphed. If it were morphed, it would have quanked, but it didn't, so it must not have been morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
