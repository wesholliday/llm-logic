It implies that if the wug was flooped, then it must have bimmed the zoint.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n* We know the wug did not bim the zoint (from statement 1).\n* If the wug was flooped, it would have bimmed the zoint (from statement 2).\n* Since the wug did not bim the zoint, it's possible that the wug was not flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
