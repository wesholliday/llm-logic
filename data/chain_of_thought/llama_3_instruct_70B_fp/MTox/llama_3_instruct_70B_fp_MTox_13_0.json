'If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged' - This statement sets up a conditional relationship between being slogged and being tragged. It implies that if the glip is slogged, it must also be tragged.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince the glip is not tragged (from statement 1), and being slogged implies being tragged (from statement 2), we can conclude that the glip cannot be slogged. If it were slogged, it would be tragged, but we know it's not tragged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
