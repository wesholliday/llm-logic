It implies that if the zinger is fraggled, then it must be smoogled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince the zinger is not smoogled (from statement 1), and being fraggled would imply being smoogled (from statement 2), we can conclude that the zinger cannot be fraggled. If it were fraggled, it would be smoogled, but we know it's not smoogled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
