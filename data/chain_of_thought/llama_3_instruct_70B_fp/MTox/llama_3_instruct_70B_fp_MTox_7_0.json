'If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked' - This statement implies that if the whiffle was shanked, it would have tinked. In other words, shanking the whiffle is a sufficient condition for it to tink.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince the whiffle did not tink (from statement 1), and shanking the whiffle would have made it tink (from statement 2), we can conclude that the whiffle was not shanked. If it were shanked, it would have tinked, but it didn't, so it must not have been shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
