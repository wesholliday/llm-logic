'The smip did not lup the zoint' - This statement tells us that the smip did not perform the action of lupping the zoint.\n2. 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint' - This statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the smip was shripped, then it would have lupped the zoint. However, it does not tell us whether the smip was actually shripped or not.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the smip was shripped, then according to statement 2, it would have lupped the zoint. But statement 1 tells us that the smip did not lup the zoint. Therefore, we can conclude that the smip was not shripped, because if it was, it would have lupped the zoint, which it did not.\n\nAnswer: yes",
