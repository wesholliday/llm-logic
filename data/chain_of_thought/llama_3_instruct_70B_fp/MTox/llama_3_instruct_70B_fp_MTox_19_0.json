It implies that if the smonk was vreebled, then it would have plagged.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince the smonk did not plagged (from statement 1), and the conditional statement (2) implies that if the smonk was vreebled, it would have plagged, we can conclude that the smonk was not vreebled. If it were vreebled, it would have plagged, but it didn't plagged, so it must not have been vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
