However, since we know from statement 1 that the sneg did not sproted the frink, we can infer that the condition \"the sneg was crampled\" must not be true.\n\nIn other words, if the sneg was crampled, it would have led to the sneg sproted the frink, but since that didn't happen, the sneg must not have been crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
