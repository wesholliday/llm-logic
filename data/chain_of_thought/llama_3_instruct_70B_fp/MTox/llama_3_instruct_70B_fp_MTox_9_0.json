'If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished' - This statement implies that if the twonk was plinked, it would have been varnished. Since we know the twonk is not varnished (from statement 1), we can conclude that the condition 'the twonk was plinked' must not be true, because if it were, the twonk would have been varnished, which is not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
