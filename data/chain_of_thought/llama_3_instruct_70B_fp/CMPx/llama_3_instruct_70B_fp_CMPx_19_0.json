    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a garplex, a beelhet, and a peedonk are competing to be domer of the year. Experts think the garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, with the peedonk having a much lower chance. Since these are the only domer candidates, if the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer. Moreover, it is likely the garplex will become domer and hence the beelhet likely won\u2019t become domer. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given information step by step. \n\nFirst, we know that the garplex is the most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, and the peedonk has a much lower chance. This implies that the probability of the garplex winning is high, the probability of the beelhet winning is relatively high but lower than the garplex, and the probability of the peedonk winning is low.\n\nNext, we are told that if the beelhet doesn't become domer, then if the garplex doesn't become domer, the peedonk will become domer. This implies that if both the garplex and the beelhet don't win, the peedonk will win.\n\nFinally, we are told that it is likely the garplex will become domer, and hence the beelhet likely won't become domer. This means that the probability of the garplex winning is high, which in turn means the probability of the beelhet winning is low.\n\nNow, the question asks whether it follows that it's likely that, if the garplex doesn't become domer, the peedonk will. \n\nIf the garplex doesn't become domer, it doesn't necessarily mean that the beelhet will win. The beelhet might still not win, and in that case, the peedonk will win. However, we know that the probability of the beelhet winning is relatively high compared to the peedonk. Therefore, it's more likely that the beelhet will win if the garplex doesn't, rather than the peedonk.\n\nAnswer: no",
