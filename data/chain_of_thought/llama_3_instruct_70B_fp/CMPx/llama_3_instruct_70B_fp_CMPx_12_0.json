    "user_prompt": "Suppose a stribben, a vanoon, and a jentapp are applying to rent a bondle. The owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant, followed by the vanoon, while the jentapp seems much less qualified to rent a bondle. Since these are the only applicants, if the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, then if the stribben isn\u2019t selected, the jentapp will be selected. Moreover, the stribben likely will be chosen and hence the vanoon likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the stribben isn\u2019t selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be?",

The owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant, followed by the vanoon, and the jentapp seems much less qualified. This implies that the owner's preference order is stribben > vanoon > jentapp.\n\n2. If the vanoon isn't selected, then if the stribben isn't selected, the jentapp will be selected. This means that if the vanoon is not chosen, the stribben must be chosen; otherwise, the jentapp will be chosen.\n\n3. The stribben likely will be chosen, and hence the vanoon likely won't be. This is consistent with the owner's preference order.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Is it likely that, if the stribben isn't selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be? \n\nIf the stribben isn't selected, it means the vanoon must be selected (from point 2). But this contradicts the fact that the vanoon likely won't be chosen (from point 3). Therefore, the assumption that the stribben isn't selected leads to a contradiction.\n\nAnswer: no",
