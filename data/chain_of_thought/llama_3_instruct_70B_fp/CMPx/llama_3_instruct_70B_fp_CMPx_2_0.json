    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

If the cramen doesn't get the zulision, the sulect will (since there are only three applicants).\n3. The jantiz is likely to get the zulision, which means the cramen is likely not to get it.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: \"Is it likely that, if the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, the sulect will?\"\n\nIf the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, it means the cramen or the sulect will get it. But we know the cramen is more qualified than the sulect, so it's more likely that the cramen will get the zulision if the jantiz doesn't. This means it's not necessarily likely that the sulect will get the zulision if the jantiz doesn't.\n\nAnswer: no",
