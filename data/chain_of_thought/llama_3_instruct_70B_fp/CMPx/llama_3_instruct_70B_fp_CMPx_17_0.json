    "user_prompt": "Suppose a flinker, a dringen, and a n\u00fcffen have the best projections to have a breakout season next year. Talent scouts believe it's highly probable the flinker will have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen, while the n\u00fcffen is an outside shot. Since these are the only top prospects, if the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. Moreover, scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season and hence the dringen likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information we have:\n\n1. The flinker is highly probable to have a breakout season.\n2. The dringen is closely behind the flinker in terms of probability.\n3. The n\u00fcffen is an outside shot.\n4. If the dringen doesn't have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season.\n5. The flinker will likely have a breakout season, so the dringen likely won't.\n\nFrom point 5, we know that the flinker's breakout season is likely, which means the dringen's breakout season is unlikely. Now, let's consider the conditional statement in point 4. If the dringen doesn't have a breakout season (which is likely), then if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. Since the flinker's breakout season is likely, the condition \"if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season\" is unlikely to occur. However, if it does occur, then the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season.\n\nAnswer: no",
