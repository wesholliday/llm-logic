    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crinel, a nafiz, and a tomul are competing to be snarggle of next year's laggle team. The crinel is considered the frontrunner for snarggle, followed by the nafiz, while the tomul is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates, if the nafiz isn\u2019t named snarggle, then if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle. Moreover, the crinel likely will be named snarggle and hence the nafiz likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given information step by step. \n\n1. The crinel is the frontrunner for snarggle, which means it is likely to be named snarggle.\n2. The nafiz is the second most likely candidate, but since the crinel is likely to be named snarggle, the nafiz likely won't be.\n3. If the nafiz isn't named snarggle, then if the crinel isn't named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle. This implies that if the crinel and nafiz are both not named snarggle, the tomul will be.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: Does it follow that it is likely that, if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be?\n\nWe know that the crinel is likely to be named snarggle, so the scenario where the crinel isn't named snarggle is unlikely. However, if we assume that the crinel isn't named snarggle, then we know that the nafiz isn't named snarggle either (since the crinel is the frontrunner). In this case, the tomul will be named snarggle.\n\nSo, while it is unlikely that the crinel isn't named snarggle, if that scenario does occur, it is likely that the tomul will be named snarggle.\n\nAnswer: yes",
