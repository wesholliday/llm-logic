This statement implies that there are two possibilities: the quank might be flonk, or the quank might be on flim. Since \"or\" is an inclusive operator, it means that either one or both of the possibilities can be true. Therefore, we can infer that the quank might be flonk, because it is one of the possibilities mentioned in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
