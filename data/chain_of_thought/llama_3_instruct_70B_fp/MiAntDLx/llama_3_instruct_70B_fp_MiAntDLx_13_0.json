            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The wozzle might be in zooble or gribble\" implies that there are two possible locations where the wozzle could be: zooble or gribble. The use of \"or\" suggests that the wozzle might be in one or the other, or possibly both. \n\nFrom this, we can infer that it is possible for the wozzle to be in zooble, because zooble is one of the two options mentioned. The fact that gribble is also mentioned as a possibility does not rule out the possibility that the wozzle is in zooble.\n\nAnswer: yes",
