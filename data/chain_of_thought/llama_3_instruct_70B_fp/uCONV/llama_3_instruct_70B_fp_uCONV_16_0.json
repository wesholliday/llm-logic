This statement implies that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the pants are denim. It only guarantees that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim, but it does not guarantee the reverse.\n\nTo infer that if the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton, we would need a statement that says \"If B, then A\", which is not provided. The original statement only provides a one-way implication, not a two-way implication.\n\nAnswer: no",
