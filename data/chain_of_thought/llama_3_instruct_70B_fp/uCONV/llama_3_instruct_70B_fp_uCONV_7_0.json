This implies that whenever A is true, B is also true. However, it does not necessarily imply that whenever B is true, A is also true. In other words, just because Chris finishing the race guarantees that Alex finished the race, it does not mean that Alex finishing the race is the only way for Chris to finish the race. There could be other scenarios where Chris finishes the race without Alex finishing the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
