This implication does not provide any information about the converse, i.e., \"If Q, then P\". In other words, just because we know that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal, it does not necessarily mean that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic. There could be other scenarios where the truck is metal, but the doll is not plastic.\n\nAnswer: no",
