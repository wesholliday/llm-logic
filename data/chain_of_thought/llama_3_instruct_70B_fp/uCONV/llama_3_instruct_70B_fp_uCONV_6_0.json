This means that if Sue chose pizza, then we can conclude that Bob chose pasta. However, this implication does not necessarily work in the reverse direction. \n\nIn other words, just because Bob chose pasta, we cannot automatically conclude that Sue chose pizza. There might be other possibilities, such as Sue choosing something else and Bob still choosing pasta. \n\nTo make a valid inference, we would need additional information or a bi-conditional statement, such as \"Sue chose pizza if and only if Bob chose pasta\". But with the given information, we cannot make a definitive conclusion about Sue's choice based on Bob's choice of pasta.\n\nAnswer: no",
