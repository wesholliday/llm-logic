This implication does not provide any information about the converse, i.e., whether \"M \u2192 V\" is true. \n\nIn other words, just because we know that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake, it does not necessarily mean that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake. There could be scenarios where the mummy is awake, but the vampire is not.\n\nAnswer: no",
