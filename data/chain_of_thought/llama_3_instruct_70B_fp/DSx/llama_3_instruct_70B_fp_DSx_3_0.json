It's an \"or\" statement, which means that if one condition is false, the other must be true.\n\n2. \"The splat is not quanked\" - This statement tells us that the splat is definitely not quanked.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. Since the splat is not quanked (from statement 2), and we know that either it's morphed or quanked (from statement 1), we can conclude that the only remaining possibility is that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
