It's an \"or\" statement, which means that if one condition is false, the other must be true.\n\n2. \"The flugel is not zargled\" - This statement tells us that the flugel is definitely not zargled.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. Since the flugel is not zargled (from statement 2), and we know that either it's blimmed or zargled (from statement 1), we can conclude that the flugel must be blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
