It's an exclusive or, meaning that both states cannot be true at the same time.\n\n2. \"The sprocket is not daggled\" - This statement tells us that the sprocket is definitely not in the daggled state.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. Since the sprocket is not daggled, and it can only be either cranked or daggled, we can conclude that the sprocket must be cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
