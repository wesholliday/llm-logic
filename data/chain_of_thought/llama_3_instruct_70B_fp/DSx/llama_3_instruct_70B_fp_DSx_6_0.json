It's an exclusive or, meaning that both states cannot be true at the same time.\n\n2. \"The grommet is not plopped\" - This statement tells us that the grommet is not in the plopped state.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. Since the grommet is not plopped, and it can only be either sploffed or plopped, we can conclude that the grommet must be sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
