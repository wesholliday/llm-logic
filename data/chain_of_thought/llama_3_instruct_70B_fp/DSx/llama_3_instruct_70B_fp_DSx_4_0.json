It's possible that both conditions are true, but we can't conclude that from this statement alone.\n\n2. \"The fribble is not crinked\" - This statement tells us that the fribble is definitely not crinked.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from these two statements. Since the fribble is not crinked (from statement 2), and it must be either snurgled or crinked (from statement 1), the only remaining possibility is that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
