It's possible that both conditions are true, but we can't conclude that from this statement alone.\n\n2. \"The sneg is not sproted\" - This statement tells us that the sneg is definitely not sproted.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from both statements. Since the sneg is not sproted (from statement 2), and we know that either it's crampled or sproted (from statement 1), the only possibility left is that the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
