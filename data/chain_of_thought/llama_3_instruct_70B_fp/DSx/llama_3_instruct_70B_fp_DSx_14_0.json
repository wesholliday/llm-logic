It's possible that both conditions are true, but we can't conclude that from this statement alone.\n\n2. \"The clug is not snugged\" - This statement tells us that the clug is definitely not snugged.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from these two statements. Since the clug is not snugged (from statement 2), and we know that either it's fleeked or snugged (from statement 1), the only possibility left is that the clug is fleeked. If it weren't fleeked, then neither condition in statement 1 would be true, which would contradict the \"or\" statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
