It's possible that both are true, but we can't conclude that from this statement alone.\n\n2. \"The twonk is not plinked\" - This statement tells us that the first option in the \"or\" statement is false.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince the twonk is not plinked, and we know that either it's plinked or varnished, the only remaining option is that it must be varnished. If it weren't varnished, the \"or\" statement would be false, which would contradict the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
