Either the glip is slogged or it is tragged (This is an \"or\" statement, which means that at least one of the options must be true. It's possible that both are true, but we can't be certain of that.)\n2. The glip is not tragged (This statement tells us that the second option from the first premise is definitely not true.)\n\nNow, let's think about what we can conclude from these two premises. If the glip is not tragged, and it must be either slogged or tragged, then the only remaining option is that the glip is slogged. \n\nAnswer: yes",
