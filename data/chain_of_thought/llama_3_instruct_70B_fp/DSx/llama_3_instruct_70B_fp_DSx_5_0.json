It's an \"or\" statement, which means that if one condition is false, the other must be true.\n\n2. \"The zinger is not smoogled\" - This statement tells us that the zinger is not smoogled.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. Since the zinger is not smoogled (from statement 2), and we know that either it's fraggled or smoogled (from statement 1), we can conclude that the zinger must be fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
