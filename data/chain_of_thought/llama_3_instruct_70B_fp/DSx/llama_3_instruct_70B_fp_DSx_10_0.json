It's possible that both are true, but we can't conclude that from this statement alone.\n2. \"The wug is not garpled\" - This statement tells us that the wug is definitely not garpled.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from these two statements. Since the wug is not garpled, and we know that either it's sproinged or garpled, the only remaining option is that the wug is sproinged. If it weren't sproinged, then the first statement would be false, which would mean that the wug is both not sproinged and not garpled, contradicting the \"or\" statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
