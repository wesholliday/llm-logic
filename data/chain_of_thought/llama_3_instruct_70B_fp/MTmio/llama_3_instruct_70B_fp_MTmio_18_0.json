            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. 'The truck might not have been metal' implies that there is a possibility that the truck was not metal.\n2. 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal' is a conditional statement. It means that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. But it doesn't provide any information about the doll's material if the truck was not metal.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\na. The doll was plastic: In this case, the truck must have been metal (from statement 2).\nb. The doll was not plastic: In this case, we can't conclude anything about the truck's material from statement 2.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the truck might not have been metal. If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal (from statement 2), which contradicts statement 1. Therefore, the doll cannot be plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
