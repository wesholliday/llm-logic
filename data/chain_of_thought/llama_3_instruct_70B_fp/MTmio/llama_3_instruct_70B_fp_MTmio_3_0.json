            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"The book might not be a mystery novel\" - This statement implies that there is a possibility that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\n2. \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\" - This statement implies that if James wrote the book, it must be a mystery novel. In other words, if James wrote the book, it cannot be anything other than a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the book was written by James, then according to statement 2, it must be a mystery novel. But statement 1 says that the book might not be a mystery novel. This means that if the book was written by James, it would contradict statement 1, which says that the book might not be a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the book was not written by James, because if it was, it would have to be a mystery novel, which contradicts the possibility that it might not be a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: yes",
