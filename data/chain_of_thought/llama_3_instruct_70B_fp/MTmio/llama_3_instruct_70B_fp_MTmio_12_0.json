It means that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy's going to the zoo is a certainty.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo (by statement 2). But we know that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo (by statement 1). This implies that Joe cannot have gone to the park, because if he did, Lucy would have gone to the zoo, which contradicts the possibility that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: yes",
