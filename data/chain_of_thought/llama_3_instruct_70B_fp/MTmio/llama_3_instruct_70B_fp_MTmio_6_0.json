'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta' is a conditional statement. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob definitely chose pasta. But if Sue didn't choose pizza, we can't conclude anything about Bob's choice.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta (by statement 2). But we know Bob might not have chosen pasta (by statement 1). This means Sue cannot have chosen pizza, because if she did, Bob would have chosen pasta, contradicting statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
