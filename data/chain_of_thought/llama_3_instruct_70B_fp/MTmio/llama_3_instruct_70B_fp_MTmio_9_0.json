            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. 'Mark might not have bought the blue shirt' implies that it's possible Mark didn't buy the blue shirt.\n2. 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement. If the condition 'Lisa bought the red shirt' is true, then the conclusion 'Mark must have bought the blue shirt' must also be true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Lisa did buy the red shirt, then according to statement 2, Mark must have bought the blue shirt. But this contradicts statement 1, which says Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. This means that the assumption 'Lisa bought the red shirt' leads to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the assumption 'Lisa bought the red shirt' must be false, which means Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
