'If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball' is a conditional statement. It means that if Tom watched football, then it's certain that Jen watched basketball.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Tom watched football, then according to statement 2, Jen must have watched basketball.
