'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry' is a conditional statement. If the cake was chocolate, then we can conclude that the muffins were blueberry. However, if the cake was not chocolate, we cannot make any conclusion about the muffins.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry (by statement 2). But we know that the muffins might not have been blueberry (by statement 1). This means that the assumption \"the cake was chocolate\" leads to a contradiction. Therefore, we can conclude that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
