            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\" implies that it's possible Sue was not at the wedding.\n2. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" is a conditional statement. It means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue's presence is guaranteed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Mary was at the wedding, then according to statement 2, Sue must have been at the wedding. But statement 1 says Sue might not have been at the wedding. This means that if Mary was at the wedding, statement 1 would be false, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, to avoid this contradiction, we can conclude that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
