If the vampire was awake, it necessarily means the mummy was awake.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake (by statement 2). But we know the mummy might not have been awake (by statement 1). This means that the vampire cannot have been awake, because if it were, the mummy would have been awake, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
