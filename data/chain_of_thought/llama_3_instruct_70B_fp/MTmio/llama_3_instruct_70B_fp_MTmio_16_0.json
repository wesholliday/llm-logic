            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. 'The pants might not have been denim' implies that there is a possibility that the pants were not denim.\n2. 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim' is a conditional statement. It means that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are definitely denim. But it doesn't provide any information about the shirt being cotton or not.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim (by statement 2). But statement 1 says the pants might not have been denim, which contradicts this scenario. So, the shirt cannot be cotton.\n- If the shirt is not cotton, then we can't say anything about the pants (they might or might not be denim).\n\nIn both scenarios, we can conclude that the shirt is not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
