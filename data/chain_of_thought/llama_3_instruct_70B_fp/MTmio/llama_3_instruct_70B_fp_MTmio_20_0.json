'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow' is a conditional statement. If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. But if the apple was not red, we can't conclude anything about the banana's color.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow (by statement 2). But we know the banana might not have been yellow (by statement 1). This means the apple cannot be red, because if it were, the banana would have to be yellow, which contradicts the possibility that the banana might not have been yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
