            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The weather might be sunny or rainy\" implies that there are two possible outcomes for the weather: it could be sunny or it could be rainy. This is a disjunction, meaning one or the other (or possibly both) could be true.\n\nThe question is asking if we can infer that both \"The weather might be sunny\" and \"The weather might be rainy\" are true. In other words, can we break down the original disjunction into two separate statements, each asserting the possibility of one of the outcomes?\n\nLogically, this makes sense. If the weather might be sunny or rainy, then it's certainly true that the weather might be sunny (because it's one of the possible outcomes) and also true that the weather might be rainy (because it's the other possible outcome).\n\nAnswer: yes",
