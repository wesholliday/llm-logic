In this case, the argument has the form:\n\nEither A or B\nNot B\n\u2234 A\n\nWhere A is \"The cat is napping on the couch\" and B is \"The cat is playing in the bedroom\".\n\nThis form of argument is a classic example of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid argument form. The first premise presents two possibilities, and the second premise eliminates one of them. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
