            "content": "Explanation: To determine if an argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, we have a disjunctive syllogism, which is a type of argument that involves an \"either-or\" statement.\n\nThe first premise states that either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table. This sets up a disjunction, where one of the two options must be true.\n\nThe second premise denies one of the options, stating that the book is not resting on the table. This leaves only one option remaining, which is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nGiven the structure of the argument, if the premises are true, the conclusion necessarily follows. If it's true that either the book is on the shelf or it's resting on the table, and it's not resting on the table, then it must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
