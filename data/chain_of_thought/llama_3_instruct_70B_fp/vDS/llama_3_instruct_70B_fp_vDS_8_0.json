            "content": "Explanation: To determine if an argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, the argument has the following form:\n\nEither A or B\nNot B\n\u2234 A\n\nThis is a classic form of argument known as disjunctive syllogism. The first premise presents two possibilities: A or B. The second premise eliminates one of those possibilities: Not B. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is A, which is the conclusion.\n\nIn this specific argument, A represents \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" and B represents \"The remote control is hiding under the couch\". The first premise states that one of these two possibilities must be true. The second premise eliminates the possibility of B, leaving only A as the remaining option. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
