            "content": "Explanation: To determine if an argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, we have a disjunctive premise \"Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden\", which means that at least one of the two options must be true. The second premise \"Fido is not in the garden\" eliminates one of the options, leaving only \"Fido is inside\" as a possibility. \n\nIf Fido is not in the garden, and it's true that either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden, then it must be the case that Fido is inside. This is because the disjunctive premise ensures that one of the options must be true, and the second premise rules out the other option.\n\nAnswer: yes",
