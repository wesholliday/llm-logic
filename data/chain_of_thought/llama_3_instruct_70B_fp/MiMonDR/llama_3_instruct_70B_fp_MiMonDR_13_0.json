This statement does not provide any information about whether the meeting is scheduled or not. However, if the meeting might be cancelled, it implies that the meeting is already scheduled, because you can only cancel something that is already planned. Therefore, we can infer that the meeting is scheduled, and since it might be cancelled, we can also infer that it might be scheduled or cancelled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
