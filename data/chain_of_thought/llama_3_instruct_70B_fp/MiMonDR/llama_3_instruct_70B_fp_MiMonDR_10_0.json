            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The computer might be broken\" implies that there is a possibility that the computer is broken. This statement does not provide any information about the possibility of the computer working. However, if we consider the two possible states of the computer (working or broken), and we know that it might be broken, then it is also possible that it might be working (since it's not definitely broken). This is because \"might be broken\" implies some level of uncertainty, and in the presence of uncertainty, the opposite possibility (it might be working) cannot be ruled out.\n\nAnswer: yes",
