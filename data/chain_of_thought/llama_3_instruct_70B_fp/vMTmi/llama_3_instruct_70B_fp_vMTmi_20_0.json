            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationships between the premises and the conclusion. The first premise is a conditional statement, \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\", which can be represented as \"R \u2192 Y\". The second premise is \"The banana might not have been yellow\", which can be represented as \"\u00acY\" (not Y). The conclusion is \"The apple was not red\", which can be represented as \"\u00acR\".\n\nTo evaluate the validity of the argument, we need to consider whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In this case, we have a conditional statement (R \u2192 Y) and its negation (\u00acY). If we know that the banana might not have been yellow (\u00acY), we can infer that the condition \"R\" (the apple was red) cannot be true, because if it were true, the banana would have been yellow (by the first premise). Therefore, we can conclude that the apple was not red (\u00acR).\n\nAnswer: yes",
