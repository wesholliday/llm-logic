            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationships between the premises and the conclusion. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q is \"Bob chose pasta\".\n\nThe second premise is \"Bob might not have chosen pasta\", which can be represented as \"\u00acQ\" (not Q).\n\nThe conclusion is \"Sue did not choose pizza\", which can be represented as \"\u00acP\".\n\nNow, let's see if we can logically derive the conclusion from the premises. From the first premise, we know that if P is true, then Q must be true. From the second premise, we know that Q might not be true (\u00acQ). If Q is not true, then the conditional statement \"P \u2192 Q\" implies that P cannot be true (\u00acP).\n\nIn other words, if Bob didn't choose pasta (\u00acQ), then Sue couldn't have chosen pizza (\u00acP), because if she did, Bob would have chosen pasta (Q). This is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
