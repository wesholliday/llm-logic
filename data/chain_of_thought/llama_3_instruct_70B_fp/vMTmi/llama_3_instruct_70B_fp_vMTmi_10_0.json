            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\" This can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" or \"P \u2192 Q\".\n\nThe second premise is \"The cat might not have been outside,\" which can be represented as \"\u00acQ\" (not Q).\n\nThe conclusion is \"The dog was not inside,\" which can be represented as \"\u00acP\" (not P).\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In this case, we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ). This is a classic case of modus tollens, which is a valid argument form.\n\nModus tollens states that if we have \"P \u2192 Q\" and \"\u00acQ\", we can infer \"\u00acP\". This is exactly what we have in this argument. Therefore, the conclusion \"The dog was not inside\" (\u00acP) follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
