            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationships between the premises and the conclusion. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 M\", where P represents \"the doll was plastic\" and M represents \"the truck was metal\".\n\nThe second premise is \"The truck might not have been metal\", which can be represented as \"\u00acM\" (not M).\n\nThe conclusion is \"The doll was not plastic\", which can be represented as \"\u00acP\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\n1. If P \u2192 M (first premise)\n2. \u00acM (second premise)\n3. \u2234 \u00acP (conclusion)\n\nTo be logically valid, the conclusion must follow necessarily from the premises. In this case, we can use modus tollens, a valid inference rule, to derive the conclusion:\n\n1. P \u2192 M (first premise)\n2. \u00acM (second premise)\n3. \u2234 \u00acP (by modus tollens, since \u00acM implies \u00acP)\n\nSince we can derive the conclusion using a valid inference rule, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
