            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationships between the premises and the conclusion. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball\".\n\nThe second premise is \"Jen might not have watched basketball\", which can be represented as \"\u00acQ\" (not Q).\n\nThe conclusion is \"Tom did not watch football\", which can be represented as \"\u00acP\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\n1. If P \u2192 Q (first premise)\n2. \u00acQ (second premise)\n3. \u2234 \u00acP (conclusion)\n\nTo be logically valid, the conclusion must follow necessarily from the premises. In this case, if P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, it is reasonable to conclude that \u00acP, because if P were true, then Q would also be true (by the first premise), but since Q is not true (second premise), P cannot be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
