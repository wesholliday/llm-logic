            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationships between the premises and the conclusion. The first premise sets up a conditional statement: if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry. This implies that if the cake was chocolate, it necessarily follows that the muffins were blueberry.\n\nThe second premise introduces a possibility: the muffins might not have been blueberry. This suggests that it's possible that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nThe conclusion claims that the cake was not chocolate. To justify this conclusion, we need to see if it logically follows from the premises.\n\nIf the muffins might not have been blueberry, it means that the condition in the first premise (the muffins being blueberry) might not have been met. Since the first premise states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry, we can infer that if the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake could not have been chocolate.\n\nThis inference is based on the principle of modus tollens, which states that if A implies B, and B is false, then A must also be false. In this case, if the cake being chocolate implies the muffins being blueberry, and the muffins might not have been blueberry, then we can conclude that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
