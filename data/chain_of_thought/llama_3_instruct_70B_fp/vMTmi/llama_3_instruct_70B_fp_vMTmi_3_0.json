            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as \"If A, then B\" or \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"the book was written by James\" and B is \"the book must be a mystery novel\".\n\nThe second premise is \"The book might not be a mystery novel\", which can be represented as \"not B\" or \"\u00acB\".\n\nThe conclusion is \"The book was not written by James\", which can be represented as \"not A\" or \"\u00acA\".\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In this case, we have a conditional statement (A \u2192 B) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acB). This is a classic case of modus tollens, which is a valid argument form.\n\nModus tollens states that if A \u2192 B and \u00acB, then \u00acA. In this case, if the book was written by James implies that the book must be a mystery novel, and the book might not be a mystery novel, then it logically follows that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
