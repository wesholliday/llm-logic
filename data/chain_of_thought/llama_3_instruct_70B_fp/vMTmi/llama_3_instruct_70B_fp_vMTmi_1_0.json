            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationships between the premises and the conclusion. The first premise sets up a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue's presence is guaranteed.\n\nThe second premise introduces a possibility: \"Sue might not have been at the wedding.\" This suggests that Sue's presence is not certain.\n\nThe conclusion drawn is \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" To justify this conclusion, we need to see if it logically follows from the premises.\n\nIf Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding (first premise). However, Sue might not have been at the wedding (second premise). This creates a contradiction, as if Mary was at the wedding, Sue's presence would be guaranteed, but the second premise suggests that Sue's presence is uncertain.\n\nTo resolve this contradiction, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding, as this would mean that Sue's presence is not guaranteed, which aligns with the second premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
