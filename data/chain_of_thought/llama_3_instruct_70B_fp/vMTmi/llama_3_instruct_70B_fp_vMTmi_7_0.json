            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion. The first premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. This implies that if Alex finished, Chris also finished. The second premise states that Chris might not have finished the race, which means it's possible that Chris didn't finish.\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that if Alex finished, Chris would have finished. But the second premise tells us that Chris might not have finished. This creates a contradiction, as if Chris didn't finish, then Alex couldn't have finished either (according to the first premise). Therefore, we can conclude that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nThe argument's validity relies on the correct application of modus tollens, a logical rule that states: if P \u2192 Q and not Q, then not P. In this case, P represents \"Alex finished the race\" and Q represents \"Chris finished the race\". The first premise is P \u2192 Q, and the second premise is equivalent to not Q. Applying modus tollens, we get not P, which means Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
