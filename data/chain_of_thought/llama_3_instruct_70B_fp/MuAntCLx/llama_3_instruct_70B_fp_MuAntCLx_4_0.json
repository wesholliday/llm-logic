It does not provide any information about the bimboozle being in the flump quazzle. \n\nThe added phrase \"and in the flump quazzle\" is not supported by the original statement, and we cannot logically conclude that the bimboozle must be in the flump quazzle based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
