In this case, we are not given any information about the relationship between \"fribble\" and \"zump\" or whether \"zump\" is a necessary property of the plimp.\n\nWithout additional context or information, we cannot logically conclude that the plimp must be both fribble and zump solely based on the fact that it must be fribble.\n\nAnswer: no",
