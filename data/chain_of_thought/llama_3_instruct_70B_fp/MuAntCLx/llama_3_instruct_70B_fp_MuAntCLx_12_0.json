The added phrase \"and be wozzle flump\" introduces new information that is not present in the original statement. \n\nThere is no logical connection between the original statement and the added phrase, and we cannot infer the added phrase from the original statement. In other words, the original statement does not provide any information about \"wozzle flump\", so we cannot conclude that it must be true.\n\nAnswer: no",
