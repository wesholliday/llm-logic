The added phrase \"and quimble quibble\" introduces new information that is not necessarily related to the original statement. \n\nIn logic, adding new information to a statement can change its meaning and validity. In this case, we cannot infer the new statement \"The snorkel must be in the wumble and quimble quibble\" solely based on the original statement, as it introduces an additional condition that is not implied or entailed by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
