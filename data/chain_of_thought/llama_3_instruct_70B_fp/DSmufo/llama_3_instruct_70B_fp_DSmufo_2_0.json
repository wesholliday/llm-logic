            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" - This statement negates the possibility that the book must be on the table. It doesn't say the book can't be on the table, but rather that it's not necessarily on the table.\n\n2. \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf\" - This statement presents two possibilities: the book must be on the table, or it is on the shelf. The \"or\" here is an inclusive or, meaning that both options could be true, but at least one of them must be true.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements. If it's not the case that the book must be on the table (from statement 1), then the only remaining possibility from statement 2 is that the book is on the shelf. This is because statement 2 ensures that at least one of the options is true, and since the first option (book must be on the table) is negated, the second option (book is on the shelf) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
