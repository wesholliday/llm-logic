The first statement says \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor\", which can be rephrased as \"The missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor\". The second statement says \"Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box\", which implies that there are only two possible locations for the missing puzzle piece: either it's blending in on the floor or it's in the box.\n\nNow, if we know that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor (from the first statement), and we also know that it must be in one of the two locations (from the second statement), then the only remaining possibility is that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
