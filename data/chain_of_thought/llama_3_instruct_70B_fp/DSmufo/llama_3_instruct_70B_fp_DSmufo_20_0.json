The first statement says \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\", which means the sunglasses do not have to be perched on her head. The second statement says \"Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag\", which means that one of these two options must be true.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. Since the first statement says the sunglasses don't have to be perched on her head, and the second statement says it's either on her head or in her bag, we can conclude that the only other option left is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
