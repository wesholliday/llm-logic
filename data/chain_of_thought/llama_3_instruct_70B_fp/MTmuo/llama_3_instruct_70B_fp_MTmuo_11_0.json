If the cake was chocolate, then it would imply that the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the cake was chocolate, then according to statement 2, the muffins must have been blueberry. But statement 1 says that's not the case. This means that the assumption \"the cake was chocolate\" leads to a contradiction. Therefore, we can conclude that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
