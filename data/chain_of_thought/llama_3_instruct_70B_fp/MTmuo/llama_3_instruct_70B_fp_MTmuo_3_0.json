            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel\" - This statement implies that the book may not be a mystery novel, or it's possible that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\n2. \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\" - This statement sets up a conditional relationship between the book being written by James and the book being a mystery novel. It means that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If the book was written by James, then according to statement 2, it must be a mystery novel. But statement 1 says it's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel. This implies that the book was not written by James, because if it was, it would have to be a mystery novel, which contradicts statement 1.\n\n- If the book was not written by James, then statement 2 does not apply, and we can't conclude anything about the book's genre. However, this scenario does not contradict statement 1.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can infer that the book was not written by James, because if it was, it would have to be a mystery novel, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
