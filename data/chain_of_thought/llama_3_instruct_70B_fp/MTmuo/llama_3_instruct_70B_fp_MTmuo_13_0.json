            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue\" - This statement implies that the truck's color is not necessarily blue. It doesn't mean the truck couldn't be blue, but rather that we can't conclude it must be blue.\n\n2. \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\" - This is a conditional statement. If the car is red, then the truck must be blue. But what if the car is not red? We can't make any conclusions about the truck's color in that case.\n\nNow, let's analyze the desired inference: \"The car was not red\". If the car was indeed red, then according to statement 2, the truck must have been blue. But statement 1 tells us that the truck's color is not necessarily blue. This means that if the car was red, we would have a contradiction. Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, we must assume that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
