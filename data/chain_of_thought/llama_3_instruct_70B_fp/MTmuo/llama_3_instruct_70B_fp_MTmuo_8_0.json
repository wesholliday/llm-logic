It means that if the vampire was awake, then it's certain that the mummy was awake.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the vampire was awake, then according to statement 2, the mummy must have been awake. But statement 1 says that it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake. This means that the assumption \"the vampire was awake\" leads to a contradiction. Therefore, we can conclude that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
