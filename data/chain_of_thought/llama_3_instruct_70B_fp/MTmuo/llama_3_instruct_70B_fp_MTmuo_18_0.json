            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\" - This statement implies that the truck might not have been metal, or it's possible that the truck was not metal.\n\n2. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" - This is a conditional statement. If the doll was plastic, then it necessarily implies that the truck must have been metal.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the doll was plastic, then according to statement 2, the truck must have been metal. But statement 1 says that it's not the case that the truck must have been metal. This means that the doll cannot be plastic, because if it were, then the truck would have to be metal, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
