If the condition \"Ben ate pasta\" is true, then the conclusion \"Kate must have eaten salad\" must also be true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Ben ate pasta, then according to statement 2, Kate must have eaten salad. But statement 1 says that it's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad. This means that Ben cannot have eaten pasta, because if he did, Kate would have had to eat salad, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
