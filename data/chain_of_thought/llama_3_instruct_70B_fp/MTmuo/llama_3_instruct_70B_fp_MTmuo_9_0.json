            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" - This statement implies that Mark may or may not have bought the blue shirt, but it's not a necessity.\n\n2. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" - This is a conditional statement. If the condition \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true, then the conclusion \"Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" follows.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Lisa bought the red shirt, then according to statement 2, Mark must have bought the blue shirt. But statement 1 says that it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This means that the condition \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" cannot be true, because if it were, it would lead to a contradiction with statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
