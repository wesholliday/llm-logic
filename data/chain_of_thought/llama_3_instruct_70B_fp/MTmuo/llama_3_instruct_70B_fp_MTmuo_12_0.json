            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" can be rewritten as \"Lucy did not have to go to the zoo\" or \"Lucy may not have gone to the zoo\".\n2. \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" is a conditional statement. If the condition \"Joe went to the park\" is true, then the conclusion \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" should also be true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Joe did go to the park, then according to statement 2, Lucy must have gone to the zoo. But statement 1 tells us that Lucy did not have to go to the zoo. This means that the condition \"Joe went to the park\" cannot be true, because if it were, it would imply that Lucy must have gone to the zoo, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
