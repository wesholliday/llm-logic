This means that if Alex finished the race, Chris must have finished the race as well.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Alex finished the race, then according to statement 2, Chris must have finished the race. But statement 1 tells us that it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race. This means that Alex cannot have finished the race, because if Alex had finished, Chris would have had to finish as well, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
