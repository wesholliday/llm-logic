            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow\" - This statement implies that the banana might not have been yellow, or it's possible that the banana was not yellow.\n2. \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" - This is a conditional statement. If the apple was red, then it necessarily follows that the banana must have been yellow.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the apple was red, then according to statement 2, the banana must have been yellow. But statement 1 says that it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow. This means that the assumption \"the apple was red\" leads to a contradiction. Therefore, we can conclude that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
