            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding\" - This statement implies that Sue's presence at the wedding is not a necessity or a certainty.\n\n2. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" - This statement sets up a conditional relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue's presence becomes a necessity.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Mary was at the wedding, then according to statement 2, Sue must have been at the wedding. But statement 1 tells us that Sue's presence is not a necessity. This means that Mary cannot have been at the wedding, because if she was, then Sue's presence would be necessary, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
