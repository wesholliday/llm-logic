From statement 2, we know that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter. But we know the robot did not visit Jupiter, so the only way this can be true is if the alien did not visit Mars. If the alien had visited Mars, then the robot would have visited Jupiter, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nAnswer: yes",
