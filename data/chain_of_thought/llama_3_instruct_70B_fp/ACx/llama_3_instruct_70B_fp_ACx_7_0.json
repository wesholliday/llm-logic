However, the conditional statement only guarantees that if A is true, then B must be true, but it does not guarantee the converse - that if B is true, then A must be true.\n\nIn other words, just because the whiffle tinked, it does not necessarily mean that it was shanked. There could be other reasons why the whiffle tinked.\n\nAnswer: no",
