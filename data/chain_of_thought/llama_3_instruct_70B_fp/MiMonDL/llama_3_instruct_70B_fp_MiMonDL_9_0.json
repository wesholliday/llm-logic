            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can make this inference, let's break down the original statement and the potential inference.\n\nThe original statement is \"The package might be delivered.\" This statement implies that there is a possibility that the package will be delivered.\n\nThe potential inference is \"The package might be delivered or delayed.\" This statement implies that there are two possibilities: the package might be delivered, or it might be delayed.\n\nNotice that the original statement is a subset of the potential inference. The original statement only mentions the possibility of delivery, while the potential inference includes this possibility and adds another possibility (delay).\n\nIn general, if we know that something might happen, we can also infer that it might happen or something else might happen. This is because the original statement only provides a minimum possibility, and the potential inference is simply adding more possibilities to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
