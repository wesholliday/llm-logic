            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The keys might be in the drawer\" implies that there is a possibility that the keys are in the drawer, but it does not provide any information about other locations. The statement \"The keys might be in the drawer or on the table\" is a broader statement that includes the original possibility (keys in the drawer) and adds an additional possibility (keys on the table). \n\nSince the original statement does not rule out the possibility of the keys being on the table, and the new statement is a logical extension of the original one, we can infer the new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
