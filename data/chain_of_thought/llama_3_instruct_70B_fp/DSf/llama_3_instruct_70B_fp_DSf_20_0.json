The first statement is \"Either the sunglasses are perched on her head or they are in her bag.\" This is an \"or\" statement, which means that one or both of the options must be true. The second statement is \"The sunglasses aren't perched on her head.\" This statement tells us that one of the options in the first statement is definitely not true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities. If the sunglasses aren't perched on her head, then the only other option left is that they are in her bag. If they weren't in her bag, then the first statement would be false, because it would mean that neither option is true. But we know the first statement is true, so the only possibility left is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
