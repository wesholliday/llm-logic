The first statement is a disjunction, which means it presents two possibilities: the remote control is either under the couch or on the coffee table. The second statement negates one of those possibilities, stating that the remote control is not under the couch. \n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. If the remote control is not under the couch, and it's either under the couch or on the coffee table, then the only remaining possibility is that it's on the coffee table. This is because the first statement presents an exhaustive list of possibilities (it's either under the couch or on the coffee table), and the second statement eliminates one of those possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes",
