The first statement is a disjunction, which means it presents two possibilities: the umbrella is either in the closet or in the car. The second statement negates one of those possibilities, stating that the umbrella is not in the closet. \n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. If the umbrella is not in the closet, and we know it's either in the closet or in the car, then the only remaining possibility is that the umbrella is in the car. This is because the first statement presents an exhaustive list of possibilities (it's either in the closet or in the car), and the second statement eliminates one of those possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes",
