It says that either the milk is chilling in the fridge or it's on the counter. This implies that these are the only two possible locations of the milk.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the milk isn't chilling in the fridge. This means we can eliminate the first option from the disjunction. Since the disjunction only provides two options, and one of them is eliminated, we are left with the other option.\n\nAnswer: yes",
