The first statement is \"Either the shoes are lined up by the door or they are in the closet.\" This is an \"or\" statement, which means that one or both of the conditions must be true. The second statement is \"The shoes aren't lined up by the door.\" This statement tells us that the first condition in the \"or\" statement is false.\n\nSince the first condition is false, and the \"or\" statement requires at least one of the conditions to be true, we can conclude that the second condition \"they are in the closet\" must be true. This is because if the first condition is false, and the \"or\" statement is still true, then the second condition must be true to make the entire statement true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
