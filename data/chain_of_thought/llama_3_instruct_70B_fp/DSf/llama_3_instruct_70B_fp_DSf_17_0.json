It says that either the scarf is draped on the coat rack or it's stuffed in my backpack. This implies that these are the only two possible locations of the scarf.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the scarf isn't draped on the coat rack. This means we can eliminate the first option from the disjunction.\n\nSince the disjunction only presented two options, and we've eliminated one of them, we're left with the other option: the scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
