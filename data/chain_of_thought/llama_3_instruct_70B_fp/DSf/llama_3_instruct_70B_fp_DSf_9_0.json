The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are only two possible locations for the missing puzzle piece: on the floor or in the box. \n\nNow, statement 2 tells us that the missing puzzle piece is not on the floor. \n\nSince we know that the missing puzzle piece must be in one of the two locations (from statement 1), and it's not on the floor (from statement 2), the only remaining possibility is that it must be in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
