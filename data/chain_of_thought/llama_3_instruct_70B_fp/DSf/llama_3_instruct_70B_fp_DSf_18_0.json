The first statement is a disjunction, which means it presents two possibilities: the notebook is either on the nightstand or in the drawer. The second statement negates one of those possibilities, stating that the notebook is not on the nightstand. \n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. If the notebook is not on the nightstand, and it's either on the nightstand or in the drawer, then the only remaining possibility is that the notebook is in the drawer. This is because the first statement ensures that the notebook is in one of those two locations, and the second statement eliminates the nightstand as an option.\n\nAnswer: yes",
