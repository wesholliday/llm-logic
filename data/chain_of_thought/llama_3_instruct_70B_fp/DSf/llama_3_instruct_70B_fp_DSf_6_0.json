            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. The first statement is \"Either the phone is ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room.\" This is an \"or\" statement, which implies that one or both of the options must be true. The second statement is \"The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen.\" This statement tells us that the first option, \"the phone is ringing in the kitchen,\" is false.\n\nSince the first option is false, and the \"or\" statement implies that one or both options must be true, we can conclude that the second option, \"it is in the living room,\" must be true. This is because if the first option is false, the only way the \"or\" statement can still be true is if the second option is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
