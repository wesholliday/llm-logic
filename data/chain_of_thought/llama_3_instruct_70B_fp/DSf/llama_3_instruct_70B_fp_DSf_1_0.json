It's possible that both options are true, but we can't conclude that from this statement alone.\n\n2. \"Fido is not in the garden\" - This statement tells us that the first option in the \"or\" statement is false. Since the \"or\" statement requires at least one option to be true, and the first option is false, the second option must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
