This implies that Mary's presence at the wedding is a sufficient condition for Sue's presence.\n2. Sue was not at the wedding. This is a direct statement that contradicts the conclusion of the first statement.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Mary was at the wedding, then according to statement 1, Sue would also be at the wedding. But statement 2 tells us that Sue was not at the wedding. This means that the assumption \"Mary was at the wedding\" leads to a contradiction. Therefore, we can conclude that the assumption must be false, and Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
