If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\nThis is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"A \u2192 R\", where A is \"the alien visited Mars\" and R is \"the robot visited Jupiter\".\n\n2. The robot did not visit Jupiter.\nThis statement can be represented as \"\u00acR\", where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the robot did not visit Jupiter (\u00acR). If we assume that the alien visited Mars (A), then according to statement 1, the robot would have visited Jupiter (R). But this contradicts statement 2, which says the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that the alien visited Mars (A) must be false. This means that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
