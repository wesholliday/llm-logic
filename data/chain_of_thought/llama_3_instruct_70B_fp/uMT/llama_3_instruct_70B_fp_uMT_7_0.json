We are told that \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race as well. This can be represented as \"Alex finished \u2192 Chris finished\".\n\nWe are also told that \"Chris did not finish the race\". This means that the statement \"Chris finished\" is false.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implication \"Alex finished \u2192 Chris finished\". Since \"Chris finished\" is false, the only way this implication can be true is if \"Alex finished\" is also false. If \"Alex finished\" were true, then \"Chris finished\" would have to be true as well, but we know that's not the case.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
