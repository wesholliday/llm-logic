We are told that \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Ben ate pasta \u2192 Kate ate salad\". This means that if the condition \"Ben ate pasta\" is true, then the consequence \"Kate ate salad\" must also be true.\n\nWe are also told that \"Kate did not eat salad\". This means that the consequence \"Kate ate salad\" is false.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conditional statement again. If the consequence \"Kate ate salad\" is false, then the condition \"Ben ate pasta\" must also be false. This is because if \"Ben ate pasta\" were true, then \"Kate ate salad\" would have to be true, but we know that's not the case.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
