            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. The first statement says \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\" or \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"the shirt was cotton\" and B is \"the pants were denim\". \n\nThe second statement says \"the pants were not denim\", which can be represented as \"not B\". \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that the shirt was not cotton (not A) from the given statements. \n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if A is true, then B must be true. But the second statement tells us that B is not true. Therefore, we can conclude that A cannot be true, because if A were true, then B would have to be true, but we know that B is not true. \n\nAnswer: yes",
