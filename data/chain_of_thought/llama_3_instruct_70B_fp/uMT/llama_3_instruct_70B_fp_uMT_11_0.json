If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\nThis is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the cake was chocolate\" and B is \"the muffins were blueberry\".\n\n2. The muffins were not blueberry.\nThis statement tells us that B is false.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince B is false, and we know that \"If A, then B\", we can conclude that A must be false as well. If A were true, then B would have to be true, but we know that B is false. Therefore, A must be false to maintain the validity of the conditional statement.\n\nIn this case, A is \"the cake was chocolate\", so we can infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
