Erin did not take a train. This statement tells us that Erin did not take a train.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf Sam took a plane, then according to statement 1, Erin should have taken a train. But statement 2 contradicts this, saying Erin did not take a train. This means that the assumption \"Sam took a plane\" leads to a contradiction. Therefore, we can conclude that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
