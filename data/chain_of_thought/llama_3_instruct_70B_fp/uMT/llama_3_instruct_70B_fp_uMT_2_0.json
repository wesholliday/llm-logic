The unicorn was not in the forest. (Fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the griffin was in the forest, it would imply the unicorn was also in the forest. However, statement 2 tells us that the unicorn was not in the forest. This means that the condition for the implication in statement 1 is not met, i.e., the griffin being in the forest.\n\nSince the implication is not true, we can conclude that the griffin was not in the forest, because if it were, the unicorn would have been in the forest, which is not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
