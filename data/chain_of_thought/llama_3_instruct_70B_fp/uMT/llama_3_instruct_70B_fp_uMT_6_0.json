We are told that \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This implies a conditional relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice. In other words, if Sue chose pizza, it necessarily means Bob chose pasta.\n\nWe are also told that \"Bob did not choose pasta.\" This is a direct statement about Bob's choice.\n\nNow, let's combine these two pieces of information. If Bob did not choose pasta, and we know that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta, it means that Sue cannot have chosen pizza. Because if Sue had chosen pizza, Bob would have chosen pasta, but we know Bob didn't choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
