We are told that \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This implies that if James wrote the book, it must be a mystery novel. However, we are also told that \"the book is not a mystery novel.\" This means that the book does not belong to the mystery novel genre.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation.
