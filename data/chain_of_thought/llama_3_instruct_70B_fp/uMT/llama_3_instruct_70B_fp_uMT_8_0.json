This implies a conditional relationship between the vampire's state and the mummy's state. If the vampire is awake, it guarantees that the mummy is also awake.\n2. The mummy was not awake. This statement provides a fact about the mummy's state.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince the mummy was not awake, and the first statement implies that if the vampire is awake, the mummy must be awake, we can conclude that the vampire cannot be awake.
