            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given information step by step. We are told that \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"Tom watches football \u2192 Jen watches basketball\". This means that if Tom watches football, then it must be the case that Jen watches basketball.\n\nWe are also told that \"Jen did not watch basketball\". This is a negation of the consequent in the conditional statement. Since Jen did not watch basketball, we can conclude that the antecedent (Tom watches football) must also be false. This is because if Tom had watched football, then Jen would have watched basketball, but we know that's not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
