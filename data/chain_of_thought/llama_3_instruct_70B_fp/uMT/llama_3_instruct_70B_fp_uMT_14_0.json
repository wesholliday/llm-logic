(This is a conditional statement, implying that if the bear is in the cave, it necessarily means the wolf is in the den.)\n2. The wolf was not in the den. (This is a direct statement, telling us that the wolf is not in the den.)\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nSince the wolf is not in the den, and the first statement implies that if the bear is in the cave, the wolf must be in the den, we can conclude that the bear cannot be in the cave. If the bear were in the cave, it would mean the wolf is in the den, but we know that's not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
