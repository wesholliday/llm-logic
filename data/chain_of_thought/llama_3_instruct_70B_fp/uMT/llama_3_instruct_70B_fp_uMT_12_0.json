(Fact)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if Joe went to the park, Lucy would have gone to the zoo. However, statement 2 tells us that Lucy did not go to the zoo. This means that the condition \"Joe went to the park\" cannot be true, because if it were, Lucy would have gone to the zoo, which is not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
