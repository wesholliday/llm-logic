            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"the car was red\" and B is \"the truck was blue\". The second statement is a negation: \"the truck was not blue\", which can be represented as \"not B\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if A is true, then B must be true. But the second statement tells us that B is actually false. This means that the condition \"A\" (the car was red) cannot be true, because if it were, then B (the truck was blue) would also be true, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
