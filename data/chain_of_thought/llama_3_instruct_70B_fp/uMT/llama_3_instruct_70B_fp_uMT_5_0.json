            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be represented as \"If A, then B\", where A is \"Jeff played basketball\" and B is \"Amy played tennis\". The second statement is a negation: \"Amy did not play tennis\", which can be represented as \"not B\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if A is true, then B must also be true. However, the second statement tells us that B is actually false. This means that the condition \"If A, then B\" cannot be true, because B is false. Therefore, we can infer that A must also be false, because if A were true, then B would have to be true, but we know that B is false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
