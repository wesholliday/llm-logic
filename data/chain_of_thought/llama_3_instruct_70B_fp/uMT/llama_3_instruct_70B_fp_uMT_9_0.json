            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given information step by step. We are told that \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\" or \"A \u2192 B\", where A is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and B is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\". \n\nWe are also told that \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\", which means that B is false. \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt (i.e., A is false). \n\nSince B is false, and A \u2192 B, we can conclude that A must be false to maintain the validity of the conditional statement. If A were true, then B would have to be true, but we know B is false. Therefore, A must be false to avoid a contradiction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
