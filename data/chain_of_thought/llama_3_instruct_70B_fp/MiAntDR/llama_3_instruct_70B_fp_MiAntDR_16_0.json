            "content": "Explanation: The original statement says \"The room might be cleaned daily or upon request\". This implies that there are two possible scenarios: the room might be cleaned daily, or the room might be cleaned upon request. Since \"or\" is used to connect the two scenarios, it means that either one or both of them could be true. Therefore, it is possible that the room might be cleaned upon request, because it is one of the two scenarios mentioned.\n\nAnswer: yes",
