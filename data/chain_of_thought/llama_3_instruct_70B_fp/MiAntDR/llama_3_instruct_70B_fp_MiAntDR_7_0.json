This statement does not provide any information about which outcome is more likely, but it does suggest that both possibilities exist.\n\nIn this case, we can infer that the exam might be easy because it is one of the two possibilities mentioned in the original statement. The statement does not rule out the possibility of the exam being easy, and in fact, it explicitly mentions it as a possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
