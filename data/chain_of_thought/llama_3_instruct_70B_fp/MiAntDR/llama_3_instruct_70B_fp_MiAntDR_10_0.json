            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The document might be signed or notarized\" implies that there are two possible actions that could be taken with the document: it might be signed, or it might be notarized, or possibly both. The use of \"or\" in this context suggests that these are alternative possibilities, and that the document might undergo one or both of these actions.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the document might be notarized because notarization is one of the possible actions mentioned in the original statement. The fact that signing is also mentioned as a possibility does not affect the possibility of notarization.\n\nAnswer: yes",
