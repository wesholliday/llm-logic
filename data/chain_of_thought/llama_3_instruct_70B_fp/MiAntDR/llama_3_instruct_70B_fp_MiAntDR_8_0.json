            "content": "Explanation: The given statement says \"The restaurant might be closed on Mondays or open for limited hours\". This is a disjunction, meaning it's saying that one of two possibilities might be true. The possibilities are \"The restaurant might be closed on Mondays\" and \"The restaurant might be open for limited hours\". Since the statement says \"or\", it's implying that at least one of these possibilities might be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The restaurant might be open for limited hours\" is one of the possible scenarios.\n\nAnswer: yes",
