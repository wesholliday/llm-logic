This new information does not necessarily follow the original implication. In fact, being misrouted might be a reason why the package will not arrive today, despite having shipped. \n\nThe correct inference would be to question the original implication, as the misrouting might be an obstacle to the package arriving today. \n\nAnswer: no",
