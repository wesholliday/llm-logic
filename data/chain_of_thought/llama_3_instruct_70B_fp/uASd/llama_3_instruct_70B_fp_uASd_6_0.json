It suggests that the loud noise from your screaming is the cause of the pain. However, if I am wearing earplugs, they would likely reduce the intensity of the sound that reaches my ears. Earplugs are designed to block or reduce sound, so it's reasonable to assume that they would mitigate the effect of your screaming on my ears.\n\nAnswer: no",
