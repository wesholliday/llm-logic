Typically, a pilot light is necessary for an oven to function properly. If the pilot light is out, it's likely that the oven is not functioning correctly or not producing heat.\n\nGiven this, we cannot infer that the kitchen is warm simply because the oven is on and the pilot light is out. The oven being on is not sufficient to guarantee the kitchen is warm if the pilot light is out, as the oven may not be producing heat.\n\nAnswer: no",
