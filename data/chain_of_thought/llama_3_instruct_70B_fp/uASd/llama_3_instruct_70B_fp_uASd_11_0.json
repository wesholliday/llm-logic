However, it does not take into account other factors that might contribute to tiredness, such as physical activity or hard labor. \n\nWhen we add the condition of doing hard labor, it's possible that the physical exertion could still cause tiredness, even if we get enough sleep. The original statement only guarantees that sleep is enough to prevent tiredness, but it doesn't guarantee that other factors won't cause tiredness.\n\nAnswer: no",
