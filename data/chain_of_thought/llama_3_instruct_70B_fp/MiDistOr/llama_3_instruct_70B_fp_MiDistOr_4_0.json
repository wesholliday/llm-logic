            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or be cancelled\" implies that there are two possible outcomes: the meeting starts at 2 PM, or it gets cancelled. The phrase \"or be cancelled\" suggests that cancellation is an alternative to the meeting starting at 2 PM. \n\nNow, let's analyze the inferred sentence \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or it might be cancelled\". This sentence is rephrasing the original sentence, making the \"or\" clause more explicit by adding \"it might\" before \"be cancelled\". This rephrased sentence still conveys the same meaning as the original sentence, which is that there are two possible outcomes: the meeting starts at 2 PM, or it gets cancelled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
