            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence \"The package might be delivered today or tomorrow\" implies that there are two possible outcomes: the package is delivered today or the package is delivered tomorrow. The phrase \"or\" in this context suggests that these two outcomes are mutually exclusive, meaning that if one happens, the other cannot. \n\nThe sentence \"The package might be delivered today or it might be delivered tomorrow\" is a rephrased version of the original sentence. It breaks down the original sentence into two separate clauses, each expressing a possibility. This rephrased sentence still conveys the same meaning as the original sentence, which is that there are two possible outcomes.\n\nSince the rephrased sentence accurately conveys the same meaning as the original sentence, we can infer that the rephrased sentence is a valid interpretation of the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
