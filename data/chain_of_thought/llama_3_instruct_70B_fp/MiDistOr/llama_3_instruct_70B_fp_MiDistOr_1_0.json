            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence \"The envelope might be upstairs or under a bed\" is a disjunction, which means it presents two possible locations where the envelope could be. The phrase \"or\" is used to connect these two possibilities. \n\nIn the inferred sentence \"The envelope might be upstairs or it might be under a bed\", we have a similar disjunction, but with an additional \"it might be\" phrase added to the second disjunct. This additional phrase does not change the meaning of the sentence, as \"might be\" is already implied by the original sentence. \n\nThe inferred sentence is simply a more explicit way of expressing the same idea as the original sentence. Therefore, we can indeed infer the second sentence from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
