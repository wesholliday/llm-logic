The word \"might\" indicates uncertainty or possibility. \n\nWhen we rephrase the statement to \"The flight might be delayed or it might be on time\", we are essentially breaking down the original statement into its two possible outcomes and rephrasing each outcome to include the word \"might\". This rephrased statement still conveys the same uncertainty and possibility as the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
