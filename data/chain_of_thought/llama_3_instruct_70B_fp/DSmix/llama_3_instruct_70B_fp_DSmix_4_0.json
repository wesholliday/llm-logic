In other words, if ~S (not snurgled), then C (crinked).\n\n2. \"The fribble might not be crinked\" - This statement implies that it's possible that the fribble is not crinked, i.e., ~C (not crinked) is possible.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf ~C is possible, and we know that if ~S then C, then it means that ~S is not possible (because if ~S were possible, then C would be true, but we know ~C is possible). Therefore, S (the fribble is snurgled) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
