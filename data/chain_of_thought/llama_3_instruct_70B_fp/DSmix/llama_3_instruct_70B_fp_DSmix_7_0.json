In other words, if ~shanked, then tinked.\n\n2. \"The whiffle might not be tinked\" - This statement implies that there is a possibility that the whiffle is not tinked. In other words, ~tinked is possible.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf ~tinked is possible, and we know that if ~shanked, then tinked, then it means that ~shanked is not possible (because if it were, then tinked would be true, but we know ~tinked is possible). Therefore, the only possibility left is that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
