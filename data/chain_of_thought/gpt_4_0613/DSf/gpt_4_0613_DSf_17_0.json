The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities: the scarf is not draped on the coat rack. Given that these are the only two possibilities presented for the location of the scarf, if one is eliminated, the other must be true. Therefore, if the scarf is not draped on the coat rack, it must be stuffed in the backpack. \n\nAnswer: yes",
