The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities: the sock isn't under the bed. Given that these were the only two options presented in the first statement, and one has been ruled out, we can infer that the sock must be in the remaining location. Therefore, the missing sock is in the laundry basket. \n\nAnswer: yes",
