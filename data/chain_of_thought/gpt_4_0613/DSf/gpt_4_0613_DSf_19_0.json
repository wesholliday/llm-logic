The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities, stating that the watch isn't on his wrist. Given that these are the only two possibilities presented, and one has been eliminated, we can infer that the watch must be in the remaining location. Therefore, the watch must be charging on the dresser. \n\nAnswer: yes",
