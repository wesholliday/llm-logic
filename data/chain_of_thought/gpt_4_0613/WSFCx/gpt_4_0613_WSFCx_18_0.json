This means that it could be one or the other, but not necessarily both at the same time. The proposed inference, however, suggests that the zump might be both a zooble quibble and a blurble. This is not a valid inference based on the original sentence, as the original sentence does not provide information that would allow us to conclude that the zump could be both at the same time.\n\nAnswer: no",
