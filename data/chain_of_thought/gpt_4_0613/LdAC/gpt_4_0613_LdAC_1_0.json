However, it does not tell us that Sue's presence at the wedding guarantees Mary's presence. The second statement, 'Sue was at the wedding', only confirms that Sue was present. It does not provide any information about Mary's presence. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce from these two statements that 'Mary was at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer: no",
