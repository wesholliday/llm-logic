            "content": "The statement 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' is a conditional statement. It means that if the first part (the cake being chocolate) is true, then the second part (the muffins being blueberry) must also be true. However, it does not mean that if the second part is true, then the first part must also be true. This is a common logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. Just because the muffins were blueberry, it does not necessarily mean that the cake was chocolate. There could be other reasons why the muffins were blueberry. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce that 'The cake was chocolate' from these statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
