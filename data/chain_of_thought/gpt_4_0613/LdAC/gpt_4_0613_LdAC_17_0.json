It tells us that if a certain condition (Ben eating pasta) is true, then a certain result (Kate eating salad) is also true. However, it does not tell us that the reverse is true. In other words, it does not tell us that if Kate ate salad, then Ben must have eaten pasta. Therefore, even though we know that 'Kate ate salad', we cannot logically deduce from this information alone that 'Ben ate pasta'. \n\nAnswer: No",
