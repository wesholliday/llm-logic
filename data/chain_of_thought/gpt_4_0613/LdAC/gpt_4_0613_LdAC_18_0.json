            "content": "No, we cannot logically deduce that the doll was plastic from these statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, saying that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. However, this does not mean that the only way the truck could be metal is if the doll was plastic. The truck being metal could be true regardless of the material of the doll. The second statement only confirms that the truck was metal, but it does not provide any information about the doll. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce that the doll was plastic from these statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
