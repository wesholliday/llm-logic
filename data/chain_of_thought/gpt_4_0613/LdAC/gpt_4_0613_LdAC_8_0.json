The first statement is a conditional statement, where the vampire being awake is a sufficient condition for the mummy being awake. However, it does not imply that the vampire being awake is a necessary condition for the mummy being awake. The mummy could be awake for other reasons. The second statement only tells us that the mummy was awake, but it does not provide any information about whether the vampire was awake. Therefore, from these two statements, we cannot logically deduce that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
