The book is a mystery novel.\n\nFrom these statements, we cannot logically deduce that the book was written by James. The first statement tells us that if James wrote the book, then it is a mystery novel. However, it does not tell us that only James writes mystery novels. The second statement tells us that the book is a mystery novel, but it does not tell us who wrote it. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce that the book was written by James based on these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: No",
