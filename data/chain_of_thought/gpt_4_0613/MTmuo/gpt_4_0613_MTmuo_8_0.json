Since we know from the first statement that the mummy was not necessarily awake, we can infer that the condition for the second statement (the vampire being awake) did not occur. If the vampire had been awake, then the mummy would have had to be awake, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that the vampire was not awake. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
