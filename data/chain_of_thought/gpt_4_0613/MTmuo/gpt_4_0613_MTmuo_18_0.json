If we combine these two statements, we can infer that the doll could not have been plastic. This is because if the doll was plastic, then according to the second statement, the truck must have been metal. But the first statement tells us that the truck was not necessarily metal. Therefore, the only way these two statements can both be true is if the doll was not plastic. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
