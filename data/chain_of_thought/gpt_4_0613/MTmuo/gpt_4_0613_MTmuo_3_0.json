The second statement tells us that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. If we combine these two statements, we can infer that since the book is not necessarily a mystery novel, it could not have been written by James, because if it was written by James, it would have to be a mystery novel. Therefore, we can infer that the book was not written by James. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
