If we combine these two statements, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza. This is because if Sue had chosen pizza, then according to the second statement, Bob must have chosen pasta. But the first statement tells us that Bob did not necessarily choose pasta. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
