If we combine these two statements, we can infer that the shirt could not have been cotton. This is because if the shirt was cotton, then according to the second statement, the pants must have been denim. But the first statement tells us that the pants were not necessarily denim. Therefore, the only way these two statements can both be true is if the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
