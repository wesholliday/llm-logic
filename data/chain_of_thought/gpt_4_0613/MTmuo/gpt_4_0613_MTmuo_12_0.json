If we combine these two statements, we can infer that since Lucy did not necessarily go to the zoo, then Joe could not have gone to the park. This is because if Joe had gone to the park, then Lucy would have had to go to the zoo, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
