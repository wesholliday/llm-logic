The second statement tells us that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. If we combine these two statements, we can infer that the bear could not have been in the cave. This is because if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den, which contradicts the first statement that the wolf was not necessarily in the den. Therefore, the bear could not have been in the cave. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
