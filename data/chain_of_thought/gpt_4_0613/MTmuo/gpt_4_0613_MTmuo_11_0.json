The second statement tells us that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry. If we combine these two statements, we can infer that the cake could not have been chocolate. This is because if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would have to be blueberry, which contradicts the first statement that the muffins were not necessarily blueberry. Therefore, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
