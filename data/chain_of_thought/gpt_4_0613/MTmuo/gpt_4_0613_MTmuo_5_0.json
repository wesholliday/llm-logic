If we combine these two statements, we can infer that since Amy did not necessarily play tennis, then Jeff could not have played basketball. This is because if Jeff had played basketball, then Amy would have had to play tennis, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball. \n\nAnswer: yes",
