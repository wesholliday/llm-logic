The second statement tells us that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have also finished the race. If we combine these two statements, we can infer that since Chris did not necessarily finish the race, then Alex could not have finished the race. This is because if Alex had finished the race, then according to the second statement, Chris must have also finished the race, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race. \n\nAnswer: yes",
