She might have, but it's not a requirement.\n\n2. \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\" - This is a conditional statement. If the first part (Tom watched football) is true, then the second part (Jen must have watched basketball) must also be true.\n\nIf we know that \"Jen did not necessarily watch basketball\", then the second part of the conditional statement is not true. Since in a conditional statement, if the first part is true then the second part must also be true, and we know the second part is not true, then the first part (Tom watched football) cannot be true either.\n\nSo, we can infer that Tom did not watch football. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
