The second statement tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark would have had to buy the blue shirt. Since we know from the first statement that Mark did not necessarily buy the blue shirt, we can infer that the condition for the second statement to be true (i.e., Lisa buying the red shirt) did not occur. If it had occurred, then Mark would have had to buy the blue shirt, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. \n\nAnswer: yes",
