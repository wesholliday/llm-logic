If we combine these two statements, we can infer that since Sue was not necessarily at the wedding, then Mary could not have been at the wedding either. This is because if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would have had to be there too, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding. \n\nAnswer: yes",
