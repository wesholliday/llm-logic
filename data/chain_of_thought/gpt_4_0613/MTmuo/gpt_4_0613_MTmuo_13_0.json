If we combine these two statements, we can infer that the car could not have been red. This is because if the car was red, then according to the second statement, the truck would have to be blue. But the first statement tells us that the truck was not necessarily blue. Therefore, the only way these two statements can both be true is if the car was not red. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
