This implies that the floob has two properties: it is 'shimble on flimble' and it is 'wumble quorple zibber'. Therefore, if we are asked whether the floob must be 'wumble quorple zibber', we can infer this from the original statement because it is one of the properties that has been directly stated.\n\nAnswer: yes",
