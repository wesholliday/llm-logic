This implies that the quork is located within two things: the wobble and the zibble wumble. However, it does not necessarily mean that the quork is the same as the zibble wumble. The quork is just located within it. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The quork must be zibble wumble\" based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
