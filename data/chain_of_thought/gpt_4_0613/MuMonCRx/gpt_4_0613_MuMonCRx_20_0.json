This implies that 'snizzle' has two properties: it is 'wozzle' and it is 'zibble quank'. Therefore, if we are asked whether 'The snizzle must be zibble quank', we can infer that from the original statement because 'zibble quank' is one of the properties stated for 'snizzle' in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
