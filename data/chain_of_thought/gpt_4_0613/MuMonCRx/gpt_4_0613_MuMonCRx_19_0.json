This means that for the frazzle to be considered a frazzle, it must have both the properties of 'gribble crunk' and 'zump grazzle'. Therefore, it is correct to infer that 'The frazzle must be zump grazzle' because 'zump grazzle' is one of the necessary conditions mentioned in the original statement for something to be a frazzle.\n\nAnswer: yes",
