This means that there are other possibilities for what Sue could have chosen. Therefore, it is possible that Sue might not have chosen pizza. This is because the original statement does not definitively state that Sue did choose pizza, only that she didn't have to. So, it is possible that she did not choose pizza. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
