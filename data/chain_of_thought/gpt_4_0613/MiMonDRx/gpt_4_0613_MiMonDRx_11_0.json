The second statement says 'The frazzle might be quork or snork'. This means that there is a possibility that the frazzle is either a quork or a snork. Since the original statement already established that there is a possibility that the frazzle is a snork, it is consistent with the second statement. The second statement simply adds another possibility (that the frazzle might be a quork), but it does not contradict the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
