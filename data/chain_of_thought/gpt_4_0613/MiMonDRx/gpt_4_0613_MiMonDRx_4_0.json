The statement 'The fizzle might be shimble or glorp' implies that 'fizzle' could be either 'shimble' or 'glorp'. Since the first statement already establishes the possibility of 'fizzle' being 'glorp', it is consistent with the second statement, even if we don't know whether 'fizzle' could be 'shimble'. The second statement is simply a broader version of the first one, including an additional possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
