The second statement is a logical disjunction, saying the wozzle might be in the quazzle or in the grooble. The second statement is true if at least one of its components is true. Since we know from the original statement that it's possible for the wozzle to be in the grooble, the second statement is also true, regardless of whether or not the wozzle might be in the quazzle.\n\nAnswer: yes",
