The second statement introduces an additional possibility, that 'The wumble might floob the crunk'. However, this additional possibility does not contradict or negate the original statement. The second statement still includes the possibility that 'The wumble might zibber the flimble', which is the original statement. Therefore, the original statement does not contradict the second statement, and we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
