The second statement says 'The quimble might be blurble or quank'. This means there is a possibility that the quimble is either blurble or quank. The second statement includes the possibility of the first statement (that the quimble might be quank), and adds another possibility (that the quimble might be blurble). Therefore, the first statement does not contradict the second statement, and we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
