The second statement includes the possibility of the zibber being on the wump, which is consistent with the original statement. The addition of the zibber possibly being on the floob does not contradict the original statement, it simply adds another possibility. Therefore, the original statement does not rule out the possibility presented in the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
