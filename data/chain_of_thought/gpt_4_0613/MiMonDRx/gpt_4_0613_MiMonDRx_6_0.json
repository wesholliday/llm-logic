The statement 'The blimple might be froodle or wibble' suggests that there is a possibility that the blimple is either froodle or wibble. Since the first statement already establishes the possibility of the blimple being wibble, it is consistent with the second statement, even if we don't know whether the blimple could be froodle. The second statement is simply a broader set of possibilities that includes the possibility presented in the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
