The statement 'The glorp might be plonk or zizz' implies that there is a possibility that 'glorp' could be either 'plonk' or 'zizz'. Since the first statement already establishes the possibility of 'glorp' being 'zizz', it is logically consistent to infer that 'glorp' could be either 'plonk' or 'zizz', even if we don't know anything about 'plonk'. The addition of 'plonk' as an option does not negate the possibility of 'glorp' being 'zizz'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
