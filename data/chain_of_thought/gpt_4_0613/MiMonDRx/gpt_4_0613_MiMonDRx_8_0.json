The second statement is asking if 'The quank might be wozzle or quorple'. This is essentially adding another possibility to the original statement. It does not contradict the original statement, because the original statement did not exclude the possibility of the quank being something other than quorple. Therefore, it is possible to infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
