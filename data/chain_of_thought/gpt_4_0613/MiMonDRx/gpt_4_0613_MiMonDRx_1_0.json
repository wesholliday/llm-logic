The second statement is \"The zibber might wibble a frazzle or be flim a grazzle\". This statement presents two possibilities for the zibber: it might wibble a frazzle or it might be flim a grazzle. The second part of this statement is identical to the original statement, so we can infer that part. However, the first part, \"wibble a frazzle\", is not mentioned in the original statement, so we cannot infer that from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: No",
