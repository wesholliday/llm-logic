The statement 'The snork might be blimple or zump' implies that there is a possibility that the snork is either a blimple or a zump. Since the first statement already establishes the possibility of the snork being a zump, it is consistent with the second statement, even if we don't know whether the snork could be a blimple. The second statement is not contradicting the first one, but rather expanding the possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes",
