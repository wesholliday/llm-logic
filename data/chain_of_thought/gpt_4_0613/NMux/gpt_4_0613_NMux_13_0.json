This could mean that the glip was not slogged, or it could mean that the glip was slogged, but it wasn't a requirement. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that 'The glip might not have been slogged', because the original statement allows for the possibility that the glip was not slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
