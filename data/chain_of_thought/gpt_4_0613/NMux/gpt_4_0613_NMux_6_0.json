This could mean that the grommet was not sploffed, or it could mean that it was sploffed, but it didn't have to be. Therefore, from this statement, we can infer that 'The grommet might not have been sploffed', because the original statement allows for the possibility that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
