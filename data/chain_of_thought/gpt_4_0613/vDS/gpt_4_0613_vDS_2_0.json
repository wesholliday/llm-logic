In a disjunctive syllogism, if we have a statement of the form 'P or Q', and we know that 'not Q' is true, then we can conclude that 'P' is true. \n\nIn this case, 'P' is 'the book is on the shelf' and 'Q' is 'it is resting on the table'. The first premise is 'P or Q', and the second premise is 'not Q'. Therefore, according to the rules of disjunctive syllogism, we can conclude that 'P' is true, or in other words, 'the book is on the shelf'. \n\nSo, this form of argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
