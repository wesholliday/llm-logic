This is a valid form of argument known as disjunctive syllogism. If it's true that either A or B must be the case, and it's also true that B is not the case, then it must logically follow that A is the case. Therefore, if it's true that the missing puzzle piece is either in the box or blending in on the floor, and it's also true that the missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor, then it must logically follow that the missing puzzle piece is in the box. \n\nAnswer: yes",
