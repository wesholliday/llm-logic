            "content": "This form of argument is known as disjunctive syllogism. It's a valid form of argument that states if one of two possibilities is false, then the other must be true. In this case, the two possibilities are 'the missing sock is in the laundry basket' and 'it's under the bed'. The second premise states that the sock isn't under the bed, so if that's true, then the only other possibility presented in the first premise must be true. Therefore, the missing sock must be in the laundry basket. This form of argument is logically valid because if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. \n\nAnswer: yes",
