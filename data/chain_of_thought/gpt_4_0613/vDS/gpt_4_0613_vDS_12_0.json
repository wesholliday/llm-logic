This is a valid form of argument known as disjunctive syllogism. If it's true that either one or the other must be the case, and it's not the one, then it must be the other. Therefore, if it's true that the jacket is either draped over the chair or hanging in the closet, and it's not hanging in the closet, then it must be draped over the chair. \n\nAnswer: yes",
