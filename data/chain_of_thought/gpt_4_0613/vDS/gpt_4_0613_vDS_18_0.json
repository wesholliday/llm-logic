In this case, the first premise presents two possibilities: the notebook is either in the drawer or on the nightstand. The second premise negates one of these possibilities: the notebook is not on the nightstand. Therefore, if the notebook is not on the nightstand, it must be in the drawer. This conclusion follows logically from the premises, so the argument is valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
