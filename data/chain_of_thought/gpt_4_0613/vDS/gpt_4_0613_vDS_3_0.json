Therefore, A. In this case, A is 'the keys are in the drawer' and B is 'they are dangling in the cabinet'. The first premise states 'Either A or B', and the second premise states 'Not B'. Therefore, according to the rules of disjunctive syllogism, the conclusion must be 'A', or 'the keys are in the drawer'. So, this form of argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
