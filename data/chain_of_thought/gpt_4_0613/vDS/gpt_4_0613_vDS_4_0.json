In this case, A is 'the cat is napping on the couch' and B is 'it's playing in the bedroom'. The first premise states that either A or B is true. The second premise states that B is not true. Therefore, according to the rules of disjunctive syllogism, A must be true. So, the conclusion 'The cat is napping on the couch' follows logically from the premises. \n\nAnswer: yes",
