            "content": "The form of this argument is known as disjunctive syllogism. It's a valid form of argument that goes like this: If A or B is true, and B is false, then A must be true. In this case, A is 'Fido is inside' and B is 'Fido is in the garden'. The first premise states that either A or B is true. The second premise states that B is false. Therefore, according to the rules of disjunctive syllogism, A must be true. So, if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true, which makes the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
