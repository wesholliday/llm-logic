In this case, A is 'the phone is in the living room' and B is 'it is ringing in the kitchen'. The first premise states 'Either A or B', and the second premise states 'Not B'. Therefore, according to the rules of a disjunctive syllogism, the conclusion must be 'A', or 'the phone is in the living room'. So, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
