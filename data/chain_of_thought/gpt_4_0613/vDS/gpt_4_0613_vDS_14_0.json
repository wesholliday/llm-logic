A disjunctive syllogism is a valid form of argument that goes like this: If A is true or B is true, and A is not true, then B must be true. In this case, A is 'the milk is on the counter' and B is 'the milk is chilling in the fridge'. The first premise states that either A or B is true. The second premise states that B is not true. Therefore, according to the rules of a disjunctive syllogism, A must be true. So, the conclusion that 'the milk is on the counter' is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
