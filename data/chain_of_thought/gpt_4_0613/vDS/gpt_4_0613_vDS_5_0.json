A disjunctive syllogism is a valid form of argument that goes like this: Either A or B is true. Not A, therefore B. In this case, A is 'the cookies are in the jar' and B is 'they are hidden in the pantry'. The first premise states that either A or B is true. The second premise states that B is not true. Therefore, according to the rules of disjunctive syllogism, A must be true. So, the conclusion 'The cookies are in the jar' follows logically from the premises. \n\nAnswer: yes",
