This means that the zazzle has two conditions to meet: it must be at plimp grooble and it must be in the froodle quibble. If we are only asking if the zazzle must be at plimp grooble, we can infer this from the original statement because it is one of the conditions that was originally stated.\n\nAnswer: yes",
