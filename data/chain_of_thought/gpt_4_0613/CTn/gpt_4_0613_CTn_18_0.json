For example, if we say \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet,\" it does not necessarily mean that \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining,\" because there could be other reasons for the ground to be wet (like a sprinkler). \n\nApplying this to the original statement, just because a plastic doll means the truck is not metal, it does not necessarily mean that a metal truck means the doll is not plastic. There could be other types of dolls (like cloth or wood) that could also be present when the truck is metal. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the converse of the original statement just because the original statement is true. \n\nAnswer: No",
