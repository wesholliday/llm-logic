            "content": "The statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was not blue' implies that the car being red and the truck being blue cannot both be true at the same time. Therefore, if we know that the truck was blue, it must be the case that the car was not red. This is the contrapositive of the original statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we can infer 'If the truck was blue, then the car was not red' from 'If the car was red, then the truck was not blue'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
