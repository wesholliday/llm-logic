This is a conditional statement where the condition is 'Ben ate pasta' and the result is 'Kate did not eat the salad'. \n\nThe question asks if we can infer 'If Kate ate the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta' from the original statement. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nThe contrapositive of a statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. In this case, P is 'Ben ate pasta' and Q is 'Kate did not eat the salad'. So, the contrapositive is 'If Kate ate the salad (not Q), then Ben did not eat pasta (not P)'. \n\nSo, we can infer 'If Kate ate the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta' from the original statement 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate did not eat the salad'. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
