This means that the presence of the griffin in the forest guarantees the absence of the unicorn. \n\nIf we reverse the statement to 'If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest', it means that the presence of the unicorn in the forest guarantees the absence of the griffin. \n\nThe two statements are logically equivalent because they both express the same situation: the griffin and the unicorn cannot be in the forest at the same time. If one is present, the other is guaranteed to be absent. Therefore, if the first statement is true, the second statement must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
