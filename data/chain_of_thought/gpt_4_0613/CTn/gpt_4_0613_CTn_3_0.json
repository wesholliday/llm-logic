This is a conditional statement where the condition is 'the book was written by James' and the result is 'the book is not a mystery novel'. \n\nIf we reverse the condition and the result, we get 'If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James'. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nSo, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer 'If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James' from 'If the book was written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
