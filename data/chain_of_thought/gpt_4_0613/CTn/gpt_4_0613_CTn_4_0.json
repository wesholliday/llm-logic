The question asks if we can infer 'If B, then not A' from this statement. This is known as the contrapositive in logic. The contrapositive of a statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A', and it is always logically equivalent to the original statement. In this case, 'If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars' is the contrapositive of the original statement, so we can infer it from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
