            "content": "The original statement is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim'. This is a conditional statement where the shirt being cotton is the condition that leads to the pants not being denim. \n\nIf we reverse this statement, we get 'If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton'. This is also a conditional statement where the pants being denim is the condition that leads to the shirt not being cotton. \n\nIn logic, this is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. \n\nSo, we can infer 'If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton' from 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim'. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
