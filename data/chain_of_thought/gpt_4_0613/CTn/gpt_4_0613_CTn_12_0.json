This means that Joe's going to the park is a sufficient condition for Lucy not going to the zoo. \n\nThe question asks if we can infer the converse: \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\". This would mean that Lucy's going to the zoo is a sufficient condition for Joe not going to the park. \n\nIn logic, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true. For example, if we say \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\", it doesn't mean that \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining\" is true, because there could be other reasons for the ground to be wet (like someone watering the lawn). \n\nApplying this to the given statement, just because Joe's going to the park means Lucy didn't go to the zoo, it doesn't necessarily mean that if Lucy went to the zoo, Joe didn't go to the park. There could be other reasons why Lucy didn't go to the zoo when Joe went to the park.\n\nAnswer: No",
