If we reverse this statement, we get 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding'. This is also a conditional statement where the presence of Sue implies the absence of Mary. This is logically consistent with the original statement because in both cases, it is implied that Mary and Sue cannot both be at the wedding at the same time. Therefore, we can infer the reversed statement from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes",
