This is a conditional statement where the presence of the bear in the cave implies the absence of the wolf in the den. \n\nIf we reverse this statement, we get 'If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave'. This is also a conditional statement where the presence of the wolf in the den implies the absence of the bear in the cave. \n\nThe reversed statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This is because in both cases, the presence of one animal implies the absence of the other. Therefore, we can infer the reversed statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
