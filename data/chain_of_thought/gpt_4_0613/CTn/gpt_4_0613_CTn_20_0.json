This is a conditional statement where the condition is 'the apple was red' and the result is 'the banana was not yellow'. \n\nIf we reverse the condition and the result, we get 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red'. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement always has the same truth value as the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. \n\nSo, based on the original statement, we can infer that 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red'. \n\nAnswer: yes",
