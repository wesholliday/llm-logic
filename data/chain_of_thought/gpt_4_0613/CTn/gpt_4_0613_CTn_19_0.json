            "content": "The original statement is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball'. This is a conditional statement where Tom watching football is the condition that leads to the result of Jen not watching basketball. \n\nIf we reverse this statement to 'If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football', we are essentially saying that Jen watching basketball is the condition that leads to the result of Tom not watching football. \n\nThis is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. \n\nSo, we can infer 'If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football' from 'If Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball'. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
