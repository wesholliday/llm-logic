            "content": "The original statement is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis'. This is a conditional statement where Jeff playing basketball is the condition that leads to Amy not playing tennis. \n\nIf we reverse this statement to 'If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball', we are essentially saying that Amy playing tennis is the condition that leads to Jeff not playing basketball. \n\nThis is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we can infer 'If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball' from 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
