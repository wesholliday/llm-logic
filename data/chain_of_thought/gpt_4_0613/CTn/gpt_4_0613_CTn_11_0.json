This is a conditional statement where the condition is 'the cake was chocolate' and the result is 'the muffins were not blueberry'. \n\nIf we reverse this statement, we get 'If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate'. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nSo, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer 'If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate' from 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
