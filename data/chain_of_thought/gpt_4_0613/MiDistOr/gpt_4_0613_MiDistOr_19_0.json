            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence states that the application might be completed online or in person. This implies that there are two possible ways to complete the application: online or in person. The rephrased sentence, \"The application might be completed online or it might be completed in person\", is essentially saying the same thing. It is just expressing the two possibilities in a slightly different way. Therefore, we can infer the rephrased sentence from the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
