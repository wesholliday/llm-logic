This implies that there are two possible ways to take the medicine: one is with food and the other is without food (on an empty stomach). Therefore, the sentence 'The medicine might be taken with food or it might be taken on an empty stomach' is a rephrasing of the original sentence, maintaining the same meaning.\n\nAnswer: yes",
