            "content": "Explanation: The original statement, \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or be cancelled\", presents two possibilities for the meeting: it might start at 2 PM, or it might be cancelled. The proposed inference, \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or it might be cancelled\", also presents the same two possibilities. The only difference between the two statements is the addition of \"it might\" before \"be cancelled\" in the second statement, which does not change the meaning. Therefore, the inference accurately represents the information given in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
