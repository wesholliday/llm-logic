            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence states that the room might be cleaned daily or upon request. This means that there are two possible scenarios for the room to be cleaned: either it is cleaned daily, or it is cleaned when someone requests it. The rephrased sentence, \"The room might be cleaned daily or it might be cleaned upon request\", conveys the same two scenarios, just with slightly different wording. Therefore, we can infer the rephrased sentence from the original sentence because they both express the same possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes",
