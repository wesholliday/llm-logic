This means that there are two possibilities: the restaurant could be closed, or it could be open but only for a limited time. The rephrased statement says essentially the same thing, just with slightly different wording. It still presents the same two possibilities: the restaurant might be closed on Mondays, or it might be open for limited hours. Therefore, we can infer the rephrased statement from the original one because they both convey the same information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
