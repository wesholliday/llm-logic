This means that there are two possibilities for the delivery of the package: it could either be delivered today or it could be delivered tomorrow. The second statement is simply a rephrasing of the first, breaking down the two possibilities into separate clauses but still maintaining the same meaning. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
