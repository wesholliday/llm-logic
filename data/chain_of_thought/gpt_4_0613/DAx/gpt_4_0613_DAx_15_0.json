However, the second statement 'The dreb was not vroombed' tells us that the condition for the dreb being spened did not occur. This does not necessarily mean that the dreb was not spened. The dreb could have been spened through some other condition not mentioned in the statements. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The dreb was not spened' from these two statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
