It tells us that if a certain condition (the smonk being vreebled) is met, then a certain outcome (the smonk plagging) will occur. However, it does not tell us what will happen if the condition is not met. In other words, if the smonk was not vreebled, we cannot definitively say whether or not the smonk plagged. The smonk could have plagged for a different reason, or it could have not plagged at all. We simply do not have enough information to make this determination. \n\nAnswer: No",
