However, the second statement 'The flugel was not blimmed' only tells us that the condition for zargling did not occur. It does not provide any information about whether the flugel was zargled under some other condition or not. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The flugel was not zargled' from these two statements. \n\nAnswer: No",
