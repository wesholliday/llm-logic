It tells us what happens if a certain condition is met - in this case, if the fleeg was bluttered. However, it does not tell us what happens if the condition is not met. In other words, we don't know what happens if the fleeg was not bluttered. It might still surn, or it might not. Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer that 'The fleeg did not surn'. \n\nAnswer: no",
