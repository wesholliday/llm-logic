It tells us what happens if the whiffle was shanked, but it doesn't tell us what happens if the whiffle was not shanked. The second statement 'The whiffle was not shanked' tells us that the condition for the whiffle to tink did not occur. However, we don't know from the information given whether the whiffle tinked or not when it was not shanked. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The whiffle did not tink' from these two statements.",
