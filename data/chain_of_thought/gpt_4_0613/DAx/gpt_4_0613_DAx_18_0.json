The first statement is a conditional statement, where the occurrence of the second event (the shank was nugged) is dependent on the first event (the shank was plooked). The second statement tells us that the first event did not occur. However, this does not provide any information about whether the second event occurred or not. The second event could still occur independently of the first event. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The shank was not nugged' from these statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
