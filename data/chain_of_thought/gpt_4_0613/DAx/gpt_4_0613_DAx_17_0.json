This is a conditional statement where the first part (the flob was skizzled) is the condition and the second part (the flob movated) is the result. \n\nThe second statement tells us that the condition did not occur. However, this does not necessarily mean that the result did not occur. The result could still occur due to some other condition not mentioned in the given statements. \n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer that 'The flob was not movated'. \n\nAnswer: No",
