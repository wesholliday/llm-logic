The second statement tells us that the first condition (the smip being shripped) did not happen. However, this does not necessarily mean that the second condition (the smip lupping the zoint) also did not happen. The second condition could still occur independently of the first. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The smip did not lup the zoint' based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: No",
