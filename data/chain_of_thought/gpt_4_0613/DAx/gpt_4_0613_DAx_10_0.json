            "content": "The statement 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled' is a conditional statement. It tells us that if a certain condition (the wug being sproinged) is met, then a certain outcome (the wug being garpled) will follow. However, it does not tell us what happens if the condition is not met. In other words, it does not tell us whether or not the wug would be garpled if it was not sproinged. Therefore, from the statement 'The wug was not sproinged', we cannot infer 'The wug was not garpled'. The wug could still be garpled even if it was not sproinged, because the original statement does not exclude this possibility.\n\nAnswer: No",
