The second statement tells us that the grommet was not sploffed. However, these two statements do not provide enough information to infer whether or not the grommet plopped the frink. The first statement only tells us what happens if the grommet was sploffed, but it does not tell us what happens if the grommet was not sploffed. Therefore, we cannot infer that the grommet did not plop the frink just because it was not sploffed.\n\nAnswer: no",
