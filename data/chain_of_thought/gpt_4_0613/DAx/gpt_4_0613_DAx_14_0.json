It tells us that if a certain condition (the clug being fleeked) is met, then a certain outcome (the clug snugging) will occur. \n\nThe second statement, 'The clug was not fleeked', tells us that the condition for the first statement was not met. \n\nHowever, these two statements together do not allow us to infer 'The clug was not snugged'. This is because the first statement only tells us what happens if the clug is fleeked, not what happens if the clug is not fleeked. It's possible that the clug could snug even if it wasn't fleeked. \n\nSo, based on the information given, we cannot definitively say whether the clug snugged or not when it was not fleeked. \n\nAnswer: No",
