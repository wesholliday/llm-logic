However, we are given the information that 'The sneg was not crampled'. This means that the condition for the sneg to sprot the frink did not occur. However, this does not necessarily mean that the sneg did not sprot the frink. There could be other conditions or reasons for the sneg to sprot the frink that we are not aware of. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The sneg did not sprot the frink' from the given statements. \n\nAnswer: No",
