It tells us that if a certain condition (the wug being flooped) is true, then a certain result (the wug bimming the zoint) is also true. However, it does not tell us what happens if the condition is not true. \n\nThe second statement 'The wug was not flooped' tells us that the condition in the first statement is not true. However, because the first statement does not tell us what happens if the condition is not true, we cannot infer anything about whether or not the wug bimmed the zoint. \n\nTherefore, from these two statements, we cannot infer 'The wug did not bim the zoint'. \n\nAnswer: No",
