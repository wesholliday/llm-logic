The second statement tells us that the zinger was not fraggled. However, these two statements do not provide any information about what happens when the zinger is not fraggled. It could still be smoogled or not smoogled. Therefore, we cannot infer that the zinger was not smoogled based on these two statements. \n\nAnswer: no",
