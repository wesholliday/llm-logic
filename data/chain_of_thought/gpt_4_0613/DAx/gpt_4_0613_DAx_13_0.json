It tells us that if a certain condition (the glip being slogged) is true, then another condition (the glip being tragged) is also true. However, it does not tell us what happens if the first condition is not true. \n\nThe second statement 'The glip was not slogged' tells us that the first condition of the conditional statement is not true. \n\nHowever, we cannot infer from these two statements that 'The glip was not tragged'. The conditional statement does not tell us what happens if the glip was not slogged. It is possible that the glip was tragged for some other reason, or it is possible that the glip was not tragged. We simply do not have enough information to make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
