However, it does not tell us what happens if the fribble was not snurgled. Therefore, from the statement 'The fribble was not snurgled', we cannot infer anything about whether the fribble crinked or not. The fribble could have crinked for some other reason, or it could have not crinked at all. We simply do not have enough information to make an inference. \n\nAnswer: No",
