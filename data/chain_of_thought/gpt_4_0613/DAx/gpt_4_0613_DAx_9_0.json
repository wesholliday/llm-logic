The second statement tells us that the condition was not met - the twonk was not plinked. However, this does not necessarily mean that the result did not occur. The twonk could have been varnished for some other reason, not related to it being plinked. Therefore, we cannot infer that the twonk was not varnished just because it was not plinked. \n\nAnswer: No",
