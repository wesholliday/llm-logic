The first statement is a conditional statement, where the quanking of the splat is dependent on the splat being morphed. The second statement tells us that the splat was not morphed. However, we do not have any information about what happens when the splat is not morphed. It could still quank or not quank. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The splat did not quank' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
