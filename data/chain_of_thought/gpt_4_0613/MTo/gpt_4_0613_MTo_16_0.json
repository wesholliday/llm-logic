However, since we know from the first statement that the pants were not denim, it follows that the shirt could not have been cotton. This is because if the shirt was cotton, then the pants would have to be denim, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton. \n\nAnswer: yes",
