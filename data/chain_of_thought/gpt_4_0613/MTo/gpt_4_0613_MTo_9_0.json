However, we know from the first statement that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. Therefore, if the second statement is true, then Lisa could not have bought the red shirt, because if she had, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. \n\nAnswer: yes",
