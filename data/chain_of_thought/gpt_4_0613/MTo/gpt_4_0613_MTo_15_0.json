In other words, if Sam took a plane, Erin must have taken a train. However, we know from the first statement that 'Erin did not take a train'. Therefore, given that Erin did not take a train, it must be the case that Sam did not take a plane, because if he had, Erin would have taken a train, which contradicts the information we have. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
