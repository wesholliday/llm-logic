However, we know from the first statement that the banana was not yellow. Therefore, the condition for the apple being red (which is the banana being yellow) was not met. This means that the apple could not have been red, because if it were, then the banana would have been yellow, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that the apple was not red. \n\nAnswer: yes",
