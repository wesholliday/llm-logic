The second statement tells us that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest. However, we know from the first statement that the unicorn was not in the forest. Therefore, the condition for the griffin being in the forest (i.e., the unicorn being in the forest) is not met. This means that the griffin could not have been in the forest, because if it were, then the unicorn would also have to be in the forest, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
