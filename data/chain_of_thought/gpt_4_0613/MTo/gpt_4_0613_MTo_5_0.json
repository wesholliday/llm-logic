In other words, if Jeff played basketball, Amy must have played tennis. However, we know from the first statement that 'Amy did not play tennis'. Therefore, given that Amy did not play tennis, it must be the case that Jeff did not play basketball, because if he had, Amy would have played tennis, which contradicts the information we have. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
