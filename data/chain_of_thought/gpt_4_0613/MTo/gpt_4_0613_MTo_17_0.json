Since we know from the first statement that Kate did not eat the salad, we can infer that the condition for the second statement (Ben eating pasta) did not occur. If it had, then Kate would have eaten the salad, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta. \n\nAnswer: yes",
