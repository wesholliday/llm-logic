            "content": "The first statement tells us that the wolf was not in the den. The second statement is a conditional statement that says if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. Since we know from the first statement that the wolf was not in the den, we can infer that the condition for the second statement to be true was not met. In other words, the bear could not have been in the cave, because if it were, then the wolf would have been in the den, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave. \n\nAnswer: yes",
