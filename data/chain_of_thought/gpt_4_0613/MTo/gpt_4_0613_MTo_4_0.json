The second statement is a conditional statement that tells us if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. \n\nIf we assume that the alien did visit Mars, then according to the second statement, the robot should have visited Jupiter. But this contradicts the first statement which says that the robot did not visit Jupiter. \n\nTherefore, to avoid this contradiction, we must infer that the alien did not visit Mars. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
