However, we know from the first statement that the truck was not metal. Therefore, the condition for the doll being plastic (i.e., the truck being metal) was not met. In logic, this is known as modus tollens, a valid form of argument where if the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false. Therefore, we can infer that the doll was not plastic. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
