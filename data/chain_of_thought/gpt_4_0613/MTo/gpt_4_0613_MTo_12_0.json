Since we know from the first statement that Lucy did not go to the zoo, we can infer that the condition for the second statement (Joe going to the park) did not occur. This is because if Joe had gone to the park, then according to the second statement, Lucy would have gone to the zoo, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
