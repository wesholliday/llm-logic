            "content": "The statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement. It means that if the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true. However, it does not mean that if the second part is true, then the first part must also be true. This is a common logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. Just because Mark bought the blue shirt, we cannot automatically conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt. There could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt that have nothing to do with Lisa's actions. \n\nAnswer: No",
