The first statement is a conditional statement, where the occurrence of the second event (Chris finishing the race) is dependent on the first event (Alex finishing the race). However, the occurrence of the first event (Alex finishing the race) is not necessarily dependent on the second event. \n\nIn other words, the statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' does not mean 'If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race'. Therefore, even though we know that 'Chris finished the race', we cannot definitively conclude that 'Alex finished the race'. \n\nAnswer: no",
