            "content": "The statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement. It tells us that if a certain condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then another condition (Sue being at the wedding) is also true. However, it does not tell us that if the second condition (Sue being at the wedding) is true, then the first condition (Mary being at the wedding) must also be true. This is a common logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. Therefore, even though we know that Sue was at the wedding, we cannot conclude that Mary was at the wedding based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
