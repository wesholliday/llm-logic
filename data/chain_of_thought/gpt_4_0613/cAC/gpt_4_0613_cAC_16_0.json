The first statement is a conditional statement, where the shirt being cotton is a sufficient condition for the pants being denim. However, it does not mean that the pants being denim is a sufficient condition for the shirt being cotton. The pants could be denim for other reasons not related to the shirt's material. Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The shirt was cotton'.\n\nAnswer: no",
