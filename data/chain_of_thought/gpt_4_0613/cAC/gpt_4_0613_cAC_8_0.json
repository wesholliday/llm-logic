The first statement is a conditional statement, where the vampire being awake is a sufficient condition for the mummy being awake. However, it does not mean that the mummy being awake is a sufficient condition for the vampire being awake. The mummy could be awake for other reasons not related to the vampire's state. Therefore, from these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
