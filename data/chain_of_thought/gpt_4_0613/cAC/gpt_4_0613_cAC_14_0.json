The first statement is a conditional statement, where the presence of the bear in the cave implies the presence of the wolf in the den. However, the presence of the wolf in the den does not necessarily imply the presence of the bear in the cave. The wolf could be in the den for other reasons. Therefore, from these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The bear was in the cave'.\n\nAnswer: no",
