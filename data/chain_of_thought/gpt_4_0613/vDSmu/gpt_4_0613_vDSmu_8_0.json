This is a valid form of argument known as disjunctive syllogism. If it's true that either A or B must be the case, and it's also true that B is not the case, then it must be true that A is the case. In this specific argument, if it's true that the remote is either on the table or under the couch, and it's also true that the remote is not under the couch, then it must be true that the remote is on the table. Therefore, this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
