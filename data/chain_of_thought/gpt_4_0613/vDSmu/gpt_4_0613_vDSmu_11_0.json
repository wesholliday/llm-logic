Therefore, B. \n\nIn this case, A is 'the newspaper is in the driveway' and B is 'the newspaper must be sitting on the porch'. The first premise states 'Either A or B'. The second premise states 'Not B'. Therefore, according to the rules of disjunctive syllogism, the conclusion must be 'A', or 'the newspaper is in the driveway'. \n\nSo, this form of argument is indeed logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
