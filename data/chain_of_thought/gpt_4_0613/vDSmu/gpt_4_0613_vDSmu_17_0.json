Therefore, A. \n\nIn this case, A is 'the scarf is stuffed in my backpack' and B is 'the scarf must be draped on the coat rack'. The first premise states 'Either A or B'. The second premise states 'Not B'. Therefore, according to the rules of disjunctive syllogism, the conclusion must be 'A', or 'the scarf is stuffed in my backpack'. \n\nSo, this form of argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
