Therefore, A. \n\nIn this case, A is 'the milk is on the counter' and B is 'the milk must be chilling in the fridge'. The first premise states 'Either A or B', and the second premise states 'Not B'. Therefore, according to the rules of disjunctive syllogism, the conclusion must be 'A', or 'the milk is on the counter'. \n\nSo, this form of argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
