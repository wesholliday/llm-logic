This is a valid form of argument known as disjunctive syllogism. In this case, P is 'Fido is inside' and Q is 'Fido must be in the garden'. The first premise states that either P or Q must be true. The second premise states that Q is not true. Therefore, P must be true. So, the conclusion 'Fido is inside' logically follows from the premises. \n\nAnswer: yes",
