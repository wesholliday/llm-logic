Therefore, B. In this case, A is 'the missing puzzle piece is in the box' and B is 'it must be blending in on the floor'. The argument states either A or B, and then states not B. Therefore, according to the rules of disjunctive syllogism, the conclusion must be A, 'the missing puzzle piece is in the box'. So, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
