Therefore, B. In this case, A is 'the umbrella is in the car' and B is 'it must be tucked away in the closet'. The first premise presents A or B. The second premise negates B. Therefore, according to the rules of disjunctive syllogism, the conclusion must be A, which is 'the umbrella is in the car'. So, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
