A disjunctive syllogism is a valid form of argument that goes like this: If A is true or B is true, and A is not true, then B must be true. \n\nIn this case, A is 'the pen is in my bag' and B is 'the pen must be on my desk'. The first premise states that either A or B is true. The second premise states that B is not true. Therefore, according to the rules of disjunctive syllogism, A must be true. \n\nSo, the conclusion 'The pen is in my bag' follows logically from the premises. \n\nAnswer: yes",
