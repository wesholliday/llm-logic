This is a valid form of argument known as disjunctive syllogism. If it's true that either A or B must be the case, and it's also true that B is not the case, then it must logically follow that A is the case. In this specific argument, if it's true that the cat is either napping on the couch or playing in the bedroom, and it's also true that the cat is not playing in the bedroom, then it must logically follow that the cat is napping on the couch. \n\nAnswer: yes",
