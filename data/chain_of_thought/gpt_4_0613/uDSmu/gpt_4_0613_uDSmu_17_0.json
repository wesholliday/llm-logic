It is also stated that it is not the case that the scarf is on the coat rack. This means that the possibility of the scarf being on the coat rack is eliminated. Given that these are the only two possibilities presented for the location of the scarf, and one has been eliminated, we can infer that the scarf must be in the other location, which is the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
