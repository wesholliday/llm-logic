It's also stated that it's not the case that the sock must be under the bed. This means that the possibility of the sock being under the bed is ruled out. Given these conditions, the only remaining possibility for the location of the sock is the laundry basket. Therefore, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket. \n\nAnswer: yes",
