The second statement is a conditional statement, where being 'plinked' is a sufficient condition for being 'varnished'. However, the fact that the twonk was varnished does not necessarily mean it was plinked. It could have been varnished without being plinked. The statements do not provide a necessary condition that the twonk must be plinked to be varnished. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The twonk was plinked' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
