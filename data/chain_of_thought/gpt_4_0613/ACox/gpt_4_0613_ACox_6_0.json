If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, where the condition is \"the grommet was sploffed\" and the result is \"the grommet plopped the frink\". \n\nThe first statement confirms that the result \"the grommet plopped the frink\" is true. However, this does not necessarily mean that the condition \"the grommet was sploffed\" is true. \n\nIn logic, this is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. Just because the result of a condition is true, it does not mean that the condition itself is true. There could be other reasons why \"the grommet plopped the frink\" that are not included in the given statements.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The grommet was sploffed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
