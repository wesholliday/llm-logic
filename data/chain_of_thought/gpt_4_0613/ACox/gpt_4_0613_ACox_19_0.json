The second statement is a conditional statement, where being 'plinked' is a sufficient condition for being 'varnished'. However, being 'varnished' does not necessarily mean the twonk was 'plinked'. It could have been varnished without being plinked. Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer that 'The twonk was plinked'.\n\nAnswer: no",
