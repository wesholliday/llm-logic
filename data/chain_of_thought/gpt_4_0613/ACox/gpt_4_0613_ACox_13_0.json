The second statement is a conditional statement, where the occurrence of the splat being quanked is dependent on the splat being morphed. However, the first statement only tells us that the splat was quanked, but it does not provide any information about whether the splat was morphed. Therefore, we cannot infer from these two statements that 'The splat was morphed'. \n\nAnswer: no",
