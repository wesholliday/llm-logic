The second statement is a conditional statement, where 'the fribble was snurgled' is the condition for 'the fribble crinked'. However, the fact that 'the fribble crinked' does not necessarily mean that 'the fribble was snurgled'. The crinking could have been caused by something else. This is a common logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent, where one incorrectly assumes that if the outcome of a condition is true, then the condition must also be true. \n\nAnswer: No",
