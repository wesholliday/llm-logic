The second statement is a conditional statement, where the cranking of the sprocket leads to the sprocket being daggled. However, the fact that the sprocket was daggled does not necessarily mean that the sprocket was cranked. There could be other reasons or actions that led to the sprocket being daggled. This is a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent, where the truth of the consequent (the sprocket was daggled) is incorrectly assumed to guarantee the truth of the antecedent (the sprocket was cranked). \n\nAnswer: No",
