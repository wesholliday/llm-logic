The second statement is a conditional statement, where 'the flug was blummed' is the condition for 'the flug was zimmed'. However, knowing that 'the flug was zimmed' does not necessarily mean that 'the flug was blummed'. The flug being zimmed could be the result of another condition not mentioned in the information given. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The flug was blummed' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
