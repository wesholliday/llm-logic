The second statement is a conditional statement, where 'the splat was morphed' is the condition for 'the splat quanked'. However, the fact that 'the splat quanked' does not necessarily mean that 'the splat was morphed'. This is because the conditional statement does not specify that 'the splat quanked' can only happen if 'the splat was morphed'. There could be other conditions that could lead to 'the splat quanked'. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The splat was morphed' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
