The second statement is a conditional statement, where 'the fribble was snurgled' is the condition for 'the fribble was crinked'. However, the fact that 'the fribble was crinked' does not necessarily mean that 'the fribble was snurgled'. The crinking of the fribble could have been caused by something else. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The fribble was snurgled' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
