The second statement is a conditional statement, where 'the wug was sproinged' is the condition for 'it was garpled'. However, the fact that 'the wug was garpled' does not necessarily mean that 'the wug was sproinged'. It could have been garpled due to some other reason. The conditional statement only tells us that if it was sproinged, then it was definitely garpled, but not the other way around. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The wug was sproinged' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
