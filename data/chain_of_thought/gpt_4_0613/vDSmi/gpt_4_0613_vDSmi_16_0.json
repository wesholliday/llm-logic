The second premise only suggests that it might not be on the desk, but it doesn't confirm that it isn't. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the pen is in the bag. The pen could be somewhere else entirely, or it could still be on the desk because the second premise only suggests a possibility, not a certainty. Therefore, the conclusion is not necessarily true based on the premises given. \n\nAnswer: No",
