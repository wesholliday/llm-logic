The second premise only suggests that the cat might not be playing in the bedroom, but it doesn't confirm it. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the cat is napping on the couch. The cat could be somewhere else entirely, or it could still be playing in the bedroom because the second premise only suggests a possibility, not a certainty. \n\nAnswer: No",
