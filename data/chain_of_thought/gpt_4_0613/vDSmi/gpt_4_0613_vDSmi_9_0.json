The first premise presents two possibilities for the location of the missing puzzle piece: it's either in the box or on the floor. The second premise then eliminates one of these possibilities: it might not be on the floor. If we accept that the puzzle piece must be in one of these two places, and it might not be on the floor, then it must be in the box. Therefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
