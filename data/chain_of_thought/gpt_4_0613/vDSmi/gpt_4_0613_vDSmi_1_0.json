The second premise states that Fido might not be in the garden. However, this does not necessarily mean that Fido is inside. The word \"might\" introduces a possibility, not a certainty. Therefore, even if Fido might not be in the garden, it doesn't necessarily mean that Fido is inside. The conclusion is not guaranteed by the premises, so the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
