The second premise only suggests that the book might not be on the table, but it doesn't confirm that the book is definitely not on the table. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the book is on the shelf. The book could still possibly be on the table or it could be somewhere else entirely. The conclusion is not guaranteed by the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
