The second premise only suggests that it might not be on the nightstand, but it doesn't confirm that it's not there. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the notebook is in the drawer. The argument would be valid if the second premise definitively stated that the notebook is not on the nightstand. As it stands, the conclusion is not guaranteed by the premises. \n\nAnswer: No",
