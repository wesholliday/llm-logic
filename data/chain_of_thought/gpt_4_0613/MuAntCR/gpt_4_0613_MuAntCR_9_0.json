It does not provide any information about the flight being delayed. A reroute could occur for many reasons, such as weather or airspace congestion, and while these could potentially cause a delay, it's not a guaranteed outcome. Therefore, we cannot infer that the flight was delayed based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: No",
