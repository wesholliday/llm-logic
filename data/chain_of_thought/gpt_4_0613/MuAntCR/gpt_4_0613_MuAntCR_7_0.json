The difficulty of an exam is not solely determined by the amount of content it covers. It could also depend on the complexity of the questions, the time allowed for the exam, the level of preparation of the students, among other factors. Therefore, we cannot infer that the exam was difficult just because it covered all chapters.\n\nAnswer: no",
