In this case, P is 'the shirt was cotton' and Q is 'the pants were denim'. The argument states: If the shirt was cotton (P), then the pants were denim (Q). The pants were not denim (not Q). Therefore, the shirt was not cotton (not P). This is a valid form of argument in logic. Therefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
