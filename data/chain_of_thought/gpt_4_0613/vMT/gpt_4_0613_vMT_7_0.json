            "content": "The form of argument being used here is called Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens is a valid form of argument. It works like this: If P then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P. In this case, P is 'Alex finished the race' and Q is 'Chris finished the race'. The argument states that if P then Q, and it also states that not Q. Therefore, according to Modus Tollens, it must be the case that not P. So, if it's true that if Alex finished the race then Chris finished the race, and it's also true that Chris did not finish the race, then it must be true that Alex did not finish the race. Therefore, this form of argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
