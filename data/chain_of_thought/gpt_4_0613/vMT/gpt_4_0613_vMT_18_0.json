In this case, P is 'the doll was plastic' and Q is 'the truck was metal'. The argument states: If the doll was plastic (P), then the truck was metal (Q). The truck was not metal (not Q). Therefore, the doll was not plastic (not P). This is a valid form of argument in logic. Therefore, the argument 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal', 'The truck was not metal', 'The doll was not plastic' is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
