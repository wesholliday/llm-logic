In this case, P is 'the bear was in the cave' and Q is 'the wolf was in the den'. The argument states: If the bear was in the cave (P), then the wolf was in the den (Q). The wolf was not in the den (not Q). Therefore, the bear was not in the cave (not P). This is a valid form of argument in logic. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
