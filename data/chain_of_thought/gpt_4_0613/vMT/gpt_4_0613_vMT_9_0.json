Therefore, not P. \n\nIn this case, P is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and Q is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. The argument states that if P then Q, and it is given that not Q (Mark did not buy the blue shirt). Therefore, according to Modus Tollens, it should follow that not P (Lisa did not buy the red shirt). \n\nSo, this form of argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
