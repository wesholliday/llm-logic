            "content": "The form of argument being used here is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens works like this: If P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must also be false. In this case, P is 'the griffin was in the forest' and Q is 'the unicorn was in the forest'. The argument states that if P is true, then Q is true. It then states that Q is false. Therefore, according to modus tollens, P must also be false. So, the conclusion that 'the griffin was not in the forest' is logically valid based on the given premises.",
