            "content": "The form of argument in question is known as Modus Tollens in logic. Modus Tollens is a valid form of argument. It works like this: If P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must also be false. In this case, P is 'Mary was at the wedding' and Q is 'Sue was at the wedding'. The first premise states that if P then Q. The second premise states that Q is false. Therefore, according to Modus Tollens, P must also be false. So, the conclusion that 'Mary was not at the wedding' is logically valid based on the given premises. \n\nAnswer: yes",
