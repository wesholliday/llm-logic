Not Q. Therefore, not P. In this case, P is 'Sam took a plane' and Q is 'Erin took a train'. The first premise states 'If P, then Q', the second premise states 'Not Q', and the conclusion is 'Not P'. Therefore, the argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument. \n\nAnswer: yes",
