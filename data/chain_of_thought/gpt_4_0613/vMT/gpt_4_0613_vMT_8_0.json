            "content": "The form of argument being used here is called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument. It works like this: if we know that if P then Q, and we know that not-Q, then we can conclude not-P. In this case, P is 'the vampire was awake' and Q is 'the mummy was awake'. The first premise tells us 'if P then Q'. The second premise tells us 'not-Q'. Therefore, we can conclude 'not-P', or 'the vampire was not awake'. This matches the conclusion given in the argument, so the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
