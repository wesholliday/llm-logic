            "content": "The form of argument being used here is called modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens works like this: if we have a conditional statement (if P then Q), and we know that Q is false, then we can conclude that P is also false. In this case, P is 'the book was written by James' and Q is 'the book is a mystery novel'. The argument tells us that if P is true, then Q is true (first premise), and that Q is false (second premise). Therefore, according to modus tollens, P must also be false. So, the conclusion that 'the book was not written by James' is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
