            "content": "The form of argument in question is known as Modus Tollens in logic. The structure of Modus Tollens is as follows: If P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P. \n\nIn this case, P is 'Ben ate pasta' and Q is 'Kate ate salad'. The first premise is 'If P, then Q', the second premise is 'Not Q', and the conclusion is 'Not P'. \n\nThis form of argument is valid because if the first two premises are true (If P, then Q and Not Q), then the conclusion (Not P) must also be true. Therefore, if it's true that 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad' and it's also true that 'Kate did not eat salad', then it must be true that 'Ben did not eat pasta'. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
