            "content": "The given statement is 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink'. This is a conditional statement where 'the sneg was crampled' is the condition and 'the sneg sproted the frink' is the result. \n\nThe question asks if we can infer 'If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled' from the given statement. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nThe contrapositive is formed by negating both the condition and the result of the original statement and reversing their order. So, 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink' becomes 'If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled'. \n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled' from 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
