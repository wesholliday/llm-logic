In this case, P is \"the grommet was sploffed\" and Q is \"the grommet plopped the frink\". \n\nThe question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is \"If not Q, then not P\". In this case, not Q is \"the grommet did not plop the frink\" and not P is \"the grommet was not sploffed\". \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. \n\nSo, based on the original statement, we can infer the contrapositive statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
