            "content": "The original statement is 'If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled'. This is a conditional statement, where 'the flugel was blimmed' is the condition and 'the flugel was zargled' is the result. \n\nThe question asks if we can infer 'If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed' from the original statement. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nThe contrapositive is formed by negating both the condition and the result of the original statement and reversing their order. So, the contrapositive of 'If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled' is 'If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed'. \n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed' from 'If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
