            "content": "The original statement is 'If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked'. This is a conditional statement, where 'the whiffle was shanked' is the condition and 'the whiffle tinked' is the result. \n\nThe question asks if we can infer 'If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked' from the original statement. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nThe contrapositive is formed by negating both the condition and the result of the original statement and reversing their order. So, 'If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked' becomes 'If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked'. \n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked' from 'If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
