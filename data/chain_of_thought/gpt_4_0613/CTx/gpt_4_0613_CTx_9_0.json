            "content": "The original statement is 'If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished'. This is a conditional statement where being plinked is a sufficient condition for being varnished. In other words, if the twonk was plinked, it must have been varnished.\n\nThe question asks if we can infer 'If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked' from the original statement. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of a statement 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'. \n\nSo, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if it is true that 'If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished', it is also true that 'If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
