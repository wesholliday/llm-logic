This is a conditional statement where 'the smip was shripped' is the condition and 'the smip lupped the zoint' is the result. \n\nThe question asks us to infer 'If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped'. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the condition and the result, and reversing their order. \n\nSo, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer 'If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
