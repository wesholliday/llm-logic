            "content": "The original statement is 'If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled'. This is a conditional statement, where being 'fraggled' is a sufficient condition for being 'smoogled'. \n\nThe question asks if we can infer 'If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled'. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nThe contrapositive of a statement 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'. In this case, P is 'the zinger was fraggled' and Q is 'the zinger was smoogled'. So, 'If not Q then not P' translates to 'If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled'. \n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled' from 'If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled'. \n\nAnswer: yes",
