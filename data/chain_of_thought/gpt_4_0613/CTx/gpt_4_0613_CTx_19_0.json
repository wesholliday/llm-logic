This is a conditional statement, where 'the smonk was vreebled' is the condition and 'the smonk plagged' is the result. \n\nThe question asks if we can infer 'If the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled' from the original statement. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nThe contrapositive of a statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. In this case, P is 'the smonk was vreebled' and Q is 'the smonk plagged'. So, the contrapositive of the original statement is 'If the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled', which is exactly the statement we are asked about.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled' from 'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
