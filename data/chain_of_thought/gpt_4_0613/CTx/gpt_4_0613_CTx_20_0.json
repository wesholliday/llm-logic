This is a conditional statement where 'the fleeg was bluttered' is the condition and 'it surned' is the result. The question asks if we can infer 'If the fleeg did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered' from the original statement. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
