            "content": "The original statement is 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked'. This is a conditional statement, where the morphing of the splat leads to the splat quanking. \n\nThe question asks if we can infer 'If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed' from the original statement. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nThe contrapositive is formed by negating both the condition and the result of the original statement and reversing their order. So, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer 'If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
