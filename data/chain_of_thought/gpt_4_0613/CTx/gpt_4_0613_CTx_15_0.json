The inverse of this statement is 'If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened'. However, the question asks for the contrapositive of the original statement, which is 'If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed'. The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
