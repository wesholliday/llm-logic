This is a conditional statement, where 'the wug was flooped' is the condition and 'the wug bimmed the zoint' is the result. \n\nThe question asks if we can infer 'If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped' from the original statement. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nThe contrapositive of a statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. In this case, P is 'the wug was flooped' and Q is 'the wug bimmed the zoint'. So, the contrapositive of the original statement is 'If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped', which is exactly what the question asks. \n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
