            "content": "The original statement is an example of a conditional statement, which is a logical statement that has two parts, a hypothesis and a conclusion. The statement 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged' can be represented as 'If P, then Q'. \n\nThe question asks if we can infer 'If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked', which is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and reversing their order. So, the contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. \n\nIn logic, a conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive. This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if it is true that 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged', then it is also true that 'If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
