This is a conditional statement where 'the clug was fleeked' is the condition and 'the clug snugged' is the result. \n\nThe question asks if we can infer 'If the clug did not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked' from the given statement. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nThe contrapositive of a statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. In this case, P is 'the clug was fleeked' and Q is 'the clug snugged'. So, 'If not Q, then not P' translates to 'If the clug did not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked', which is exactly the statement we are asked to infer. \n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the clug did not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked' from 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
