            "content": "The original statement is 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled'. This is a conditional statement, where 'the wug was sproinged' is the condition and 'it was garpled' is the result. \n\nThe question asks if we can infer 'If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged' from the original statement. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the condition and the result, and reversing their order. \n\nIn logic, if a conditional statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled' is true, then 'If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged' is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
