            "content": "The original statement is 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked'. This is a conditional statement, where 'the fribble was snurgled' is the condition and 'the fribble crinked' is the result. \n\nThe question asks if we can infer 'If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled' from the original statement. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nThe contrapositive is formed by negating both the condition and the result of the original statement and reversing their order. So, 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked' becomes 'If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled'. \n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled' from 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
