This is a conditional statement where 'the flug was blummed' is the condition and 'the flug was zimmed' is the result. \n\nThe question asks if we can infer 'If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed' from the original statement. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nThe contrapositive of a statement 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'. In this case, P is 'the flug was blummed' and Q is 'the flug was zimmed'. So, the contrapositive of the original statement is 'If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed', which is exactly what the question asks.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed' from 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
