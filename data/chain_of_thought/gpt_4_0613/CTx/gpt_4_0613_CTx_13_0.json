The inverse of this statement is 'If the glip was not slogged, then the glip was not tragged', which is not necessarily true based on the original statement. However, the contrapositive of the original statement, which is 'If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged', is always true if the original statement is true. This is because the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we can infer 'If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged' from 'If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
