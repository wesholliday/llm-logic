This is a conditional statement, where 'the flob was skizzled' is the condition and 'the flob movated' is the result. \n\nThe question asks if we can infer 'If the flob did not movated, then the flob was not skizzled' from the original statement. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the condition and the result and reversing their order. \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. If the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer 'If the flob did not movated, then the flob was not skizzled' from 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
