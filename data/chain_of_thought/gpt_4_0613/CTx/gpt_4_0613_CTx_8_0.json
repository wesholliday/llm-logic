            "content": "The original statement is 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled'. This is a conditional statement, where cranking the sprocket is a sufficient condition for the sprocket to be daggled. \n\nThe question asks if we can infer 'If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked' from the original statement. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nThe contrapositive of a statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. In this case, P is 'the sprocket was cranked' and Q is 'the sprocket was daggled'. So, the contrapositive of the original statement is 'If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked', which is exactly the statement we are asked to infer. \n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer 'If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked' from the original statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
