This implies that whenever Ben studies, he does not do so diligently. \n\nThe second statement is 'If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study'. This is a contradiction because it's impossible for Ben to have studied diligently without studying at all. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first. \n\nAnswer: No",
