This implies that a simple greeting was given, but it was not a warm one. \n\nThe proposed inference is 'If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted'. This is a contradiction because a warm greeting is still a form of greeting. Therefore, it is not possible to greet someone warmly without greeting them at all. \n\nSo, based on the original statement, we cannot infer the proposed statement. \n\nAnswer: No",
