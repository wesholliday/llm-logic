However, this does not necessarily mean that if the directions were clear, they were not given. It's possible that directions could be given and explained clearly, but this situation just doesn't fall under the original statement. The original statement only covers the situation where directions are given but not clear. It doesn't say anything about what happens when directions are clear. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided' from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: No",
