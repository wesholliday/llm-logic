This means that strenuous exercise is not a part of Ann's routine when she exercises.\n\nHowever, the statement 'If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise' is a contradiction. If Ann exercised strenuously, it means she did exercise, but in a strenuous manner. Therefore, it is not possible to infer that if Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
