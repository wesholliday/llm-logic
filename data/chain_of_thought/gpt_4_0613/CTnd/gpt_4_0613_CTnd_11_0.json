This means that going to the store guarantees that vegetables were not bought. \n\nThe inverse of this statement is 'If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store'. This means that buying vegetables guarantees that the store was not visited. \n\nThese two statements are logically equivalent. If going to the store guarantees that vegetables were not bought, then it must also be true that if vegetables were bought, the store was not visited. This is because the two events - going to the store and buying vegetables - are mutually exclusive according to the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes",
