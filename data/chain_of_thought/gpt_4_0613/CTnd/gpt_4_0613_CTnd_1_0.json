This means that the condition of it raining hard is not met when it's just raining. \n\nHowever, the statement 'If it's raining hard, then it's not raining' is not logically consistent with the first statement. If it's raining hard, it's still raining, just at a higher intensity. The first statement does not imply that if it's raining hard, then it's not raining. \n\nSo, we cannot infer 'If it's raining hard, then it's not raining' from 'If it's raining, then it's not raining hard'. \n\nAnswer: No",
