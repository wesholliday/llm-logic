This implies that whenever the room was cleaned, it was done in a way that was not thorough. \n\nThe proposed inference is 'If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned'. This is suggesting that if the room was cleaned in a thorough manner, then it was not cleaned at all. \n\nThese two statements are not logically equivalent. The first statement suggests that cleaning did occur, but it was not thorough. The second statement suggests that if a thorough cleaning occurred, then no cleaning occurred, which is a contradiction. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned' from 'If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly'. \n\nAnswer: No",
