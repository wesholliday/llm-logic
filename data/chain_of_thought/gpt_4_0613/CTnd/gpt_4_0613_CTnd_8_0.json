This means that every time the issue was addressed, it was done so ineffectively. \n\nThe proposed inference is 'If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed'. This is a contradiction because if an issue was addressed effectively, it means that it was indeed addressed. \n\nTherefore, the inference does not logically follow from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: No",
