This implies that whenever Alex exercised, it was not for a long duration or intensity. \n\nThe second statement is 'If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise'. This is a contradiction because it's impossible for Alex to have exercised much and not exercised at the same time. \n\nTherefore, the second statement cannot be inferred from the first. \n\nAnswer: No",
