However, this does not necessarily mean that if the instructions were explained clearly, then they were not given. It's possible that instructions could be given and explained clearly, but this particular statement only addresses the scenario where instructions were given but not explained clearly. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given' from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: No",
