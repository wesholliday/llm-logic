This is a contradiction because if a customer was served promptly, it means that he was indeed served. \n\nTherefore, the inference 'If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served' cannot be made from the original statement 'If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly'. \n\nAnswer: No",
