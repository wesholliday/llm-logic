This means that if Jane did study, it was for a short period of time. \n\nThe statement to infer is 'If Jane studied long, then she did not study'. This statement is contradictory because it's saying that if Jane studied for a long time, then she didn't study at all, which doesn't make sense. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first one. \n\nAnswer: No",
