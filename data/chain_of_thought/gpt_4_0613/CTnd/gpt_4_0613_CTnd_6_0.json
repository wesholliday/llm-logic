This implies that whenever the clothes were washed, they were not washed properly. \n\nThe second statement is 'If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed'. This is a contradiction because it's impossible for the clothes to be washed properly and not washed at the same time. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first one. \n\nAnswer: No",
