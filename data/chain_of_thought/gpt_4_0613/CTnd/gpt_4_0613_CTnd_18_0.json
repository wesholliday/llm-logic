This implies that any discussion that took place was not a deep or thorough one. \n\nHowever, the second statement is asking if it's true that if the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed. This is a contradiction because an issue cannot be discussed in depth without it being discussed at all. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first one. \n\nAnswer: No",
