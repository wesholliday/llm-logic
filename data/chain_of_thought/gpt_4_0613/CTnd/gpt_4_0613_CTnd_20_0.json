This means that any recommendation that was made was not strong. \n\nThe second statement is 'If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made'. This is a contradiction because a strong recommendation is a type of recommendation. Therefore, if a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was indeed made. \n\nSo, we cannot infer the second statement from the first one. The first statement only tells us about the strength of the recommendation, not about the existence of a recommendation. \n\nAnswer: No",
