This implies that whenever the meal was prepared, it was done so in a manner that was not careful. \n\nThe proposed inference is 'If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared'. This statement is contradictory because it suggests that a meal that was prepared carefully was somehow not prepared at all. \n\nIn other words, the original statement suggests that the meal was prepared, but not carefully. The proposed inference, on the other hand, suggests that if the meal was prepared carefully, then it wasn't prepared at all, which is a contradiction. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared' from 'If the meal was prepared, then it was not prepared carefully'. \n\nAnswer: No",
