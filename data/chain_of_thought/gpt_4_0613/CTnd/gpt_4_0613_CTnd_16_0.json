This implies that any job that was completed was not done so in a satisfactory manner. \n\nThe second statement 'If the job was completed well, then it was not completed' is a contradiction. If a job was completed well, it means that the job was indeed completed. \n\nTherefore, the second statement cannot be inferred from the first. \n\nAnswer: No",
