In this case, P is \"the alien visited Mars\" and Q is \"the robot must have visited Jupiter\". \n\nThe second statement is the negation of Q, which can be represented as \"not Q\". \n\nAccording to the rules of logic, if \"If P, then Q\" is true and \"not Q\" is also true, then we can infer \"not P\". This is known as Modus Tollens in logic. \n\nSo, in this case, if \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter\" is true and \"It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter\" is also true, then we can infer \"The alien did not visit Mars\". \n\nAnswer: Yes",
