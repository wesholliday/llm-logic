It means that if the first part (the shirt being cotton) is true, then the second part (the pants being denim) must also be true. \n\nThe second statement 'It's not the case that the pants must have been denim' negates the second part of the conditional statement. \n\nIf the second part of the conditional statement is not true, then the first part (the shirt being cotton) cannot be true either. This is because in a conditional statement, if the result is false, then the condition must also be false. \n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The shirt was not cotton'. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
