The second statement contradicts the second part of the first statement, saying that it's not the case that the truck must have been metal. \n\nIf we assume that the first statement is true, then the only way for the second statement to also be true is if the first part of the first statement (the doll was plastic) is not true. This is because if the doll was plastic, then according to the first statement, the truck must have been metal, which contradicts the second statement. \n\nTherefore, if both statements are true, we can infer that the doll was not plastic. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
