It tells us that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob's choice is determined - he must have chosen pasta. \n\nThe second statement, 'It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta', tells us that Bob's choice is not determined - he did not necessarily choose pasta. \n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza. This is because if Sue had chosen pizza, then Bob would have had to choose pasta, according to the first statement. But the second statement tells us that Bob did not necessarily choose pasta. Therefore, Sue could not have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
