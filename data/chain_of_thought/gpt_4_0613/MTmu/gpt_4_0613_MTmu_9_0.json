This means that Lisa buying the red shirt is a sufficient condition for Mark buying the blue shirt. \n\nThe second statement tells us that it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This means that the condition for Mark buying the blue shirt (which is Lisa buying the red shirt) did not occur. \n\nTherefore, if the condition for Mark buying the blue shirt did not occur, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
