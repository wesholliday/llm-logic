            "content": "The first statement establishes a condition: if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. This is a conditional statement, where the presence of the bear in the cave implies the presence of the wolf in the den. \n\nThe second statement tells us that it's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den. This contradicts the result of the condition in the first statement.\n\nIn logic, if we have a statement of the form \"If P then Q\", and we know that Q is false, then we can infer that P is also false. This is known as modus tollens. \n\nIn this case, P is \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q is \"the wolf must have been in the den\". The second statement tells us that Q is false. Therefore, we can infer that P is also false, i.e., the bear was not in the cave. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
