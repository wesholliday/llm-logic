In this case, P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins must have been blueberry\". The second statement is the negation of Q, which can be represented as \"not Q\". \n\nAccording to the rules of logic, if \"If P, then Q\" is true and \"not Q\" is also true, then we can infer \"not P\". This is known as modus tollens. \n\nSo, if it's true that \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry\" and it's also true that \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry\", then we can infer \"The cake was not chocolate\". \n\nAnswer: Yes",
