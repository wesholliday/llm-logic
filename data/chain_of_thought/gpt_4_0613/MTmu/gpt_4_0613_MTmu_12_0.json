This means that Joe's going to the park necessitates Lucy's going to the zoo. \n\nThe second statement tells us that it's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This means that the condition for Lucy going to the zoo (which is Joe going to the park) did not occur. \n\nTherefore, if Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
