If we assume that the first statement is true, then the only way for Jen not to have watched basketball is if Tom did not watch football. This is because, according to the first statement, Tom watching football would necessarily mean that Jen watched basketball. Since we know that Jen did not watch basketball, we can infer that Tom did not watch football. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
