This is a conditional statement where Jeff playing basketball is the condition for Amy playing tennis. \n\nThe second statement tells us that Amy did not play tennis. \n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball. This is because if Jeff had played basketball, then Amy would have had to play tennis, according to the first statement. But since Amy did not play tennis, it follows that Jeff could not have played basketball. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
