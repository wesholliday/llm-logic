It tells us that if the first part (the car being red) is true, then the second part (the truck being blue) must also be true. \n\nThe second statement, 'It's not the case that the truck must have been blue', tells us that the second part of the conditional statement is not true. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the second part is not true, then the first part must also not be true. This is known as the contrapositive. \n\nSo, if it's not the case that the truck must have been blue, then it must also not be the case that the car was red. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
