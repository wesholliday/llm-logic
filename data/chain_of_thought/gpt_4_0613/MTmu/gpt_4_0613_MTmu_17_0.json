The second statement tells us that it's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad. If we assume that the first statement is true, then the only way for the second statement to also be true is if Ben did not eat pasta. If Ben had eaten pasta, then according to the first statement, Kate would have had to eat the salad, which contradicts the second statement. Therefore, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta. \n\nAnswer: yes",
