This means that the presence of the griffin in the forest necessitates the presence of the unicorn in the forest. \n\nThe second statement contradicts the condition of the first statement by asserting that it's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest. \n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that the condition for the griffin being in the forest (i.e., the unicorn being in the forest) was not met. Therefore, the griffin could not have been in the forest. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
