This is a conditional statement, where the vampire being awake is the condition for the mummy being awake. \n\nThe second statement tells us that it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake. This means that the condition for the vampire being awake (which is the mummy being awake) did not occur.\n\nIn a conditional statement, if the result (the mummy being awake) is false, then the condition (the vampire being awake) must also be false. This is because the condition is necessary for the result to occur. If the result did not occur, then the condition could not have occurred.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the vampire was not awake. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
