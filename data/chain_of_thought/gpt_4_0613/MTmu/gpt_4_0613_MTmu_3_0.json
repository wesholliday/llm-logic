The second statement tells us that it's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel. This means that the book could be something other than a mystery novel. If every book written by James is a mystery novel, and this book could be something other than a mystery novel, then it follows that this book could not have been written by James. Therefore, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
