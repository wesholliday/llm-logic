            "content": "The statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow' is a conditional statement. In logic, if we have a conditional statement 'If P then Q', and we know that 'Q' is false, then we can infer that 'P' is also false. This is known as modus tollens. In this case, 'P' is 'the apple was red' and 'Q' is 'the banana must have been yellow'. We are told that 'It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow', which means 'Q' is false. Therefore, we can infer that 'P', 'the apple was red', is also false. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
