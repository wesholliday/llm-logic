This means that Mary's presence at the wedding necessitates Sue's presence. \n\nThe second statement contradicts the condition of Sue's presence: it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding. This is because if Mary were at the wedding, Sue would have to be there as well, according to the first statement. But since Sue was not at the wedding, Mary could not have been there either. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
