The second statement introduces the possibility that the dreb might not be spened. However, it does not confirm that the dreb is not spened, only that it might not be. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the dreb is vroombed, because there is still a possibility that it could be spened. \n\nAnswer: No",
