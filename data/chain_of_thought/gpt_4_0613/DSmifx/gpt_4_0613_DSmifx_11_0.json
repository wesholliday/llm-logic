This is an either-or situation, meaning that if one condition is not met, the other must be. The second statement introduces the possibility that the flug might not be zimmed. However, it does not confirm that the flug is not zimmed, it only suggests that it's a possibility. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the flug is blummed, because there is still a chance that it could be zimmed. \n\nAnswer: no",
