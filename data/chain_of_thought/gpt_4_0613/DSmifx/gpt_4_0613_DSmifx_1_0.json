The second statement introduces the possibility that the flugel might not be zargled. However, this does not confirm that the flugel is not zargled, it only introduces the possibility. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the flugel is blimmed. The flugel could still be zargled, or it could be neither zargled nor blimmed if the initial statement was not exhaustive of all possibilities. \n\nAnswer: No",
