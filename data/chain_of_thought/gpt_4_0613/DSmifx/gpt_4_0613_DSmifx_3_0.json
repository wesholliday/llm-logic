The second statement introduces the possibility that the splat might not be quanked. However, this does not definitively confirm that the splat is not quanked, only that it might not be. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the splat is morphed, because it's still possible that it could be quanked. \n\nAnswer: no",
