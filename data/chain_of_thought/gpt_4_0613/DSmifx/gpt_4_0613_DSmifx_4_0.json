The second statement introduces uncertainty about the fribble being crinked. However, it does not definitively state that the fribble is not crinked. It only suggests that it might not be. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the fribble is snurgled. The fribble could still potentially be crinked, which would satisfy the conditions of the first statement without requiring the fribble to be snurgled.\n\nAnswer: no",
