The second statement introduces the possibility that the fleeg might not be surned. However, this does not confirm that the fleeg is not surned, it only suggests it as a possibility. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the fleeg is bluttered based on these two statements. The fleeg might not be surned, but it also might be surned. We don't have enough information to make a definitive conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
