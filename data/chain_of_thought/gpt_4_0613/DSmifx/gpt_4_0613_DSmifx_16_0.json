The second statement introduces the possibility that the sneg might not be sproted. However, this does not guarantee that the sneg is not sproted, it only suggests that it's a possibility. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the sneg is crampled based on these two statements. The sneg might not be sproted, but it also might be sproted. We don't have enough information to make a definitive conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
