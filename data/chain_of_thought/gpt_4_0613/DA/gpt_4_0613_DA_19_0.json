It tells us what happens if a certain condition (Tom watching football) is met. However, it does not tell us what happens if that condition is not met. In other words, it does not tell us anything about whether or not Jen watched basketball if Tom did not watch football. Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer that 'Jen did not watch basketball'. \n\nAnswer: No",
