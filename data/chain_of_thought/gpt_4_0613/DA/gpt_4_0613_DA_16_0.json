It tells us that if a certain condition is met (the shirt being cotton), then a certain outcome will occur (the pants being denim). However, it does not tell us what will happen if the condition is not met. \n\nThe second statement 'The shirt was not cotton' tells us that the condition in the first statement was not met. However, because the first statement does not tell us what happens when the condition is not met, we cannot infer anything about the pants from these two statements alone. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The pants were not denim' from these two statements. \n\nAnswer: No",
