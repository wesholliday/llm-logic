It tells us that if a certain condition is met (the bear being in the cave), then a certain outcome will occur (the wolf being in the den). However, it does not tell us what will happen if the condition is not met. \n\nThe second statement 'The bear was not in the cave' tells us that the condition for the first statement is not met. However, this does not necessarily mean that the outcome (the wolf being in the den) will not occur. The wolf could be in the den for other reasons, or it could be in the den regardless of where the bear is. \n\nTherefore, from these two statements, we cannot infer that 'The wolf was not in the den'.",
