It tells us that if the first event happened (the alien visiting Mars), then the second event (the robot visiting Jupiter) also happened. However, it does not tell us what happens if the first event did not happen. \n\nThe second statement 'The alien did not visit Mars' tells us that the first event in the conditional statement did not happen. However, this does not allow us to infer anything about the second event (the robot visiting Jupiter). The robot could have visited Jupiter for other reasons, or it could have not visited Jupiter. We simply do not have enough information to make an inference.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer 'The robot did not visit Jupiter'. \n\nAnswer: No",
