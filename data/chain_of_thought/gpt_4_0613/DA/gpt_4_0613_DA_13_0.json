            "content": "The statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' is a conditional statement. It tells us that if a certain condition (the car being red) is met, then a certain outcome (the truck being blue) will follow. However, it does not tell us what happens if the condition is not met. \n\nThe second statement 'The car was not red' tells us that the condition in the first statement is not met. However, this does not allow us to infer anything about the color of the truck. The truck could still be blue, or it could be any other color. The first statement does not provide any information about what the color of the truck is when the car is not red.\n\nTherefore, from these two statements, we cannot infer 'The truck was not blue'. \n\nAnswer: No",
