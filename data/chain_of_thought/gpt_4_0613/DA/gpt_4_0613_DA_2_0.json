            "content": "The statement 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest' establishes a condition where the presence of the griffin guarantees the presence of the unicorn. However, it does not establish the reverse condition, i.e., the absence of the griffin does not guarantee the absence of the unicorn. The unicorn could be in the forest independently of the griffin. Therefore, from the statement 'The griffin was not in the forest', we cannot infer 'The unicorn was not in the forest'.\n\nAnswer: no",
