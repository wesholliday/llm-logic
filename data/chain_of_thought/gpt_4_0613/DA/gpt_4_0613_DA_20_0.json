However, it does not tell us what happens if the apple was not red. Therefore, from the statement 'The apple was not red', we cannot infer anything about the color of the banana. The banana could still be yellow or it could be of any other color. The information given does not provide a definitive answer to the color of the banana if the apple was not red. \n\nAnswer: No",
