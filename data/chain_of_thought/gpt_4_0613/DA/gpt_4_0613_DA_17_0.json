However, it does not tell us what happens if that condition is not met. In other words, it does not tell us what happens if Ben does not eat pasta. Therefore, from the statement 'Ben did not eat pasta', we cannot infer anything about whether or not Kate ate the salad. The two events could be unrelated, or it could be that Kate eats the salad regardless of whether or not Ben eats pasta. We simply do not have enough information to make an inference.",
