The question is asking if we can infer 'The book is not a mystery novel' from these statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, stating that if a certain condition is met (the book was written by James), then a certain outcome is true (the book is a mystery novel). The second statement tells us that the condition is not met (the book was not written by James).\n\nHowever, the first statement does not tell us anything about the genre of the book if it was not written by James. It could still be a mystery novel, even if it was written by someone else. Therefore, we cannot infer that the book is not a mystery novel just because it was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: No",
