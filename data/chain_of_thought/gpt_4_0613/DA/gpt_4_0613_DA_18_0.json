It tells us that if a certain condition is met (the doll being plastic), then another condition is also met (the truck being metal). However, it does not tell us what happens if the first condition is not met. \n\nThe second statement 'The doll was not plastic' tells us that the first condition of the conditional statement is not met. However, this does not necessarily mean that the second condition (the truck being metal) is also not met. The truck could still be metal even if the doll is not plastic. \n\nTherefore, from these two statements, we cannot infer that 'The truck was not metal'. \n\nAnswer: No",
