            "content": "The statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is a conditional statement. It tells us what happens if the vampire is awake, but it doesn't tell us what happens if the vampire is not awake. The second statement 'The vampire was not awake' tells us that the condition for the first statement is not met. However, this does not necessarily mean that the mummy was not awake. The mummy could be awake or not awake independently of the vampire's state. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The mummy was not awake' from these two statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
