It tells us that if a certain condition (the cake being chocolate) is true, then another condition (the muffins being blueberry) is also true. However, it does not tell us what happens if the first condition is not true. \n\nThe second statement 'The cake was not chocolate' tells us that the first condition of the conditional statement is not true. However, this does not allow us to infer anything about the second condition (the muffins being blueberry). The muffins could still be blueberry even if the cake is not chocolate. \n\nTherefore, from these two statements, we cannot infer 'The muffins were not blueberry'. \n\nAnswer: No",
