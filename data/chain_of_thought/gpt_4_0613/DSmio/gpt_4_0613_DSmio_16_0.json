This means that if the pen is not in one place, it must be in the other.\n\nHowever, since the first statement only suggests a possibility and doesn't confirm that the pen is not on the desk, we cannot definitively infer that the pen is in the bag. The pen could still be on the desk.\n\nAnswer: No",
