This means that if the keys are not in one place, they must be in the other.\n\nHowever, because the first statement only tells us that the keys might not be in the cabinet, and doesn't definitively rule out the possibility that they could be there, we can't definitively conclude that the keys are in the drawer. \n\nAnswer: No",
