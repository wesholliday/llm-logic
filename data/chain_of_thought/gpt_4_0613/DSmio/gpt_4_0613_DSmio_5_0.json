This means that there is a possibility that the cookies are not in the pantry, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that they could be there.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the cookies are either in the jar or in the pantry. This means that if the cookies are not in one place, they must be in the other.\n\nHowever, because the first statement only tells us that the cookies might not be in the pantry (not that they definitely aren't), we can't definitively conclude that the cookies are in the jar. They could still potentially be in the pantry.\n\nAnswer: No",
