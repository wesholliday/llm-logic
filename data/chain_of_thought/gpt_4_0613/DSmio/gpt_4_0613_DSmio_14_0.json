If we combine these two statements, we can infer that if the milk is not chilling in the fridge, then it must be on the counter. However, the first statement only tells us that the milk might not be chilling in the fridge, not that it definitely isn't. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the milk is on the counter. \n\nAnswer: no",
