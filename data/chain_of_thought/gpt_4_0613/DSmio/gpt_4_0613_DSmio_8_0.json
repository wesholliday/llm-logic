The second statement tells us that the remote control is either on the coffee table or under the couch. Given these two statements, we can't definitively say that the remote control is on the coffee table. It could still be under the couch, because the first statement only said that it might not be there, not that it definitely isn't. Therefore, we can't infer that the remote control is on the coffee table. \n\nAnswer: No",
