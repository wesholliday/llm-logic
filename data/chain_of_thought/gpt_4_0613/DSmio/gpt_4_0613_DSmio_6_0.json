The second statement tells us that either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen. If we assume that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen, then according to the second statement, the phone must be in the living room. However, the first statement only tells us that the phone might not be ringing in the kitchen, not that it definitely isn't. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the phone is in the living room. \n\nAnswer: No",
