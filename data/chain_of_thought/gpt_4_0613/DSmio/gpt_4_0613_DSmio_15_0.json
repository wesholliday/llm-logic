This means that there is a possibility that the shoes are not by the door. \n\nThe second statement tells us that the shoes are either in the closet or they must be lined up by the door. This is a binary condition, meaning the shoes have to be in one of these two places.\n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can infer that since the shoes might not be by the door, the only other option given to us is that they are in the closet. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
