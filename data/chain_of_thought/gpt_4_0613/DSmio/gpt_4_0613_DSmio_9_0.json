This means that it's possible that the puzzle piece is not on the floor. \n\nThe second statement tells us that either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor. This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two parts of the statement must be true.\n\nIf it's possible that the puzzle piece is not on the floor, then in order for the second statement to be true, the puzzle piece must be in the box. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
