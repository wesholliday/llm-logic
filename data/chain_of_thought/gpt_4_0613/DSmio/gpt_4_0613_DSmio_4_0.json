The second statement tells us that the cat is either napping on the couch or playing in the bedroom. If we combine these two statements, we can infer that since the cat might not be playing in the bedroom, it must be napping on the couch. This is because the second statement gives us only two options for the cat's location and activity, and if one option (playing in the bedroom) is potentially ruled out by the first statement, then the other option (napping on the couch) must be the case. \n\nAnswer: yes",
