The proposed inference is essentially restating the same thing, but with a slight change in wording. It still maintains that the quibble must be one of the two options, either \"floob on the froodle\" or \"snork on the zump\". The meaning of the statement remains the same, so we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
