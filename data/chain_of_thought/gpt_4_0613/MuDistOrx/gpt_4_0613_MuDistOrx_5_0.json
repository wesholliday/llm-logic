The proposed inference is \"The plonk must be on wibble or it must be on shimble\". This statement also means that the plonk has to be either on wibble or on shimble. Both statements are saying the same thing, just in slightly different ways. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
