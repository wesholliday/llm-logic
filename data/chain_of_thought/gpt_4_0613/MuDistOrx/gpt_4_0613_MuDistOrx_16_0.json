            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence states that the blimp must be \"wump\" by either the frazzle blimple or the plimp. This implies that there are two possibilities for the blimp to be \"wump\". The rephrased sentence maintains the same meaning, stating that the blimp must be \"wump\" by either the frazzle blimple or it must be \"wump\" by the plimp. The two sentences are logically equivalent, so we can infer the rephrased sentence from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
