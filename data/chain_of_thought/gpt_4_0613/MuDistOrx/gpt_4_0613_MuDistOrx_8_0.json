            "content": "Explanation: The original statement, \"The floob must be quork or be frazzle\", implies that the floob has two options: it can either be quork or it can be frazzle. The proposed inference, \"The floob must be quork or it must be frazzle\", is essentially saying the same thing. Both statements are expressing that the floob has to be one of the two options, quork or frazzle. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
