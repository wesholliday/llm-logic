This means that there are two possibilities for the location of the wumble: it is either on the frozz or it is in the shimble. The rephrased statement is saying the same thing, just with slightly different wording. It still presents the same two possibilities for the location of the wumble: it must be on the frozz or it must be in the shimble. Therefore, the rephrased statement can be inferred from the original statement because they both convey the same meaning.\n\nAnswer: yes",
