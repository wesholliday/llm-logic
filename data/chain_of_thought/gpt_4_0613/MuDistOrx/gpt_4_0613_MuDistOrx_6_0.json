            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence states that the blimp must do one of two things: either gribble a flonk or gribble a wibble snorkel. The proposed inference is essentially the same, but with the addition of \"it must\" before the second option. This doesn't change the meaning of the sentence, it just makes it more explicit that the blimp must do one or the other. Therefore, we can infer the second sentence from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
