            "content": "Explanation: The sentence 'The zibber must gronk a quank or gronk a zump crunk' implies that the zibber has two options: either to gronk a quank or to gronk a zump crunk. The proposed inference 'The zibber must gronk a quank or it must gronk a zump crunk' is essentially saying the same thing, just with a slightly different phrasing. The 'it' in the second sentence refers back to 'the zibber', and the 'must' is simply repeated for emphasis. Therefore, the meaning of the two sentences is the same.\n\nAnswer: yes",
