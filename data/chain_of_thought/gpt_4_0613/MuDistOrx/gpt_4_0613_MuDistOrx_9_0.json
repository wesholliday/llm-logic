            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence states that the snorkel must be \"flim\" by either \"quank\" or \"fribble\". The proposed inference is essentially restating the same information, just with slightly different wording. It still maintains that the snorkel must be \"flim\" by either \"quank\" or \"fribble\". Therefore, the inference is valid because it does not change the meaning or conditions of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
