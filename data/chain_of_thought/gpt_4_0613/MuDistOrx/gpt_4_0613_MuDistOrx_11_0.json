The rephrased statement also presents these two possibilities, just in a slightly different way. It says that the shimble must be snizzle plonk, or alternatively, it must be zibber. Both statements are presenting the same two options for what the shimble could be, so we can infer the rephrased statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
