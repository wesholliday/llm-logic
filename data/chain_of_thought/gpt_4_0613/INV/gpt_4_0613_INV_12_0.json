It tells us what happens if a certain condition (Joe going to the park) is met. However, it does not tell us what happens if that condition is not met. In other words, it does not tell us what happens if Joe does not go to the park. Therefore, we cannot infer from this statement that \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\". This would be a logical fallacy known as denying the antecedent.\n\nAnswer: No",
