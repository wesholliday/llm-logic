            "content": "The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is a conditional statement. It tells us what happens if a certain condition (Jeff playing basketball) is met. However, it does not tell us what happens if that condition is not met. In other words, it does not tell us what happens if Jeff did not play basketball. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis\" from the given statement. Amy might have played tennis even if Jeff did not play basketball. The original statement does not provide information about this scenario. \n\nAnswer: No",
