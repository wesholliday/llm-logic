This means that Lisa buying the red shirt is a sufficient condition for Mark buying the blue shirt. However, it does not provide any information about what happens when Lisa does not buy the red shirt. Mark could still buy the blue shirt even if Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt' from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: No",
