This is a conditional statement, where the vampire being awake is the condition for the mummy being awake. However, this statement does not provide information about what happens when the vampire is not awake. The mummy could still be awake even if the vampire is not. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake' from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: No",
