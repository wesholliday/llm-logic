This is a conditional statement where the pants being denim is dependent on the shirt being cotton. However, the statement does not provide information about what happens when the shirt is not cotton. The pants could still be denim even if the shirt is not cotton. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
