It tells us that whenever the cake is chocolate, the muffins are blueberry. However, it does not tell us anything about what happens when the cake is not chocolate. The muffins could still be blueberry, or they could be a different flavor. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry' from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: No",
