It tells us about a situation where if one condition is true (the doll being plastic), then another condition is also true (the truck being metal). However, it does not provide any information about what happens when the first condition is not true (the doll not being plastic). We cannot infer anything about the material of the truck in this case. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
