            "content": "The original statement is 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside'. This is a conditional statement where the dog being inside is the condition for the cat being outside. \n\nThe question asks if we can infer 'If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside' from the original statement. This is the inverse of the original statement. \n\nIn logic, the inverse of a conditional statement does not necessarily hold true. Just because the cat is outside when the dog is inside, it doesn't mean that the cat cannot be outside when the dog is not inside. The cat could be outside for other reasons, not just because the dog is inside. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside' from 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside'. \n\nAnswer: No",
