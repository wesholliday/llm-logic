This means that the presence of the griffin in the forest guarantees the presence of the unicorn in the forest. However, it does not provide any information about what happens when the griffin is not in the forest. The unicorn could still be in the forest even if the griffin is not. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest\" from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: No",
