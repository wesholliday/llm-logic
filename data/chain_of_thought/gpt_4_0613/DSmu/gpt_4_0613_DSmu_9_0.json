The second statement negates one of these possibilities, stating that it's not the case that the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor. With this possibility eliminated, the only remaining option from the original two is that the missing puzzle piece is in the box. Therefore, we can infer from these two statements that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
