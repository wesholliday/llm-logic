The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities, stating that it's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist. With this possibility removed, the only remaining option for the location of the watch, based on the information given, is that it's charging on the dresser. Therefore, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
