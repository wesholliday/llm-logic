The second statement negates one of these possibilities, stating that the cat is not playing in the bedroom. Given that these are the only two options presented for the cat's location, if one is negated, the other must be true. Therefore, if the cat is not playing in the bedroom, it must be napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
