            "content": "The argument is logically valid. The premise 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding' implies that there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding. This is because if it was necessary for Mary to be at the wedding, then there would be no possibility of her not being there. However, since the premise denies this necessity, it opens up the possibility of her not being there. The conclusion 'Mary might not have been at the wedding' is therefore logically derived from the premise, making the argument valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
