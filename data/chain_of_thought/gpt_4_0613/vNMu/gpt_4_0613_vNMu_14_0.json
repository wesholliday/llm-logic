This is because if it were necessary for the milk to be on the counter, then it would always be on the counter. But the premise denies this necessity. Therefore, it allows for the possibility that the milk is not on the counter. This is exactly what the conclusion 'The milk might not be on the counter' states. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premise. \n\nAnswer: yes",
