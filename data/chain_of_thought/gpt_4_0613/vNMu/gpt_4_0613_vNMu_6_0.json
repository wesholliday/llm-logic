This is because saying 'Sue must have chosen pizza' would mean that there is no other possibility but for Sue to have chosen pizza. Therefore, if it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza, it means there are other possibilities, including the possibility that Sue did not choose pizza. This directly leads to the conclusion 'Sue might not have chosen pizza'. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premise. \n\nAnswer: yes",
