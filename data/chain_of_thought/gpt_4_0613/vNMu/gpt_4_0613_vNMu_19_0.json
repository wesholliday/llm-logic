This means that there are other possibilities for where the watch could be charging, or it might not be charging at all. Therefore, the conclusion that the watch might not be charging on the dresser is a logical deduction from the premise. The conclusion does not contradict the premise and is a possible scenario given the premise. Therefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
