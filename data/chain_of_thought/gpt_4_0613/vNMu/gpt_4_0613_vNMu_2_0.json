In this case, the premise is 'It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest'. This means that there is a possibility that the griffin was not in the forest. The conclusion is 'The griffin might not have been in the forest', which is a restatement of the possibility that the griffin was not in the forest. Therefore, the conclusion does follow necessarily from the premise, making the argument logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
