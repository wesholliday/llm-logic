            "content": "Explanation: The original statement says that the car must have been in the garage and needed repairs. This statement is a conjunction of two separate statements: 'The car must have been in the garage' and 'The car must have needed repairs'. The conjunction of two statements is true if and only if both of the statements are true. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then both of the separate statements must also be true. So, if 'The car must have been in the garage and needed repairs' is true, then 'The car must have needed repairs' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
