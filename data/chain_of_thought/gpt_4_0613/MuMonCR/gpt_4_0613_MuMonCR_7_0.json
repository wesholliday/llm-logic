This statement is a conjunction of two separate statements: \"The exam must have been difficult\" and \"The exam must have covered all chapters\". The conjunction of two statements is true if and only if both of the statements are true. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then both of the separate statements must also be true. So, if \"The exam must have been difficult and covered all chapters\" is true, then \"The exam must have covered all chapters\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
