            "content": "Explanation: The original statement says that the contract must have been valid for a year and renewable. This means that the contract had two conditions: it had to be valid for a year, and it had to be renewable. Therefore, if we are asked whether we can infer from this statement that the contract must have been renewable, the answer is yes, because the renewability of the contract is explicitly stated in the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
