It is also stated that the cookies might not be in the pantry. However, this does not definitively rule out the pantry as a possible location for the cookies, as \"might not\" implies uncertainty rather than a definite no. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the cookies are in the jar based on the information given. \n\nAnswer: No",
