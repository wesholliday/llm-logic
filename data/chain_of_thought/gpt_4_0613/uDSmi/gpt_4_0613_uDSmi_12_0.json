It is also stated that the jacket might not be hanging in the closet. This does not definitively rule out the possibility of the jacket being in the closet, but it does suggest that it might not be there. However, if we assume that the jacket is not in the closet, then the only remaining possibility presented is that the jacket is draped over the chair. Therefore, under the assumption that the jacket is not in the closet, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
