It is also stated that the keys might not be in the cabinet. This does not definitively rule out the cabinet as a possible location, it only suggests that it's possible the keys are not there. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the keys are in the drawer based on this information. The keys could still potentially be in the cabinet or in neither of the two locations mentioned. \n\nAnswer: No",
