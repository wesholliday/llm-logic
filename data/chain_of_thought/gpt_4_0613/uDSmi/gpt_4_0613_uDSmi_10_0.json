However, it also states that the sock might not be under the bed. This doesn't definitively rule out the possibility of the sock being under the bed, it just makes it less likely. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the sock is in the laundry basket based on the information given. The sock could still potentially be under the bed, or even in a location not mentioned in the statement. \n\nAnswer: No",
