            "content": "Explanation: The original statement provides two pieces of information about the location of the envelope: it was upstairs and it was under a bed. If we know that the envelope was upstairs and under a bed, then it must have been upstairs. The second part of the location (under a bed) does not negate or contradict the first part of the location (upstairs). Therefore, we can infer from the original statement that the envelope was upstairs.\n\nAnswer: yes",
