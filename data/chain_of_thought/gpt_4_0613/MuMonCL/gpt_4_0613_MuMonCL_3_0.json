This statement is a conjunction of two separate statements: 'The car must have been in the garage' and 'The car needed repairs'. If the conjunction of these two statements is true, then each individual statement must also be true. Therefore, if 'The car must have been in the garage and needed repairs' is true, then 'The car must have been in the garage' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
