This means that the length of the password is eight characters, and it must include a number. The second statement is asking if we can infer that the password must have been eight characters long. Since the original statement already specifies that the password must be eight characters long, we can infer that the password must have been eight characters long from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
