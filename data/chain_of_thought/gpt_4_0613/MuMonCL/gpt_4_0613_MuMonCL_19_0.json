This means that the application process had two requirements: it had to be completed online and it had to include references. Therefore, if we are asked whether we can infer from this statement that the application must have been completed online, the answer is yes, because that is one of the two requirements explicitly stated in the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
