This means that it is not a necessity for the jacket to be draped over the chair. The conclusion, \"It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair\", is essentially saying the same thing - that it is not a requirement or necessity for the jacket to be draped over the chair. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premise. \n\nAnswer: yes",
