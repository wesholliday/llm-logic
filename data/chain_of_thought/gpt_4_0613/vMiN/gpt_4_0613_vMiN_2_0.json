This means there is at least one scenario where the griffin is not in the forest. The conclusion states that it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest. This conclusion is true if there is at least one scenario where the griffin is not in the forest. Since the premise and conclusion are based on the same scenario, the argument is valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
