If there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza, then it cannot be the case that 'Sue must have chosen pizza', because 'must' implies necessity or certainty. Therefore, the conclusion 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza' logically follows from the premise 'Sue might not have chosen pizza'. \n\nAnswer: yes",
