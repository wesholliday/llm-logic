If there is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars, then it cannot be the case that the alien must have visited Mars. The word 'must' implies necessity or certainty, which is contradicted by the possibility of the alien not visiting Mars. Therefore, the conclusion 'It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars' logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
