This means that it is not a certainty that the sunglasses are in her bag. The conclusion, 'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag', is essentially saying the same thing - that it is not a certainty that the sunglasses are in her bag. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premise. \n\nAnswer: yes",
