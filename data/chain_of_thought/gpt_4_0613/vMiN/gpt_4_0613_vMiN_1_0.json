If there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding, then it cannot be the case that Mary must have been at the wedding. 'Must' implies necessity or certainty, which is contradicted by the possibility of Mary not being at the wedding. Therefore, the conclusion 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding' logically follows from the premise. \n\nAnswer: yes",
