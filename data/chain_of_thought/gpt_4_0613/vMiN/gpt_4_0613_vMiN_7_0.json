This directly negates the statement 'Alex must have finished the race', which implies that it is certain that Alex finished the race. Therefore, if it is possible that Alex did not finish the race, it cannot be the case that Alex must have finished the race. The conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
