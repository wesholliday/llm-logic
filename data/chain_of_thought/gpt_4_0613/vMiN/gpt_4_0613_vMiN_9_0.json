If there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then it cannot be the case that 'Lisa must have bought the red shirt', because 'must' implies certainty or necessity. Therefore, the conclusion 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt' logically follows from the premise 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt'. \n\nAnswer: yes",
