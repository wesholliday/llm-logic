If we combine these two statements, we can infer that if the splat did not quank, then it could not have been morphed, because being morphed necessitates quanking. Therefore, since the splat might not have quanked, it is possible that the splat was not morphed. However, this does not definitively prove that the splat was not morphed, because it is also possible that the splat was morphed and did quank. \n\nAnswer: No",
