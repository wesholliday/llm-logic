The second statement tells us that if the sneg was crampled, then it must have sproted the frink. \n\nIf the sneg was crampled, then according to the second statement, it must have sproted the frink. But the first statement tells us that the sneg might not have sproted the frink. This means that there is a possibility that the sneg was not crampled, because if it was, it would contradict the first statement. \n\nTherefore, based on these two statements, we can infer that the sneg was not crampled. \n\nAnswer: yes",
