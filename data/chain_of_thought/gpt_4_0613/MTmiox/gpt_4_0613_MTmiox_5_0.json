The second statement tells us that if the zinger was fraggled, then it must have been smoogled. \n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can infer that if the zinger was not smoogled, then it could not have been fraggled. This is because the second statement tells us that being fraggled necessitates being smoogled. \n\nTherefore, if it is possible that the zinger was not smoogled, then it must be possible that the zinger was not fraggled. \n\nAnswer: Yes.",
