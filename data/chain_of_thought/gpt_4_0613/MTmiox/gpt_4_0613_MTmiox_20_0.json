If we combine these two statements, we can infer that if the fleeg was not surned, then it could not have been bluttered, because being bluttered requires it to have been surned. Therefore, since it's possible the fleeg was not surned, it's also possible that the fleeg was not bluttered. However, this does not definitively prove that the fleeg was not bluttered, because it's also possible that the fleeg was both bluttered and surned. \n\nAnswer: No",
