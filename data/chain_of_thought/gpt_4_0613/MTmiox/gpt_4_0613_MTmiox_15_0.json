The second statement tells us that if the dreb was vroombed, then it must have been spened. \n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can infer that if the dreb was vroombed, it would contradict the first statement because it would mean the dreb was spened. Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, we can infer that the dreb was not vroombed. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
