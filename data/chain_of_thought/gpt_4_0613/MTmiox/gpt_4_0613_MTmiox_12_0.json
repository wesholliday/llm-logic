The second statement tells us that if the smip was shripped, then it must have lupped the zoint. \n\nIf the smip was shripped, then according to the second statement, it must have lupped the zoint. But the first statement tells us that the smip might not have lupped the zoint. This contradiction implies that the smip could not have been shripped, because if it were, it would have had to lup the zoint, which the first statement says might not be the case.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
