If we combine these two statements, we can infer that if the glip did not trag, then it could not have been slogged, because being slogged requires that it must have tragged. Therefore, since it's possible that the glip did not trag, it's also possible that the glip was not slogged. However, this does not definitively prove that the glip was not slogged, because it's also possible that the glip did trag. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the glip was not slogged based on these statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
