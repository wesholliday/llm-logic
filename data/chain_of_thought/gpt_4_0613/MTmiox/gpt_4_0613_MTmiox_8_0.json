If we combine these two statements, we can infer that if the sprocket was not daggled, then it could not have been cranked. Since it's possible the sprocket was not daggled, it's also possible the sprocket was not cranked. However, this does not definitively prove that the sprocket was not cranked, because it's also possible the sprocket was both cranked and daggled. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the sprocket was not cranked based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
