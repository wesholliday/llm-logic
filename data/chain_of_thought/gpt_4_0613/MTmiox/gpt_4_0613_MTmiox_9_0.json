The second statement tells us that if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished. \n\nIf the twonk was plinked, then according to the second statement, it must have been varnished. But the first statement tells us that the twonk might not have been varnished. This means that there is a possibility that the twonk was not plinked. \n\nHowever, the word 'might' in the first statement introduces a level of uncertainty. It does not definitively state that the twonk was not varnished, only that it might not have been. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the twonk was not plinked. \n\nAnswer: No",
