If we combine these two statements, we can infer that if the clug was not snugged, then it could not have been fleeked, because being fleeked requires it to have been snugged. However, the first statement only says that the clug might not have been snugged, not that it definitely wasn't. Therefore, we can't definitively infer that the clug was not fleeked. \n\nAnswer: No",
