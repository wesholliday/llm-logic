The second statement tells us that if the grommet was sploffed, then it must have plopped the frink. \n\nIf we assume that the grommet was sploffed, then according to the second statement, it must have plopped the frink. But this contradicts the first statement, which says that the grommet might not have plopped the frink. \n\nTherefore, to avoid this contradiction, we must infer that the grommet was not sploffed. \n\nAnswer: yes",
