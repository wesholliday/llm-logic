If we combine these two statements, we can infer that if the flug was not zimmed, then it could not have been blummed, because being blummed would require it to have been zimmed. Therefore, since the flug might not have been zimmed, it's possible that the flug was not blummed. However, this does not definitively prove that the flug was not blummed, because it's also possible that the flug was both blummed and zimmed. \n\nAnswer: No",
