It means that Jeff playing basketball is a sufficient condition for Amy playing tennis. However, it does not mean that Jeff playing basketball is a necessary condition for Amy playing tennis. Amy could have played tennis for a variety of other reasons. Therefore, even if 'Amy played tennis' is true, it does not necessarily mean that 'Jeff played basketball' is true. The truth of Amy playing tennis does not allow us to infer anything about whether Jeff played basketball or not. \n\nAnswer: no",
