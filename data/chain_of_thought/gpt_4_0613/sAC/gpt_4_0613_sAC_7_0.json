It means that Alex finishing the race is a sufficient condition for Chris finishing the race. However, it does not mean that Alex finishing the race is a necessary condition for Chris finishing the race. In other words, Chris could finish the race even if Alex did not. Therefore, even if we know that \"Chris finished the race\" is true, we cannot definitively conclude that \"Alex finished the race\" is true. \n\nAnswer: No",
