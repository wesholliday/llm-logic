            "content": "The given statements are 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim' and 'The pants were denim'. The question is asking whether it follows that 'The shirt was cotton'. This is a logical reasoning question and it's important to understand the structure of the given statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, also known as an 'if-then' statement. In this type of statement, if the first part (the 'if' part, also known as the antecedent) is true, then the second part (the 'then' part, also known as the consequent) must also be true. However, the reverse is not necessarily true. Just because the consequent is true, it doesn't mean that the antecedent is also true.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent is 'the shirt was cotton' and the consequent is 'the pants were denim'. The second statement confirms that 'the pants were denim' is true, but this doesn't necessarily mean that 'the shirt was cotton' is also true. The pants could be denim for a reason other than the shirt being cotton. Therefore, it doesn't logically follow that 'the shirt was cotton' is true just because 'the pants were denim' is true.\n\nAnswer: No",
