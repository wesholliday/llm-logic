            "content": "The logic presented in the question is an example of a logical fallacy called affirming the consequent. The first statement, 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' is a conditional statement where the doll being plastic is a sufficient condition for the truck being metal. However, it does not mean that the truck being metal is a sufficient condition for the doll being plastic. The truck could be metal for a variety of other reasons not related to the doll's material. Therefore, even though 'The truck was metal' is true, it does not necessarily mean that 'The doll was plastic' is also true. \n\nAnswer: No",
