However, the second statement does not necessarily mean that the book was written by James. It could have been written by any other author who writes mystery novels. The first statement only tells us that if James wrote the book, it would be a mystery novel, but it does not tell us that all mystery novels are written by James. Therefore, we cannot conclude that 'The book was written by James' is true based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
