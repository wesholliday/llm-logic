This is a question of logical implication. \n\nIn logic, the statement 'If P then Q' does not necessarily mean 'If Q then P'. In this case, 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' does not necessarily mean 'If the truck was blue, then the car was red'. The truck being blue could be due to a number of reasons not specified in the given statements. Therefore, just because the truck is blue, we cannot definitively say that the car was red. \n\nAnswer: No",
