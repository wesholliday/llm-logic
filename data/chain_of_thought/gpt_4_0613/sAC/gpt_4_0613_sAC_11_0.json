The question is asking if 'The cake was chocolate' is necessarily true based on these statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, where the cake being chocolate is a sufficient condition for the muffins being blueberry. However, it does not mean that the cake being chocolate is a necessary condition for the muffins being blueberry. In other words, the muffins could be blueberry for other reasons, not just because the cake was chocolate.\n\nThe second statement confirms that 'The muffins were blueberry' is true, but it does not provide any information about the cake.\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The cake was chocolate' is true. \n\nAnswer: No",
