It means that Tom watching football is a sufficient condition for Jen watching basketball. However, it does not mean that Tom watching football is a necessary condition for Jen watching basketball. Jen could have watched basketball for a variety of other reasons. Therefore, even if 'Jen watched basketball' is true, it does not necessarily mean that 'Tom watched football' is true. \n\nAnswer: No",
