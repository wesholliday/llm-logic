The first statement is a conditional statement, where the occurrence of Bob choosing pasta is dependent on Sue choosing pizza. However, the second statement 'Bob chose pasta' is independent and does not provide any information about Sue's choice. Therefore, even though we know that Bob chose pasta, we cannot definitively say that Sue chose pizza because the first statement only tells us what happens if Sue chooses pizza, not that she must have chosen pizza if Bob chose pasta. \n\nAnswer: No",
