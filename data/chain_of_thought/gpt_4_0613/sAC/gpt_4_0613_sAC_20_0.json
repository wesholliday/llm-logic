The first statement is a conditional statement, where the apple being red is a sufficient condition for the banana being yellow. However, it does not mean that the banana being yellow is a sufficient condition for the apple being red. The banana could be yellow for other reasons not related to the apple's color. Therefore, even though the banana was yellow, we cannot definitively conclude that the apple was red. \n\nAnswer: no",
