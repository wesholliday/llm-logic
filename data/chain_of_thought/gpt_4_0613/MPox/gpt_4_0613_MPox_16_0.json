If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, where the first part (the sneg was crampled) is the condition and the second part (the sneg sproted the frink) is the result. According to the rules of logic, if the condition is true, then the result is also true. \n\nSince the first statement confirms that the condition (the sneg was crampled) is true, we can infer that the result (the sneg sproted the frink) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
