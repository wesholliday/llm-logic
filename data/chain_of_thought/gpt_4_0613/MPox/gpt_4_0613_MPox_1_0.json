This means that if the condition (the flugel was blimmed) is true, then the result (the flugel was zargled) must also be true. Since the first statement confirms that the condition is true (the flugel was indeed blimmed), we can infer that the result is also true. Therefore, we can infer that 'The flugel was zargled'. \n\nAnswer: yes",
