This means that if the first part of the statement (the flob was skizzled) is true, then the second part of the statement (the flob movated) must also be true. Since the first statement confirms that the flob was indeed skizzled, we can infer from the conditional statement that the flob must have movated. \n\nAnswer: yes",
