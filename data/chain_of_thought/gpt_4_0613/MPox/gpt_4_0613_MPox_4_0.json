The second statement is a conditional statement that says 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked'. This means that if the first part of the statement (the fribble was snurgled) is true, then the second part of the statement (the fribble crinked) must also be true. Since the first statement confirms that the fribble was indeed snurgled, we can infer from the conditional statement that the fribble must have crinked. \n\nAnswer: yes",
