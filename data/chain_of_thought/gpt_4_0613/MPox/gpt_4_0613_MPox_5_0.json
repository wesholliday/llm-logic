The second statement is a conditional statement that says 'If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled'. This means that being 'fraggled' is a sufficient condition for being 'smoogled'. Since we know from the first statement that the zinger was indeed 'fraggled', we can infer from the conditional statement that the zinger must also have been 'smoogled'. \n\nAnswer: yes",
