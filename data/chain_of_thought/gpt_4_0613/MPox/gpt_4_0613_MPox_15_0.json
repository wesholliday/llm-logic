The second statement is a conditional statement that says 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened'. Since the condition of the second statement is met by the first statement, we can infer the result of the second statement. Therefore, we can infer 'The dreb was spened'. \n\nAnswer: yes",
