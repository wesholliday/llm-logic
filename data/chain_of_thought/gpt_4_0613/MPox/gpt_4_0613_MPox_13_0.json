This means that if the first part of the statement (the glip was slogged) is true, then the second part of the statement (the glip was tragged) must also be true. Since we know from the first statement that 'The glip was slogged' is true, we can infer that 'The glip was tragged' is also true. \n\nAnswer: yes",
