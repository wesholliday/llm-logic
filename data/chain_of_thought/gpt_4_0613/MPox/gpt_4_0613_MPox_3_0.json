The second statement is a conditional statement, 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked'. This means that if the first part of the statement (the splat was morphed) is true, then the second part of the statement (the splat quanked) must also be true. Since we know from the first statement that 'The splat was morphed' is true, we can infer that 'The splat quanked' is also true. \n\nAnswer: yes",
