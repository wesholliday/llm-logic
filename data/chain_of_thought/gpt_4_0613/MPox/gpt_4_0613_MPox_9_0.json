The condition for the twonk to be varnished is that it was plinked. Since the first statement confirms that the twonk was indeed plinked, we can infer from the second statement that it was also varnished. This is a basic example of modus ponens, a valid form of argument in logic. Therefore, we can infer 'It was varnished'. \n\nAnswer: yes",
