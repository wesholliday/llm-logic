The second statement is a conditional statement, where the presence of the wolf in the den is dependent on the bear being in the cave. However, the presence of the bear in the cave is not dependent on the wolf being in the den. Therefore, even though we know that the wolf was in the den, we cannot infer from these statements that the bear was in the cave. The bear could be in the cave or not, the statements do not provide enough information to determine this. \n\nAnswer: No",
