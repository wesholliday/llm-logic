It tells us that if a certain condition is met (Ben eating pasta), then a certain outcome will occur (Kate eating salad). However, it does not tell us that the only way for Kate to eat salad is if Ben eats pasta. In other words, Kate eating salad does not necessarily mean that Ben ate pasta. Therefore, from the information given, we cannot infer that Ben ate pasta. \n\nAnswer: no",
