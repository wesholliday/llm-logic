The second statement is a conditional statement, where the presence of the dog inside leads to the conclusion that the cat is outside. However, the fact that the cat is outside does not necessarily mean that the dog is inside. The cat could be outside for a variety of reasons unrelated to the location of the dog. Therefore, from these statements, we cannot infer that the dog was inside. \n\nAnswer: no",
