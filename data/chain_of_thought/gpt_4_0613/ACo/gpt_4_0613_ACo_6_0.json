The second statement is a conditional statement that says 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta'. While we know that 'Bob chose pasta', this does not necessarily mean that 'Sue chose pizza'. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if Sue chose pizza, not that she definitely did. It's possible that Bob could have chosen pasta even if Sue did not choose pizza. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'Sue chose pizza' based on the given information. \n\nAnswer: no",
