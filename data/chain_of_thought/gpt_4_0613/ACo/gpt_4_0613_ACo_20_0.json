The second statement is a conditional statement, where the condition is 'the apple was red' and the result is 'the banana was yellow'. \n\nHowever, knowing that 'the banana was yellow' does not necessarily mean that 'the apple was red'. The banana could be yellow for other reasons, not necessarily because the apple was red. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if the apple is red, not what happens if the banana is yellow. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that 'The apple was red' from the given statements. \n\nAnswer: No",
