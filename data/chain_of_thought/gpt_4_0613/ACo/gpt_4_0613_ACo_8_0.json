The second statement is a conditional statement, where the condition is 'the vampire was awake' and the result is 'the mummy was awake'. However, knowing that the mummy was awake does not necessarily mean that the vampire was awake. The mummy could be awake for other reasons not related to the vampire's state of wakefulness. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The vampire was awake' based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
