The second statement is a conditional statement, where the presence of the griffin in the forest implies the presence of the unicorn in the forest. However, the presence of the unicorn in the forest does not necessarily imply the presence of the griffin in the forest. The first statement confirms that the unicorn was in the forest, but it does not provide any information about the griffin. Therefore, we cannot infer from these two statements that 'The griffin was in the forest'. \n\nAnswer: No",
