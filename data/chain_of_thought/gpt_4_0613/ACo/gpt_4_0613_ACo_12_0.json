It tells us that if a certain condition is met (Joe going to the park), then a certain outcome will occur (Lucy going to the zoo). However, it does not tell us that the reverse is true. In other words, just because Lucy went to the zoo, we cannot infer that Joe went to the park. The condition (Joe going to the park) is not the only way for the outcome (Lucy going to the zoo) to occur. Lucy could have gone to the zoo for a variety of reasons unrelated to Joe's actions. Therefore, we cannot infer that Joe went to the park just because Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: no",
