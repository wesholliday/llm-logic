The second statement is a conditional statement that says 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'. However, this does not mean that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic. This is a common logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. The truth of the truck being metal does not guarantee the truth of the doll being plastic. The doll could be made of any material. The statements do not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion about the material of the doll. \n\nAnswer: No",
