The second statement is a conditional statement, where the presence of a cotton shirt guarantees that the pants are denim. However, the reverse is not necessarily true. Just because the pants are denim, it does not guarantee that the shirt was cotton. The shirt could be of any material. Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer that 'The shirt was cotton'. \n\nAnswer: no",
