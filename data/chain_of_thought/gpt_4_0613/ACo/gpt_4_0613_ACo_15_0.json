It tells us what happens if a certain condition is met, in this case, if Sam took a plane. However, it does not tell us what happens if the condition is not met. We know that Erin took a train, but this does not necessarily mean that Sam took a plane. Sam could have taken a plane, or he could have taken a bus, a car, or any other form of transportation. The statement does not provide enough information to infer that Sam took a plane. \n\nAnswer: no",
