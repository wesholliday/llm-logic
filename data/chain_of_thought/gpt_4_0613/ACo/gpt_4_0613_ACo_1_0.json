The second statement is a conditional statement, where Sue's presence at the wedding is dependent on Mary's presence. However, the first statement confirms that Sue was at the wedding. This does not necessarily mean that Mary was at the wedding. The conditional statement only tells us that if Mary was there, then Sue was definitely there. But it doesn't tell us that if Sue was there, then Mary was definitely there. Therefore, we cannot infer from these statements that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
