The second statement is a conditional statement, where the robot visiting Jupiter is a consequence of the alien visiting Mars. However, the fact that the robot visited Jupiter does not necessarily mean that the alien visited Mars. The robot could have visited Jupiter for a different reason. Therefore, we cannot infer from these statements that 'The alien visited Mars'. \n\nAnswer: No",
