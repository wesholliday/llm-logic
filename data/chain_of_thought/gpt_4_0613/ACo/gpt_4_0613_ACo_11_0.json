The second statement is a conditional statement, where the presence of a chocolate cake implies the presence of blueberry muffins. However, the presence of blueberry muffins does not necessarily imply the presence of a chocolate cake. This is because the muffins could be blueberry even if the cake is not chocolate. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The cake was chocolate' just from the information given. \n\nAnswer: no",
