If it's possible that the wug is not garpled, and the wug must be either garpled or sproinged, then it must be the case that the wug is sproinged. This is because the second statement gives us only two options for the state of the wug, and the first statement rules out one of those options. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the wug is sproinged. \n\nAnswer: yes",
