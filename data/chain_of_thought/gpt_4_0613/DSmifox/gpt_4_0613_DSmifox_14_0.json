The second statement tells us that either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked. This is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. If it's possible for the clug to not be snugged, then in order for the disjunction to hold true, the clug must be fleeked. Therefore, we can infer that the clug is fleeked. \n\nAnswer: yes",
