If it's possible that the flug is not zimmed, and we know that it must be either zimmed or blummed, then it must be the case that the flug is blummed. This is because the second statement gives us only two options, and the first statement rules out one of those options. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
