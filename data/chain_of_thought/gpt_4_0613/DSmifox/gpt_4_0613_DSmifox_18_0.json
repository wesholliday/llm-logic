If we combine these two statements, we can infer that if the shank is not nugged, then it must be plooked. Since the first statement tells us that the shank might not be nugged, it is possible that the shank is plooked. However, the first statement does not definitively say that the shank is not nugged, only that it might not be. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the shank is plooked. \n\nAnswer: No",
