If we combine these two statements, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane. This is because if Sam did take a plane, then according to the second statement, Erin must have taken a train. But this contradicts the first statement, which says that Erin might not have taken a train. Therefore, the only way for both statements to be true is if Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
