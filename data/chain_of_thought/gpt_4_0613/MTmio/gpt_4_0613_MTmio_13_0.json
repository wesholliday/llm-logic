The second statement tells us that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. If we combine these two statements, we can infer that if the truck might not have been blue, then the car could not have been red. This is because if the car was red, then the truck would have to be blue, which contradicts the possibility that the truck might not have been blue. Therefore, we can infer that the car was not red. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
