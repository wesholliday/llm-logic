The second statement tells us that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry. If we combine these two statements, we can infer that since there is a possibility that the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake could not have been chocolate. This is because if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would have to be blueberry, which contradicts the possibility that the muffins might not have been blueberry. Therefore, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
