The second statement tells us that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have also finished the race. If we combine these two statements, we can infer that since there's a possibility that Chris did not finish the race, then Alex could not have finished the race. This is because if Alex had finished the race, then according to the second statement, Chris would have had to finish the race as well, which contradicts the possibility presented in the first statement that Chris might not have finished the race. Therefore, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race. \n\nAnswer: yes",
