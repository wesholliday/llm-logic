The second statement tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark definitely bought the blue shirt. If we combine these two statements, we can infer that since there's a possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then it must be the case that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is because if Lisa had bought the red shirt, then according to the second statement, Mark would have had to buy the blue shirt, which contradicts the possibility in the first statement that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
