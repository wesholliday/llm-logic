The second statement tells us that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest. If we combine these two statements, we can infer that since there is a possibility that the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin could not have been in the forest. This is because if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest, which contradicts the possibility that the unicorn might not have been in the forest. Therefore, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
