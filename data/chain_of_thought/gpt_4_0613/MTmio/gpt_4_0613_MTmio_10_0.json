The second statement tells us that if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside. If we combine these two statements, we can infer that if the cat might not have been outside, then the dog could not have been inside. This is because if the dog was inside, then according to the second statement, the cat must have been outside, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that the dog was not inside. \n\nAnswer: yes",
