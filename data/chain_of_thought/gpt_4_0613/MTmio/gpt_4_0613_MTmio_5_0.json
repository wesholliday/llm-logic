The second statement, \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis,\" implies that Amy playing tennis is a necessary condition for Jeff having played basketball. \n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can infer that if there is a possibility that Amy did not play tennis, then there is a possibility that Jeff did not play basketball. However, this does not necessarily mean that Jeff did not play basketball. It only suggests a possibility. \n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"Jeff did not play basketball\" from these two statements. \n\nAnswer: No",
