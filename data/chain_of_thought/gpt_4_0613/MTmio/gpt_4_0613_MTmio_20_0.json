If we combine these two statements, we can infer that if the banana was not yellow, then the apple could not have been red. This is because the second statement establishes a condition where the apple being red necessitates the banana being yellow. If the banana was not yellow, this condition could not have been met, meaning the apple could not have been red. Therefore, we can infer that the apple was not red. \n\nAnswer: yes",
