The second statement tells us that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy definitely went to the zoo. If we combine these two statements, we can infer that since there is a possibility that Lucy did not go to the zoo, then it must be possible that Joe did not go to the park. This is because if Joe did go to the park, then Lucy would have had to go to the zoo, which contradicts the possibility that she might not have gone. Therefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
