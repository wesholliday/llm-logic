The second statement tells us that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. If we combine these two statements, we can infer that since there is a possibility that the wolf was not in the den, then the condition for the bear to be in the cave (which is the wolf being in the den) was not met. Therefore, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
