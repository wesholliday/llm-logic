If we combine these two statements, we can infer that since there's a possibility that Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue could not have chosen pizza. This is because if Sue had chosen pizza, then Bob would have had to choose pasta, which contradicts the possibility that Bob might not have chosen pasta. Therefore, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza. \n\nAnswer: yes",
