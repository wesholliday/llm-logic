The second statement tells us that if Tom watched football, then Jen definitely watched basketball. \n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can infer that since there's a possibility that Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom could not have watched football. This is because if Tom had watched football, then according to the second statement, Jen must have watched basketball, which contradicts the possibility presented in the first statement.\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements, we can infer that Tom did not watch football. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
