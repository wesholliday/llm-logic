The second statement tells us that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. If we combine these two statements, we can infer that the doll could not have been plastic. This is because if the doll was plastic, then the truck would have to be metal, which contradicts the possibility that the truck might not have been metal. Therefore, the doll could not have been plastic. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
