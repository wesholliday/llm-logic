The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities, stating that the splat is not quanked. Given that these are the only two possibilities presented for the state of the splat, if it is not quanked, it must be morphed. Therefore, we can infer from these two statements that the splat is morphed. \n\nAnswer: yes",
