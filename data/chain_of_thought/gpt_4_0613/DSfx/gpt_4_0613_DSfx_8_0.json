The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities, stating that the sprocket is not daggled. Given that these are the only two options presented for the state of the sprocket, if it is not daggled, it must be cranked. Therefore, we can infer from these two statements that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
