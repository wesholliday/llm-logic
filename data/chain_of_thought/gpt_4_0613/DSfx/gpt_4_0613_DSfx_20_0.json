This is an example of a disjunction in logic, where at least one of the conditions must be true. The second statement tells us that the fleeg is not surned. Given these two pieces of information, we can infer that the only remaining possibility for the state of the fleeg is that it is bluttered. This is because in a disjunction, if one condition is false, the other must be true. Therefore, we can infer that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
