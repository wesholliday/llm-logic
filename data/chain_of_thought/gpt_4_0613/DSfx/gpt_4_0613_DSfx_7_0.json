The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities, stating that the whiffle is not tinked. Given that these are the only two possibilities presented for the state of the whiffle, if it is not tinked, it must be shanked. Therefore, we can infer from these two statements that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
