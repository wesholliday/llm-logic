The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities, stating that the wug is not garpled. Given that these are the only two options presented for the state of the wug, if it is not garpled, it must be sproinged. Therefore, we can infer from these two statements that the wug is sproinged. \n\nAnswer: yes",
