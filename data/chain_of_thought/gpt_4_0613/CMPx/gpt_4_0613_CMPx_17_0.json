    "user_prompt": "Suppose a flinker, a dringen, and a n\u00fcffen have the best projections to have a breakout season next year. Talent scouts believe it's highly probable the flinker will have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen, while the n\u00fcffen is an outside shot. Since these are the only top prospects, if the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. Moreover, scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season and hence the dringen likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will?",

            "content": "The question states that if the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. This means that if both the dringen and the flinker don't have breakout seasons, the n\u00fcffen will. The question also states that scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season and hence the dringen likely won't. This means that it's likely that the dringen won't have a breakout season. \n\nGiven these conditions, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, it's likely that the n\u00fcffen will, because it's likely that the dringen won't have a breakout season (since the flinker is likely to have one). So, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, it's likely that the conditions for the n\u00fcffen to have a breakout season (i.e., neither the dringen nor the flinker having a breakout season) will be met.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
