    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a garplex, a beelhet, and a peedonk are competing to be domer of the year. Experts think the garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, with the peedonk having a much lower chance. Since these are the only domer candidates, if the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer. Moreover, it is likely the garplex will become domer and hence the beelhet likely won\u2019t become domer. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will?",

            "content": "The question is asking if it's likely that the peedonk will become the domer if the garplex doesn't. The information given states that the garplex is most likely to win, followed by the beelhet, and the peedonk has the lowest chance. It also states that if the beelhet doesn't win and the garplex doesn't win, then the peedonk will win. However, it also states that it's likely the garplex will win and hence the beelhet likely won't win. This means that if the garplex doesn't win, the beelhet, who is the second most likely to win, is also unlikely to win. Therefore, if both the garplex and the beelhet don't win, the peedonk will win. So, it does follow that if the garplex doesn't become the domer, it's likely the peedonk will.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
