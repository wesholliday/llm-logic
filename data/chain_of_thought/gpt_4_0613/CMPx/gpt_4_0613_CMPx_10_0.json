    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantole, a dribban, and a cruggit are the most downloaded fillip apps this month. Market watchers expect the fantole likely will retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit download rate significantly lower. These lead the downloads, so if the dribban isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn\u2019t, the cruggit will be. Moreover, the fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fantole isn\u2019t the most downloaded, the cruggit will be?",

            "content": "The question states that if the dribban isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn\u2019t, the cruggit will be. This means that if the fantole and dribban are not the most downloaded, then the cruggit will be the most downloaded. The question also states that the fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won\u2019t. This means that the dribban is not likely to be the most downloaded. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, the cruggit will be. The cruggit's download rate is significantly lower than both the fantole and the dribban, so even if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, it doesn't necessarily mean that the cruggit will be the most downloaded. It could be that another app, not mentioned in the question, becomes the most downloaded. Therefore, it does not follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fantole isn\u2019t the most downloaded, the cruggit will be.\n\nAnswer: No",
