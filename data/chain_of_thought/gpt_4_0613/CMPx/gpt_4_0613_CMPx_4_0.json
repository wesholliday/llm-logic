    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crinel, a nafiz, and a tomul are competing to be snarggle of next year's laggle team. The crinel is considered the frontrunner for snarggle, followed by the nafiz, while the tomul is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates, if the nafiz isn\u2019t named snarggle, then if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle. Moreover, the crinel likely will be named snarggle and hence the nafiz likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be?",

            "content": "The question is asking if it is likely that the tomul will be named snarggle if the crinel isn't. From the information given, we know that the crinel is the most likely to be named snarggle, followed by the nafiz, and then the tomul. We also know that if the nafiz isn't named snarggle, and if the crinel isn't named snarggle, then the tomul will be named snarggle. However, the likelihood of the tomul being named snarggle is dependent on both the crinel and the nafiz not being named snarggle. The information tells us that it is likely that the crinel will be named snarggle, and hence the nafiz likely won't be. But this doesn't necessarily mean that if the crinel isn't named snarggle, it is likely that the tomul will be. The tomul being named snarggle is still dependent on both the crinel and the nafiz not being named snarggle. So, it doesn't necessarily follow that it is likely that, if the crinel isn't named snarggle, the tomul will be.\n\nAnswer: No",
