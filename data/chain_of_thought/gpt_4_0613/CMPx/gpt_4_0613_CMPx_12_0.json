    "user_prompt": "Suppose a stribben, a vanoon, and a jentapp are applying to rent a bondle. The owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant, followed by the vanoon, while the jentapp seems much less qualified to rent a bondle. Since these are the only applicants, if the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, then if the stribben isn\u2019t selected, the jentapp will be selected. Moreover, the stribben likely will be chosen and hence the vanoon likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the stribben isn\u2019t selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be?",

The information given is that the stribben is the most likely to be chosen, followed by the vanoon, and then the jentapp. It's also stated that if the vanoon isn't selected, and if the stribben isn't selected, then the jentapp will be selected. \n\nGiven that the stribben is the most likely to be chosen, it's stated that the vanoon likely won't be chosen. If the vanoon isn't chosen, and the stribben also isn't chosen, then the jentapp will be selected. \n\nSo, if the stribben isn't selected, and we already know that the vanoon likely won't be selected, then it does follow that the jentapp will likely be selected. \n\nAnswer: Yes.",
