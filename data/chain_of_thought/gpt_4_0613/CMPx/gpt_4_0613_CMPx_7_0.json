    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crastin, a nivet, and a jomial are the top bispets this breeding season. Breeders expect the crastin likely will birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. These lead in birthing, so if the nivet doesn\u2019t birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn\u2019t, the jomial will. Moreover, the crastin likely will lead births and hence the nivet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, the jomial will?",

            "content": "The question is asking if it's likely that, if the crastin doesn't lead births, the jomial will. The information given states that the crastin is expected to birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. It also states that if the nivet doesn\u2019t birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn\u2019t, the jomial will. However, it also states that the crastin likely will lead births and hence the nivet likely won\u2019t. This means that if the crastin doesn't lead births, it's likely that the nivet will, not the jomial. The jomial is only expected to lead births if both the crastin and the nivet don't, which is not the scenario presented in the question. Therefore, it does not follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, the jomial will.\n\nAnswer: No",
