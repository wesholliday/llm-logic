    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a blimfet, a crongle, and a narzil are the leading bafwidgers. Experts expect the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most this year, followed by the crongle, with the narzil bafwidging much less. These are the only major bafwidgers, so if the crongle doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, then if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most. Moreover, the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most, and hence the crongle likely won\u2019t bafwidge the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will?",

From the information given, we know that the blimfet is expected to bafwidge the most, followed by the crongle, and then the narzil. We also know that if the crongle doesn't bafwidge the most, then if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most. However, the crongle is expected to bafwidge more than the narzil, so if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, it's more likely that the crongle will bafwidge the most, not the narzil. Therefore, it does not follow that it's likely that, if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, the narzil will.\n\nAnswer: no",
