    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a dasetil, a lentum, and a vifali are competing to be this year's batalit. The dasetil is the most likely to become the batalit, followed closely by the lentum, with the vifali trailing way behind. Since these are the only competitors, if the lentum isn\u2019t the batalit, then if the dasetil isn\u2019t the batalit, the vifali will be. Since the dasetil is ahead, the lentum most likely won\u2019t be the batalit. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the dasetil isn\u2019t the batalit, the vifali will be?",

The information given states that the dasetil is the most likely to become the batalit, followed by the lentum, and then the vifali. It also states that if the lentum isn\u2019t the batalit, then if the dasetil isn\u2019t the batalit, the vifali will be. However, it also states that since the dasetil is ahead, the lentum most likely won\u2019t be the batalit. This means that if the dasetil isn't the batalit, the lentum is the next most likely candidate, not the vifali. Therefore, it does not follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the dasetil isn\u2019t the batalit, the vifali will be.\n\nAnswer: No",
