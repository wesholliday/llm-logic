    "user_prompt": "Suppose a fantole, a dribban, and a snorpul have the best odds to win this season's Rizzle Cup. Oddsmakers believe it's most probable the fantole will capture the cup, followed by the dribban, while the snorpul is a heavy longshot. Since these are the only top contenders, if the dribban doesn\u2019t win the cup, then if the fantole doesn\u2019t win, the snorpul will win. Moreover, the fantole likely will win the cup and hence the dribban likely won't win. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will?",

            "content": "The question is asking if it's likely that the snorpul will win if the fantole doesn't win. The information given states that the fantole is most likely to win, followed by the dribban, and then the snorpul as a longshot. It also states that if the dribban doesn\u2019t win the cup, then if the fantole doesn\u2019t win, the snorpul will win. This means that if the fantole doesn't win, and the dribban also doesn't win, then the snorpul will win. However, the question also states that the fantole is likely to win, and hence the dribban likely won't win. This means that if the fantole doesn't win, it's still not likely that the snorpul will win because the dribban is still in the running and has better odds than the snorpul. \n\nAnswer: No",
