    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

            "content": "The question is asking if it's likely that the sulect will get the zulision if the jantiz doesn't get it. The information given states that the jantiz is the most qualified and likely to get the zulision, followed by the cramen, and then the sulect. It also states that if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. This means that if the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, the only other applicants are the cramen and the sulect. Since the cramen is more qualified than the sulect, it's more likely that the cramen would get the zulision if the jantiz doesn't. Therefore, it doesn't necessarily follow that it's likely that the sulect will get the zulision if the jantiz doesn't.\n\nAnswer: No",
