    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fraglen, a darpil, and a votal are the top bispil teams this season. The fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, while the votal trails far behind. These lead the league, so if the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn\u2019t, the votal will. Moreover, the fraglen likely will lead the league and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fraglen doesn\u2019t lead the league, the votal will?",

            "content": "The question is asking if it's likely that, if the fraglen doesn't lead the league, the votal will. From the information given, we know that the fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, and then the votal. We also know that if the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn\u2019t, the votal will. This means that if the fraglen doesn't lead, the only other team that could potentially lead is the votal, assuming the darpil doesn't lead. However, the information also states that the votal trails far behind, which suggests that it's not very likely for the votal to lead. Therefore, even if the fraglen doesn't lead, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's likely for the votal to lead. \n\nAnswer: No",
