    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a vringlet, a crappen, and a strorvil are shortlisted for the Liggerton Award in bloffu this year. Bloffu critics regard the vringlet as the front runner, followed by the crappen, while the strorvil is a heavy underdog. Since these are the only finalists under consideration, if the crappen doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the vringlet doesn\u2019t win, the strorvil will win. Moreover, the vringlet likely will win the award and hence the crappen likely won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the vringlet doesn\u2019t win the Liggerton Award, the strorvil will?",

Make sure not to answer with 'Answer:' until *after* you think step by step and explain your reasoning.",

            "content": "The question is asking if it is likely that the strorvil will win if the vringlet doesn't win. The information given states that if the crappen doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the vringlet doesn\u2019t win, the strorvil will win. It also states that the vringlet is likely to win, and hence the crappen likely won\u2019t win. This means that if the vringlet doesn't win, the only other option is the strorvil, because it's already been stated that the crappen likely won't win. Therefore, it is likely that if the vringlet doesn\u2019t win the Liggerton Award, the strorvil will. \n\nAnswer: yes",
