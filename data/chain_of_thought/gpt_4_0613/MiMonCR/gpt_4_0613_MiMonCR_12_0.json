This statement is composed of two parts: \"The weather might be unpredictable\" and \"affect travel plans\". The conjunction \"and\" links these two parts, implying that both can occur. Therefore, if the weather is unpredictable, it might affect travel plans. So, from the original statement, we can infer that \"The weather might affect travel plans\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
