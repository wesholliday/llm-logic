This means that there are two possibilities for the performance: it might be improvised, and it might feature guest artists. These two possibilities are not necessarily dependent on each other. Therefore, even if we remove the part about the performance possibly being improvised, the possibility of the performance featuring guest artists still stands.\n\nAnswer: yes",
