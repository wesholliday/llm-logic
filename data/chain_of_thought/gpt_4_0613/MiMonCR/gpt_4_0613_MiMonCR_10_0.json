This implies that there is a chance that the athlete might not be able to compete, regardless of the reason. Therefore, the statement 'The athlete might be unable to compete' can be inferred from the original statement, as it is a broader statement that includes the possibility of the athlete being unable to compete due to injury among other potential reasons.\n\nAnswer: yes",
