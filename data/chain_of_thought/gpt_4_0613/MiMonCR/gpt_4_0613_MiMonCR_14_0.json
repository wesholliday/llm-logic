This means that there are two possibilities for the meeting: it could be confidential, and it could involve important decisions. The second statement is asking if we can infer from the first statement that the meeting might involve important decisions. Since the possibility of the meeting involving important decisions is explicitly mentioned in the first statement, we can infer this in the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
