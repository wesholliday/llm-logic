            "content": "The argument's premise is 'If directions were provided, then they were not explained clearly'. This means that whenever directions are provided, they are not explained clearly. \n\nThe conclusion is 'If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided'. This means that whenever directions are explained clearly, they were not provided. \n\nThe premise and the conclusion are contrapositives of each other. In logic, if a statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then swapping them. \n\nIn this case, the premise is 'If P, then not Q' and the conclusion is 'If Q, then not P'. These are contrapositives of each other. Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true. \n\nSo, the form of argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
