This means that any advice given was not helpful. \n\nThe conclusion is 'If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered'. This is a contradiction because it's impossible for helpful advice to be offered and for advice not to be offered at the same time. \n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion contradicts the premise. \n\nAnswer: No",
