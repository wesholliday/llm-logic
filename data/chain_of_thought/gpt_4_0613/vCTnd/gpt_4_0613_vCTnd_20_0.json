This means that any recommendation that was made was not strong. \n\nThe conclusion is 'If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made'. This means that if a recommendation was strong, then it was not made. \n\nThe premise and the conclusion are logically equivalent. They both express the same idea, but in different ways. The premise says that if a recommendation was made, it was not strong. The conclusion says that if a recommendation was strong, it was not made. Both statements express the idea that a recommendation cannot be both made and strong at the same time. \n\nTherefore, the form of argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows logically from the premise. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
