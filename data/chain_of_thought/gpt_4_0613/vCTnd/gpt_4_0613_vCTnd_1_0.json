The premise is 'If it's raining, then it's not raining hard'. This means that the condition of it raining does not allow for it to be raining hard. \n\nThe conclusion is 'If it's raining hard, then it's not raining'. This is a contradiction to the premise. If it's raining hard, it's still raining, just at a higher intensity. \n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion contradicts the premise. \n\nAnswer: No",
