This implies that the act of washing the clothes was not done properly. \n\nThe conclusion is 'If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed'. This implies that if the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed at all. \n\nThe premise and the conclusion contradict each other. If the clothes were washed (even if not properly), it means they were washed. The conclusion, however, states that if they were washed properly, they were not washed at all. This is a contradiction. \n\nTherefore, the form of argument is not logically valid because the conclusion contradicts the premise. \n\nAnswer: No",
