This means that every time instructions were given, they were not explained clearly. \n\nThe conclusion is 'If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given'. This means that every time instructions were explained clearly, they were not given. \n\nThe premise and the conclusion are contrapositives of each other. In logic, if a statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then swapping them. \n\nIn this case, the premise is 'If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given', which is the conclusion of the argument. \n\nTherefore, the form of argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
