This implies that any exercise Alex did was not substantial or intense. \n\nThe conclusion is 'If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise'. This is a contradiction because if Alex exercised much, then he did exercise. \n\nThe conclusion contradicts the premise. In logic, a valid argument is one where if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In this case, the conclusion contradicts the premise, so the argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
