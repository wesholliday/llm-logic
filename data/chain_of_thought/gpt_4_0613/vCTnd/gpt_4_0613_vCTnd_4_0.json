This means that studying and studying diligently are mutually exclusive for Ben - he cannot do both at the same time. \n\nThe conclusion is 'If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study'. This is the reverse of the premise. If the premise is true, then the conclusion cannot be true because it contradicts the premise. \n\nIn other words, if it's true that when Ben studies, he does not study diligently, then it cannot also be true that when Ben studies diligently, he does not study. These two statements are logically inconsistent with each other. \n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
