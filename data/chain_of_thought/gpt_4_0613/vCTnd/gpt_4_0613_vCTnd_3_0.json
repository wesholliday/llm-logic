The premise 'If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal' implies that eating a meal and eating a large meal are mutually exclusive - that is, if one happens, the other cannot. However, the conclusion 'If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal' contradicts this, as it implies that eating a large meal and eating a meal are not mutually exclusive, but rather that one implies the other. This is a contradiction, and therefore the argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
