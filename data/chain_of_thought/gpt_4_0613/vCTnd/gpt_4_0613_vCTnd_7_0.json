            "content": "The argument's premise is 'If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly'. This means that being served and being served promptly are mutually exclusive events - if one happens, the other cannot.\n\nThe conclusion is 'If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served'. This is the contrapositive of the premise. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of a statement 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'. \n\nIn this case, P is 'the customer was served' and Q is 'he was not served promptly'. So, the contrapositive of the premise 'If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly' is 'If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served', which is exactly the conclusion of the argument.\n\nTherefore, the form of argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
