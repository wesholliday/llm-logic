This implies that a thorough cleaning did not occur even though some cleaning did. \n\nThe conclusion is 'If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned'. This is suggesting that if a thorough cleaning occurred, then no cleaning occurred at all. \n\nThese two statements are contradictory. The premise suggests that some cleaning can occur without it being thorough, while the conclusion suggests that a thorough cleaning cannot occur without negating the fact that any cleaning occurred. \n\nTherefore, the form of this argument is not logically valid because the conclusion contradicts the premise. \n\nAnswer: No",
