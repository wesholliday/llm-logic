The conclusion is 'If Jane studied long, then she did not study'. This is contradictory because if Jane studied long, it means she did study. Therefore, the conclusion contradicts the premise. \n\nIn terms of logical validity, an argument is valid if the truth of the premises logically guarantees the truth of the conclusion. In this case, the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion, because the conclusion contradicts the premise. Therefore, this form of argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
