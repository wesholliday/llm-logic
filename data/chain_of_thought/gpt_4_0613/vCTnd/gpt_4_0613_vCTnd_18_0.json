This implies that any discussion of the issue was not in depth. \n\nThe conclusion is 'If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed'. This is a contradiction to the premise. If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was indeed discussed, just not in a superficial manner. \n\nTherefore, the form of argument is not logically valid because the conclusion contradicts the premise. \n\nAnswer: No",
