This means that it is not a certainty that the splat was morphed. \n\nOn the other hand, the statement 'It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed' implies that it is not necessary or obligatory for the splat to have been morphed. This means that there is a possibility that the splat was not morphed.\n\nTherefore, the inference from 'The splat might not have been morphed' to 'It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed' is valid because both statements express the same possibility that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
