This means that it is not a certainty that the flugel was blimmed. If it's not a certainty, then it's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed. 'Must' implies a necessity or a certainty, which is not present in the original statement. Therefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed' from 'The flugel might not have been blimmed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
