This means that it is not certain or necessary that the wug was flooped. Therefore, it is correct to infer 'It's not the case that the wug must have been flooped' from the original statement. This is because the word 'must' implies necessity or certainty, which is contradicted by the possibility that the wug was not flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
