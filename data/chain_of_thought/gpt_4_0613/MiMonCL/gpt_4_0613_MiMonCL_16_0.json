The second part of the statement (it might be worth millions) is contingent on the first part (it might be authentic). Therefore, if we know the entire statement is true, we can infer that the first part of the statement (The artwork might be authentic) is also true, because it is a part of the whole statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
