The two possibilities are connected by the conjunction 'and', which means both can be true at the same time. Therefore, if we know that 'The experiment might be successful and yield groundbreaking results', we can infer that 'The experiment might be successful' because it is part of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
