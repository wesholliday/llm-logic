            "content": "Explanation: The original statement says \"The contract might be legally binding and have hidden clauses\". This statement is composed of two parts: \"The contract might be legally binding\" and \"have hidden clauses\". The use of \"and\" in the sentence means both parts are connected but can also stand independently. Therefore, even if we remove the second part about hidden clauses, the first part about the contract possibly being legally binding still holds true. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
