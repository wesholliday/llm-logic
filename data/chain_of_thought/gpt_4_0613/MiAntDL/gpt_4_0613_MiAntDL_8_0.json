The first possibility is that the restaurant might be closed, and the second is that it might be open for limited hours. Therefore, the inference that 'The restaurant might be closed on Mondays' is a valid one, as it is one of the possibilities explicitly mentioned in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
