This is an example of a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the conditions must be true. However, it does not specify that both conditions cannot be true at the same time. Therefore, while it is possible that the floob is on the quibble, it is not a necessary conclusion from the original statement. The floob could also just be in the bimboozle.\n\nAnswer: no",
