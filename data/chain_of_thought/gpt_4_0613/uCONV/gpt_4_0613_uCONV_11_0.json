However, this does not necessarily mean that every time the muffins are blueberry, the cake is chocolate. The muffins could be blueberry even if the cake is not chocolate. The statement does not provide enough information to make that inference. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate. \n\nAnswer: No",
