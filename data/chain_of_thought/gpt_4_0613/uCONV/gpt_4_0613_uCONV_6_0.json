This is because the statement is not bi-directional. It only indicates what Bob would choose if Sue chose pizza, but it does not indicate what Sue would choose if Bob chose pasta. Sue could choose something else even if Bob chose pasta. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza. \n\nAnswer: No",
