The original statement only tells us what happens when Sam takes a plane, not what happens when Erin takes a train. It's possible that Erin could take a train without Sam taking a plane. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
