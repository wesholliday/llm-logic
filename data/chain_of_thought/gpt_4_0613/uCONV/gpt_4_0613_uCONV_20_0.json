It does not establish the reverse: that if the banana is yellow, then the apple must be red. It's possible for the banana to be yellow without the apple being red. For example, the apple could be green while the banana is yellow. The initial statement does not exclude this possibility. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red. \n\nAnswer: no",
