It does not establish the reverse relationship. It's possible that the truck could be metal while the doll is not plastic. The truck being metal could be due to other reasons not related to the doll's material. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic. \n\nAnswer: no",
