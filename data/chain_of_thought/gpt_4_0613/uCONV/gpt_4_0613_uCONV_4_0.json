However, it does not tell us that the only way the robot could have visited Jupiter is if the alien visited Mars. In other words, the robot could have visited Jupiter for other reasons unrelated to the alien's visit to Mars. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars. This would be a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. \n\nAnswer: No",
