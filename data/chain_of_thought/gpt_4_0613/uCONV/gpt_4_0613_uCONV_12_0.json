However, it does not necessarily mean that Lucy going to the zoo is a sufficient condition for Joe going to the park. In other words, Lucy could go to the zoo for reasons other than Joe going to the park. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park. \n\nAnswer: No",
