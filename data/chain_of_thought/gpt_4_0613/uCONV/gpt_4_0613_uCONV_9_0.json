However, this statement does not necessarily imply the converse, which is \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\" The original statement does not provide information about what happens when Mark buys the blue shirt. It's possible that Mark could buy the blue shirt regardless of whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
