However, this does not necessarily mean that every time the pants were denim, the shirt was cotton. The pants could be denim with a shirt of a different material. The statement does not provide enough information to make that inference. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton. \n\nAnswer: no",
