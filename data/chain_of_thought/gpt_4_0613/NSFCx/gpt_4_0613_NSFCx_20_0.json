            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence states that the wozzle might gribble floob or gribble wumble. The use of the word 'or' indicates that the wozzle might do one action or the other, but not necessarily both. However, the word 'might' implies possibility, not certainty. Therefore, it is possible that the wozzle could gribble both floob and wumble, even though the original sentence does not guarantee this. The proposed inference is therefore logically valid, because it does not contradict the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
