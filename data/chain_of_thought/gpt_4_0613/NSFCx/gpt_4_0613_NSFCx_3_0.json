The use of the word 'or' indicates that the quork could be in one place or the other, but not necessarily both at the same time. The proposed inference, however, uses the word 'and', suggesting that the quork could be in both places at the same time. This is not a valid inference based on the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: no",
