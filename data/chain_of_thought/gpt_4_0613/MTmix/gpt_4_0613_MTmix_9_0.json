This means that being plinked necessitates being varnished. \n\nThe second statement introduces a possibility: the twonk might not have been varnished. This does not definitively state that the twonk was not varnished, only that it's a possibility. \n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that the twonk was not plinked. The second statement does not contradict the first one, it only introduces a possibility. If the twonk was not varnished, then it could not have been plinked. But since we only know that it might not have been varnished, we cannot definitively say that it was not plinked. \n\nAnswer: No",
