This means that snurgling the fribble will always result in it crinking. \n\nThe second statement introduces a possibility: the fribble might not have crinked. This means that it's possible that the fribble did not crink. \n\nGiven these two statements, if the fribble did not crink, then it could not have been snurgled, because snurgling always results in crinking. Therefore, if it's possible that the fribble did not crink, then it's possible that the fribble was not snurgled. \n\nHowever, the second statement does not definitively say that the fribble did not crink, only that it might not have. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the fribble was not snurgled. \n\nAnswer: No",
