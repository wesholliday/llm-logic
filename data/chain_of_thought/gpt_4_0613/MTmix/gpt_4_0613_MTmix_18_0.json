This means that being plooked necessitates being nugged. \n\nThe second statement introduces a possibility: the shank might not have been nugged. This does not definitively state that the shank was not nugged, only that it's a possibility. \n\nHowever, if we consider the possibility that the shank was not nugged, then according to the first statement, it could not have been plooked. This is because being plooked requires being nugged, and if it's possible that the shank was not nugged, then it's also possible that it was not plooked. \n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shank was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
