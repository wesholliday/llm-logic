This means that flooping always leads to bimming the zoint. \n\nThe second statement introduces a possibility: the wug might not have bimmed the zoint. \n\nIf we combine these two pieces of information, we can infer that if the wug did not bim the zoint, then it could not have been flooped, because flooping always leads to bimming the zoint. \n\nHowever, the second statement does not definitively say that the wug did not bim the zoint, only that it might not have. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the wug was not flooped. \n\nAnswer: No",
