This means that crampling the sneg always results in the sneg sproting the frink. \n\nThe second statement introduces a possibility: the sneg might not have sproted the frink. This means that it's possible that the sneg did not sprot the frink.\n\nGiven these two statements, if the sneg did not sprot the frink, then it could not have been crampled, because crampling the sneg always results in the sneg sproting the frink. Therefore, if it's possible that the sneg did not sprot the frink, it's also possible that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
