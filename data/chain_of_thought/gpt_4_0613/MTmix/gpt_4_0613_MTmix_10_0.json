This means that being sproinged necessitates being garpled. \n\nThe second statement introduces a possibility: it might not have been garpled. This does not definitively state that the wug was not garpled, only that it's possible. \n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that the wug was not sproinged. The second statement does not contradict the first, it only introduces a possibility. If it had said 'It was not garpled', then we could infer that the wug was not sproinged, because being sproinged necessitates being garpled. But as it stands, the possibility that it might not have been garpled does not exclude the possibility that it was sproinged. \n\nAnswer: No",
