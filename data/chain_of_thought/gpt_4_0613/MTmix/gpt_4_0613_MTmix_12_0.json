This means that shripping necessarily leads to lupping the zoint. \n\nThe second statement introduces a possibility: the smip might not have lupped the zoint. This means that it's possible that the smip did not lup the zoint.\n\nIf we combine these two pieces of information, we can infer that if the smip did not lup the zoint, then it could not have been shripped, because being shripped necessarily leads to lupping the zoint. Therefore, if it's possible that the smip did not lup the zoint, it must also be possible that the smip was not shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
