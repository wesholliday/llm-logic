This means that skizzling the flob will always result in the flob movating. \n\nThe second statement introduces a possibility: the flob might not have movated. This does not definitively state that the flob did not movate, only that it's possible it did not.\n\nIf we know for certain that the flob did not movate, then we could infer that the flob was not skizzled, because skizzling always results in movating. However, because the second statement only introduces a possibility and not a certainty, we cannot definitively infer that the flob was not skizzled. \n\nAnswer: No",
