This means that slogging necessarily leads to tragging. \n\nThe second statement introduces a possibility: the glip might not have tragged. This means that it's possible that the glip did not trag.\n\nIf slogging always leads to tragging, and it's possible that the glip did not trag, then it's possible that the glip was not slogged. If the glip had been slogged, it would have had to trag, according to the first statement. But since it might not have tragged, it might not have been slogged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
