This means that cranking the sprocket necessarily leads to it being daggled. \n\nThe second statement introduces a possibility: the sprocket might not have been daggled. This does not definitively state that the sprocket was not daggled, only that it's possible it wasn't.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that the sprocket was not cranked. The second statement only introduces a possibility, not a certainty. If it had said 'The sprocket was not daggled', then we could infer that the sprocket was not cranked, because cranking leads to dagglings. But as it stands, we cannot make that inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
