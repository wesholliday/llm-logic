This means that sploffing the grommet guarantees that it plopped the frink. \n\nThe second statement introduces a possibility: the grommet might not have plopped the frink. This means that it's possible that the grommet did not plop the frink.\n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can infer that if it's possible that the grommet did not plop the frink, then it must not have been sploffed. This is because, according to the first statement, if it had been sploffed, it would have definitely plopped the frink. \n\nSo, if there's a chance that it didn't plop the frink, then it couldn't have been sploffed. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
