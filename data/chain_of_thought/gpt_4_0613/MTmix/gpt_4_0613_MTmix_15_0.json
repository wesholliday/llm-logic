This means that vroombing the dreb necessarily leads to it being spened. \n\nThe second statement introduces a possibility: the dreb might not have been spened. \n\nIf we know that vroombing the dreb always results in it being spened, and we also know that there's a chance the dreb was not spened, then we can infer that there's a chance the dreb was not vroombed. If it had been vroombed, it would have been spened, but since it might not have been spened, it might not have been vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
