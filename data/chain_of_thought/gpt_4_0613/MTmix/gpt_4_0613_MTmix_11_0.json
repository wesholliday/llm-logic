If a flug is blummed, it has to be zimmed.\n\nThe second statement introduces a possibility: the flug might not have been zimmed. This means that it's possible that the necessary condition for being blummed (being zimmed) was not met.\n\nIf it's possible that the necessary condition for being blummed was not met, then it's possible that the flug was not blummed. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the flug was definitely not blummed. It's still possible that the flug was blummed and zimmed, because the second statement only introduces a possibility, not a certainty.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer from these two statements that the flug was not blummed.\n\nAnswer: no",
