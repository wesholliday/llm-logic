This means that vreebling a smonk will always result in it plagging. \n\nThe second statement introduces a possibility: the smonk might not have plagged. This does not contradict the first statement, because it does not say that the smonk definitely did not plag. It only suggests that it's possible the smonk did not plag.\n\nHowever, if we know for certain that the smonk did not plag, then we can infer that the smonk was not vreebled, because vreebling a smonk always results in it plagging. But since we only have a possibility and not a certainty that the smonk did not plag, we cannot definitively infer that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: no",
