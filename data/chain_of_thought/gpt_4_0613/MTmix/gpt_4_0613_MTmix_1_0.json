In other words, if the flugel was blimmed, it is guaranteed that it was also zargled.\n\nThe second statement tells us that it is possible that the flugel was not zargled. This means that the condition of being zargled is not guaranteed.\n\nIf being blimmed guarantees being zargled, but being zargled is not guaranteed, then it is logical to infer that the flugel was not blimbed. If it had been blimmed, it would have had to be zargled, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
