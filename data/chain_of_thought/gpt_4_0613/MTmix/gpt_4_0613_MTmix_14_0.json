This means that being snugged is a necessary condition for being fleeked. \n\nThe second statement introduces a possibility: the clug might not have been snugged. This does not definitively state that the clug was not snugged, only that it's possible. \n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that the clug was not fleeked. The second statement does not confirm that the clug was not snugged, only that it might not have been. If it was indeed snugged, then it could still have been fleeked. \n\nAnswer: No",
