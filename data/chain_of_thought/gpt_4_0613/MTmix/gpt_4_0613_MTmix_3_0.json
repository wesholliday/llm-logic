This means that quanking is a necessary consequence of morphing. \n\nThe second statement introduces a possibility: the splat might not have quanked. This does not necessarily mean that the splat did not quank, but it opens up the possibility.\n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can infer that if the splat did not quank, then it could not have been morphed, because morphing necessarily leads to quanking. However, since the second statement only introduces the possibility of the splat not quanking, and does not confirm it, we cannot definitively infer that the splat was not morphed. \n\nAnswer: No",
