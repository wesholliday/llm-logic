The second statement is a conditional statement, which means if the first part (the glip was slogged) is true, then the second part (the glip was tragged) must also be true. However, the first statement tells us that the glip was not slogged. This means we cannot infer anything about whether the glip was tragged or not. The glip could have been tragged for some other reason not mentioned in the statements. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The glip was not tragged' from the given statements. \n\nAnswer: No",
