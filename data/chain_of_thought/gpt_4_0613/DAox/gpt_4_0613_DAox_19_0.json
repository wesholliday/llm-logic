The second statement is a conditional statement, which means if the first part (the smonk was vreebled) is true, then the second part (the smonk plagged) must also be true. However, the first statement tells us that the smonk was not vreebled. This means that the condition for the second statement is not met, so we cannot make any definitive conclusions about whether the smonk plagged or not. The smonk could have plagged for other reasons, or not plagged at all. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The smonk was not plagged' from these statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
