The second statement is a conditional statement, which means if the first part (the twonk was plinked) is true, then the second part (it was varnished) must also be true. However, the first statement tells us that the twonk was not plinked. This means the condition for the twonk to be varnished was not met. But this does not necessarily mean that the twonk was not varnished. There could be other conditions or ways for the twonk to be varnished that are not mentioned in the given statements. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The twonk was not varnished' based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
