This is a conditional statement, and it only tells us what happens if the wug was flooped. It does not tell us what happens if the wug did not floop. Therefore, we cannot infer from these two statements whether or not the wug bimmed the zoint. The wug could have bimmed the zoint under different circumstances, or it could have not bimmed the zoint at all. We simply do not have enough information to make this inference. \n\nAnswer: No",
