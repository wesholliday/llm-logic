The second statement is a conditional statement, which means if the first part (the wug was sproinged) is true, then the second part (it was garpled) must also be true. However, the first statement tells us that the wug was not sproinged. This means the condition for the second statement to be true is not met. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about whether the wug was garpled or not based on these statements. The wug could have been garpled for a different reason or not garpled at all. \n\nAnswer: No",
