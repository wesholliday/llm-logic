The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that the sprocket being daggled is dependent on the sprocket being cranked. However, this does not necessarily mean that the sprocket cannot be daggled if it is not cranked. There could be other ways or conditions under which the sprocket could be daggled. Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot definitively infer that 'The sprocket was not daggled'. \n\nAnswer: No",
