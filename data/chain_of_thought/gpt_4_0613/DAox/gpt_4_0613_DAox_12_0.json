However, since we know from the first statement that the smip was not shripped, we cannot infer from the second statement that the smip did or did not lup the zoint. The second statement only tells us what would happen if the smip was shripped, but it does not tell us what happens if the smip was not shripped. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The smip did not lup the zoint' from these two statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
