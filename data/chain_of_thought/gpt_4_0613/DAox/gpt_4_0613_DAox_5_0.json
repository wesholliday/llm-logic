The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the zinger was fraggled) is true, then the second part (the zinger was smoogled) must also be true. However, we know from the first statement that the zinger was not fraggled. This means that the condition for the second statement to be true is not met. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about whether the zinger was smoogled or not based on these statements. The zinger could have been smoogled for some other reason not mentioned in the statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
