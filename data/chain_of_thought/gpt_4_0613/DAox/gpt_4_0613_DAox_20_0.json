The second statement is a conditional statement, which means if the first part (the fleeg was bluttered) is true, then the second part (it surned) must also be true. However, we know from the first statement that 'the fleeg was not bluttered'. This means the condition for the fleeg to surn did not occur. However, we don't have information about whether the fleeg can surn under other conditions. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer 'The fleeg did not surn' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
