The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the shank was plooked) is true, then the second part (the shank was nugged) must also be true. However, the first statement tells us that the shank was not plooked. This means that the condition for the second statement is not met, so we cannot make any definitive conclusions about whether the shank was nugged or not. The shank could have been nugged through some other means or not nugged at all. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The shank was not nugged' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
