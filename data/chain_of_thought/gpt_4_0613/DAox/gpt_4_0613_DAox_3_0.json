It tells us that if a certain condition is met (the splat being morphed), then a certain outcome will occur (the splat quanking). However, it does not tell us what will happen if the condition is not met. In other words, it does not tell us whether or not the splat will quank if it is not morphed. Therefore, from the information given, we cannot infer that 'The splat did not quank'. \n\nAnswer: no",
