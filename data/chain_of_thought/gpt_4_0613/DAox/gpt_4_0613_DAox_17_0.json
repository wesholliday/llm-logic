However, the second statement does not tell us that the only way for the flob to movate is by being skizzled. There could be other conditions under which the flob movates. Therefore, just because the flob was not skizzled, we cannot definitively infer that the flob was not movated. It might have movated under some other condition. \n\nAnswer: No",
