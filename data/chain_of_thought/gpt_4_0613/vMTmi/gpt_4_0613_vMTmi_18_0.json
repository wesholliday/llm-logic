            "content": "The form of argument in question is a form of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens works as follows: if P implies Q, and not-Q is true, then not-P must also be true. In this case, P is 'the doll was plastic' and Q is 'the truck was metal'. The second premise states that not-Q might be true, which implies that not-P might also be true. However, the conclusion states that not-P is definitely true, not just possibly true. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion is stronger than what the premises allow for. \n\nAnswer: No",
