            "content": "The form of argument in question is a form of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens works as follows: if P implies Q, and Q is not true, then P must also not be true. In this case, P is 'Mary was at the wedding' and Q is 'Sue was at the wedding'. The first premise states that P implies Q. The second premise states that Q might not be true. Therefore, if Q might not be true, then P might also not be true. However, the conclusion states definitively that P is not true, not that it might not be true. Therefore, the argument is not valid because the conclusion does not follow logically from the premises. The premises only establish that Mary might not have been at the wedding, not that she definitely was not. \n\nAnswer: No",
