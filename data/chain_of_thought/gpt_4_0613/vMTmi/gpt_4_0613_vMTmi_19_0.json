Therefore, not P. \n\nIn this case, P is 'Tom watched football' and Q is 'Jen watched basketball'. The first premise is 'If P, then Q', the second premise is 'Not Q', and the conclusion is 'Not P'. \n\nHowever, the second premise in this argument is 'Jen might not have watched basketball', which is not the same as 'Jen did not watch basketball'. The word 'might' introduces a possibility, not a certainty. Therefore, the second premise does not definitively negate Q, which is necessary for Modus Tollens to be valid. \n\nSo, the argument does not strictly follow the structure of Modus Tollens and is not logically valid.",
