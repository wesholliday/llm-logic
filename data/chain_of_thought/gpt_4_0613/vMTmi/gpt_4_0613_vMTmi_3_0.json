            "content": "The form of argument being used here is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens works like this: if we have a conditional statement (if P then Q), and we know that Q is not true, then we can conclude that P is not true. In this case, P is 'the book was written by James' and Q is 'the book is a mystery novel'. The first premise is the conditional statement (if P then Q), and the second premise tells us that Q might not be true. Therefore, we can conclude that P is not true, which is 'the book was not written by James'. However, the second premise is not definitively stating that the book is not a mystery novel, it's only suggesting the possibility. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the book was not written by James. \n\nAnswer: No",
