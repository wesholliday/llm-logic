            "content": "The form of argument being used here is known as Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens is a valid form of argument that follows this structure: If P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P. \n\nIn this case, P is 'the apple was red' and Q is 'the banana must have been yellow'. The argument states: If the apple was red (P), then the banana must have been yellow (Q). The banana might not have been yellow (Not Q). Therefore, the apple was not red (Not P).\n\nHowever, the second premise states that the banana 'might not have been yellow', which is not the same as 'the banana was not yellow'. The use of 'might' introduces a possibility, not a certainty. Therefore, it does not definitively negate Q, which is necessary for Modus Tollens to be valid.\n\nSo, the argument is not logically valid because it does not strictly follow the structure of Modus Tollens. \n\nAnswer: No",
