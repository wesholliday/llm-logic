            "content": "The form of argument being used here is called Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens is a valid form of argument that goes like this: If P then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P. \n\nIn this case, P is 'the vampire was awake' and Q is 'the mummy must have been awake'. The second premise states 'The mummy might not have been awake', which is not a definite 'Not Q'. It's a possibility, not a certainty. \n\nFor Modus Tollens to be valid, the second premise needs to definitively negate Q. In this case, it would need to state 'The mummy was not awake'. Since it only states that the mummy might not have been awake, the argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
