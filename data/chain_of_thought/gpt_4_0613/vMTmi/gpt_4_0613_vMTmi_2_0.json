            "content": "The form of argument being used here is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens works like this: if P implies Q, and Q is not true, then P must also not be true. In this case, P is 'the griffin was in the forest' and Q is 'the unicorn must have been in the forest'. The first premise states that if P is true, then Q is true. The second premise states that Q might not be true. Therefore, according to modus tollens, if Q might not be true, then P might not be true as well. So, the conclusion that 'the griffin was not in the forest' is logically valid based on the premises given. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
