            "content": "The form of argument is called Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus Tollens works like this: If P then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P. In this case, P is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and Q is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. The second premise states that 'Mark might not have bought the blue shirt', which is equivalent to 'Not Q'. Therefore, according to Modus Tollens, we can conclude 'Not P', which is 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'. So, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
