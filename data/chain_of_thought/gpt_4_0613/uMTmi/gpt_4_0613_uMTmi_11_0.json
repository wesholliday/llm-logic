However, the statement \"the muffins might not have been blueberry\" suggests that there is a possibility that the muffins were not blueberry. If we combine these two statements, we can infer that since there is a possibility that the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake could not have been chocolate. This is because if the cake were chocolate, the muffins would have to be blueberry, which contradicts the possibility that the muffins might not have been blueberry. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
