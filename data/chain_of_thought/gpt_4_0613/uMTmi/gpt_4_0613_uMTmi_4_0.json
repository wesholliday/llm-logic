This means that the alien's visit to Mars guarantees the robot's visit to Jupiter. However, the second statement introduces uncertainty about whether the robot visited Jupiter. If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then according to the first statement, the alien could not have visited Mars. But if the robot did visit Jupiter, it doesn't provide any information about the alien's visit to Mars. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the alien did not visit Mars based on the information given. \n\nAnswer: no",
