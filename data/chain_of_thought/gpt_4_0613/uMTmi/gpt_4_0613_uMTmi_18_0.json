            "content": "The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" is a conditional statement. It means that if the first part (the doll being plastic) is true, then the second part (the truck being metal) must also be true. However, the second statement \"the truck might not have been metal\" suggests that the second part of the conditional statement might not be true. If the second part of the conditional statement is not true, then the first part (the doll being plastic) cannot be true either, because if it were, then the truck would have to be metal, which contradicts the second statement. Therefore, we can infer that the doll was not plastic. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
