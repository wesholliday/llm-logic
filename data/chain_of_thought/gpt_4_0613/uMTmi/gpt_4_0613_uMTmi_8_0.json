This means that the vampire's wakefulness guarantees the mummy's wakefulness. However, it does not mean that the mummy's sleepiness guarantees the vampire's sleepiness. \n\nThe second statement says that the mummy might not have been awake. This does not contradict the first statement, because the first statement does not guarantee that the mummy is always awake. \n\nHowever, these two statements together do not provide enough information to infer anything about the vampire's state of wakefulness. The vampire could have been asleep while the mummy was also asleep, or the vampire could have been awake while the mummy was also awake. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the vampire was not awake based on these statements. \n\nAnswer: No",
