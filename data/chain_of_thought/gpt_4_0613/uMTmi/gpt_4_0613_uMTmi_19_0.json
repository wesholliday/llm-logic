            "content": "The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\" implies that Jen watching basketball is a necessary condition for Tom watching football. In other words, if Tom watched football, it is certain that Jen watched basketball.\n\nThe second statement \"Jen might not have watched basketball\" implies that there is a possibility that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can infer that if there is a possibility that Jen did not watch basketball, then there is a possibility that Tom did not watch football. This is because Jen watching basketball is a necessary condition for Tom watching football. If the necessary condition is not met (i.e., Jen did not watch basketball), then the event (Tom watching football) cannot occur.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Tom did not watch football. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
