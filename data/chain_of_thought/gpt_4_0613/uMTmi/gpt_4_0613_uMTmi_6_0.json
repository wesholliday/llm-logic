This means that Sue's choice of pizza necessitates Bob's choice of pasta. \n\nThe second statement says that Bob might not have chosen pasta. This does not necessarily mean that Bob did not choose pasta, but it opens up the possibility that he chose something else.\n\nHowever, these two statements do not provide enough information to definitively infer that Sue did not choose pizza. It's possible that Sue chose pizza and Bob chose pasta, in line with the first statement. It's also possible that Sue chose pizza and Bob did not choose pasta, which would contradict the first statement. But without more information, we can't say for sure whether Sue chose pizza or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
