This could mean that Sam did not take a plane, because if he had, Erin would have had to take a train. However, it's also possible that Sam did take a plane and Erin did take a train, but there's some uncertainty about Erin's mode of transportation. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer from these statements that Sam did not take a plane. \n\nAnswer: no",
