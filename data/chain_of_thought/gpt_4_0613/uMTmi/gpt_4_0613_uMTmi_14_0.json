It means that if the first part (the bear being in the cave) is true, then the second part (the wolf being in the den) must also be true. \n\nThe second statement \"the wolf might not have been in the den\" introduces a possibility that the wolf was not in the den. \n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can infer that if the wolf was not in the den, then the bear could not have been in the cave. This is because the first statement established that if the bear is in the cave, the wolf must be in the den. So, if the wolf is not in the den, it contradicts the condition for the bear being in the cave.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
