            "content": "The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" implies a condition where the redness of the apple guarantees the yellowness of the banana. However, the second statement \"the banana might not have been yellow\" introduces a possibility where the banana is not yellow. If we consider these two statements together, we can infer that if the banana might not have been yellow, then the apple could not have been red. This is because if the apple was red, the banana would have to be yellow, according to the first statement. Therefore, if there's a chance the banana wasn't yellow, the apple couldn't have been red. \n\nAnswer: yes",
