This means that Ben eating pasta guarantees that Kate ate salad. \n\nThe second statement tells us that Kate might not have eaten salad. This means that there is a possibility that Kate did not eat salad.\n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can infer that if there is a possibility that Kate did not eat salad, then there is a possibility that Ben did not eat pasta. This is because if Ben had eaten pasta, then Kate would have definitely eaten salad, according to the first statement. \n\nTherefore, if there is a chance that Kate did not eat salad, then Ben could not have eaten pasta. \n\nAnswer: Yes.",
