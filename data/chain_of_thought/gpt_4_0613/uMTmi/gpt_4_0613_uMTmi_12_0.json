This means that Joe's going to the park guarantees Lucy's presence at the zoo. \n\nThe second statement says that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo. This means that there is a possibility that Lucy did not go to the zoo. \n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can infer that if there is a possibility that Lucy did not go to the zoo, then it must be the case that Joe did not go to the park. This is because if Joe had gone to the park, then Lucy would have had to go to the zoo, according to the first statement. \n\nTherefore, if there is a chance that Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe could not have gone to the park. \n\nAnswer: Yes.",
