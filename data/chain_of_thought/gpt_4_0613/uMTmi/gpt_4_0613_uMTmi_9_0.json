This means that Lisa buying the red shirt guarantees that Mark bought the blue shirt. \n\nThe second statement tells us that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. This contradicts the condition that would be created if Lisa bought the red shirt. \n\nTherefore, if Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, then Lisa could not have bought the red shirt, because if she had, Mark would have to have bought the blue shirt. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
