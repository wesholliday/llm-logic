However, the second statement \"the pants might not have been denim\" does not necessarily mean that the shirt was not cotton. It could be that the pants were not denim in a situation where the shirt was not cotton. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the shirt was not cotton based on the information given. \n\nAnswer: No",
