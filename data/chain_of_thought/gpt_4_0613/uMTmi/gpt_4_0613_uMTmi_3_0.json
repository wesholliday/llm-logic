The second statement says that the book might not be a mystery novel. If it's possible that the book is not a mystery novel, and all books by James are mystery novels, then it's possible that the book was not written by James. However, this does not definitively prove that the book was not written by James. It could still be a mystery novel and thus could still have been written by James. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the book was not written by James based on these statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
