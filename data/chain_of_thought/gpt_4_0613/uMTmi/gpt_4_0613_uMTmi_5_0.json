This means that Jeff playing basketball guarantees that Amy played tennis. \n\nThe second statement says that Amy might not have played tennis. This means that there is a possibility that Amy did not play tennis. \n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can infer that if Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff could not have played basketball. This is because if Jeff had played basketball, Amy would have had to play tennis, according to the first statement. \n\nTherefore, if there is a possibility that Amy did not play tennis, there must also be a possibility that Jeff did not play basketball. \n\nHowever, this does not guarantee that Jeff did not play basketball. It only establishes a possibility. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that Jeff did not play basketball. \n\nAnswer: No",
