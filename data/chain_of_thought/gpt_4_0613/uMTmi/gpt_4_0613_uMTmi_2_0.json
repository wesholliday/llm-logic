This means that the presence of the griffin guarantees the presence of the unicorn. However, the second statement says that the unicorn might not have been in the forest. If the unicorn might not have been in the forest, and the griffin's presence guarantees the unicorn's presence, then it is logical to infer that the griffin was not in the forest. If the griffin had been in the forest, the unicorn would have to be there too, contradicting the possibility that the unicorn might not have been in the forest. \n\nAnswer: yes",
