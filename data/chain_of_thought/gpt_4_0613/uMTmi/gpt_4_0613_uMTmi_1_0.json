The second statement tells us that it's possible that Sue was not at the wedding. If we combine these two statements, we can infer that Mary could not have been at the wedding. This is because if Mary were at the wedding, Sue would have to be there too, according to the first statement. But since Sue might not have been at the wedding, it's logical to infer that Mary was not there either, to maintain the truth of the first statement. \n\nAnswer: yes",
