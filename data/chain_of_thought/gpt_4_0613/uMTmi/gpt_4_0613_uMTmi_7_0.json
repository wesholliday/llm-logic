This means that Alex finishing the race guarantees that Chris also finishes the race. \n\nThe second statement says that Chris might not have finished the race. This means that there is a possibility that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can infer that if Chris might not have finished the race, then Alex could not have finished the race. This is because if Alex had finished, then Chris would have to have finished, according to the first statement. But since there's a possibility that Chris did not finish, Alex could not have finished the race.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race. \n\nAnswer: yes",
