The second statement introduces uncertainty about the umbrella being in the closet, but it does not definitively rule out this possibility. It only suggests that the umbrella might not be in the closet, but it could still be there. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the umbrella is in the car based on these two statements. \n\nAnswer: no",
