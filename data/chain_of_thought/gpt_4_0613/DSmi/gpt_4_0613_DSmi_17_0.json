The second statement introduces uncertainty about the scarf being on the coat rack, but it doesn't completely rule out that possibility. It just says that the scarf might not be there, not that it definitely isn't. Therefore, even with the uncertainty about the coat rack, we can't definitively conclude that the scarf must be in the backpack. It could still be on the coat rack or even somewhere else entirely. \n\nAnswer: No",
