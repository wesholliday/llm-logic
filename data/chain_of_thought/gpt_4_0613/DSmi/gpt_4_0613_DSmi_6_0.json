The second statement tells us that it might not be ringing in the kitchen. However, this does not definitively rule out the possibility that it is ringing in the kitchen. It only suggests that it might not be. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the phone is in the living room based on these two statements. \n\nAnswer: no",
