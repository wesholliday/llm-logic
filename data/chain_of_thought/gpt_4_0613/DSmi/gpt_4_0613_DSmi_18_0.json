The second statement introduces uncertainty about the notebook being on the nightstand, but it doesn't completely rule out this possibility. It just says that the notebook might not be on the nightstand, not that it definitely isn't. Therefore, even with the uncertainty about the notebook being on the nightstand, we can't definitively conclude that the notebook is in the drawer. \n\nAnswer: no",
