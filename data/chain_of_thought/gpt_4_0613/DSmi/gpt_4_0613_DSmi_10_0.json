The second statement introduces some doubt about the sock being under the bed, but it doesn't completely rule out this possibility. It only says that the sock might not be under the bed, not that it definitely isn't. Therefore, even with the doubt introduced by the second statement, we can't definitively conclude that the sock is in the laundry basket. \n\nAnswer: No",
