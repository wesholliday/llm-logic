The second statement introduces uncertainty about the book being on the table, but it doesn't completely rule out the possibility. It just says the book might not be on the table, not that it definitely isn't. Therefore, even with the uncertainty about the book being on the table, we can't definitively conclude that the book is on the shelf. \n\nAnswer: no",
