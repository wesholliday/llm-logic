The second statement introduces uncertainty about the pen being on the desk, but it does not definitively rule out that possibility. It merely suggests that the pen might not be on the desk, but it could still be there. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the pen is in the bag based on these two statements. \n\nAnswer: No",
