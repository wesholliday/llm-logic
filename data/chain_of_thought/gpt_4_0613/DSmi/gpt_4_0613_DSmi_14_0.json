The second statement introduces uncertainty about the milk being in the fridge, but it does not definitively state that the milk is not in the fridge. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the milk is on the counter. The milk might still be in the fridge, or it might be somewhere else entirely. The statements do not provide enough information to make a definitive inference. \n\nAnswer: no",
