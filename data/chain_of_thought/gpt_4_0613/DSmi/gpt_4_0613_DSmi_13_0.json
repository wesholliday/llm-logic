The second statement introduces uncertainty about the toy being on the bookshelf. However, it does not definitively state that the toy is not on the bookshelf. It only suggests that it might not be there. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the toy is in the toy box based on these two statements. \n\nAnswer: No",
