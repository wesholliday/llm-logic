The second statement introduces some doubt about the keys being in the cabinet, but it does not definitively rule out this possibility. The keys might not be in the cabinet, but they also might be. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the keys are in the drawer based on these two statements. \n\nAnswer: no",
