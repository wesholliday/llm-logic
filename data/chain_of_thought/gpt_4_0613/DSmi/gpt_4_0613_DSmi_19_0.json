The second statement introduces uncertainty about the watch being on his wrist. However, it does not definitively rule out the possibility that the watch could be on his wrist. It just says that it might not be on his wrist, but it also might be. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the watch is charging on the dresser just based on these two statements. \n\nAnswer: No",
