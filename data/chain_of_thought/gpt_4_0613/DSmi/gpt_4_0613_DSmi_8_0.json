The second statement introduces uncertainty about the remote being under the couch, but it does not completely rule out this possibility. It only suggests that the remote might not be under the couch, but it also might be. Therefore, even with the uncertainty about the remote being under the couch, we cannot definitively conclude that the remote is on the coffee table. \n\nAnswer: no",
