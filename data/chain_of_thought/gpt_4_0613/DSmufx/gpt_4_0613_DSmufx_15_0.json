The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities: it's not the case that the dreb must be spened. Given that one of the two initial possibilities has been ruled out, the only remaining possibility is that the dreb is vroombed. Therefore, we can infer that the dreb is vroombed. \n\nAnswer: yes",
