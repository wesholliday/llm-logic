The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities, stating that it is not the case that the fribble must be crinked. Given that these are the only two possibilities presented for the fribble, if it is not crinked, then it must be snurgled. Therefore, we can infer from these two statements that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
