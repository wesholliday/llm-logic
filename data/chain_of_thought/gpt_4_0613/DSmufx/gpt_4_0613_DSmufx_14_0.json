This is an example of a disjunction in logic, where at least one of the conditions must be true. \n\nThe second statement negates one of these possibilities: it's not the case that the clug must be snugged. \n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that the other condition must be true. If it's not the case that the clug must be snugged, and either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked, then it must be the case that the clug is fleeked. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
