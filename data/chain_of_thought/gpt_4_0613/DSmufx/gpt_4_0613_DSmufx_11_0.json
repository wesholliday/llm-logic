These are the only two options given, and the statement implies that one of them must be true. \n\nThe second statement tells us that it's not the case that the flug must be zimmed. This eliminates one of the possibilities presented in the first statement.\n\nSince the first statement told us that one of the two possibilities must be true, and the second statement eliminated one of those possibilities, we are left with only one possibility: the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
