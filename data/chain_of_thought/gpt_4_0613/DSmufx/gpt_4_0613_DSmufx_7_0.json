The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities: it's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked. Given that one of the two initial possibilities has been ruled out, the only remaining possibility is that the whiffle is shanked. Therefore, we can infer from these two statements that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
