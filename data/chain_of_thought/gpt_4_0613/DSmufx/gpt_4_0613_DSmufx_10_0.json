This is an example of a logical disjunction, where at least one of the conditions must be true. \n\nThe second statement negates one of these possibilities: it's not the case that the wug must be garpled. \n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can infer that the other condition must be true. If it's not the case that the wug must be garpled, then according to the first statement, the wug must be sproinged. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
