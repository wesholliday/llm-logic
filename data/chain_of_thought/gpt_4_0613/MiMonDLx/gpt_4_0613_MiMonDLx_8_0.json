When we add 'or grazzle' to the statement, it doesn't negate the original possibility that 'gribble' might be 'quork'. It simply adds another possibility that 'gribble' might be 'grazzle'. Therefore, the original statement does not contradict the new statement 'The gribble might be quork or grazzle'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
