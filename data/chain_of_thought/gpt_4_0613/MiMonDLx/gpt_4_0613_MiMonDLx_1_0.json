            "content": "Explanation: The original statement says that \"The blurble might be wibble a frozz\". This means there is a possibility that the blurble could be wibble a frozz. The second statement adds an additional possibility, that \"The blurble might be wibble a frozz or plonk\". This doesn't contradict the original statement, it simply adds another potential outcome. Therefore, it can be inferred from the original statement, as it doesn't change the original possibility, but merely adds to it.\n\nAnswer: yes",
