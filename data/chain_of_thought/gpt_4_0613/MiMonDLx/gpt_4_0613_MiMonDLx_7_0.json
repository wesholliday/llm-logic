The statement 'The frazzle might be wozzle or on flump' is an extension of the first statement, adding another possibility that 'frazzle' could be 'on flump'. The second statement does not contradict the first one, it simply adds another potential outcome. Therefore, it is possible to infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
