When we add 'or snork' to the statement, it doesn't negate the original possibility of 'zibble' being 'wozzle'. It simply adds another possibility that 'zibble' might be 'snork'. Therefore, the original statement does not contradict the inference 'The zibble might be wozzle or snork'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
