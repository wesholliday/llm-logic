            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The snork might be plonk' implies that there is a possibility that 'snork' could be 'plonk'. When we add 'or wobble' to the statement, we are simply expanding the range of possibilities for what 'snork' could be. This does not contradict or change the original statement, it just adds another potential outcome. Therefore, if 'The snork might be plonk', it is also true that 'The snork might be plonk or wobble'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
