When we say 'The frazzle might be wump or quimble', we are expanding the possibilities for what 'frazzle' could be. This expanded statement still includes the original possibility that 'frazzle' could be 'wump'. Therefore, the original statement does not contradict the expanded statement, and we can infer the expanded statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
