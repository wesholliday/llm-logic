The conclusion, however, specifies a condition - that the medication is expired. The premise does not provide enough information to support the conclusion. The effectiveness of expired medication is not addressed in the premise, so we cannot logically conclude that taking expired medication will result in feeling better. \n\nAnswer: No",
