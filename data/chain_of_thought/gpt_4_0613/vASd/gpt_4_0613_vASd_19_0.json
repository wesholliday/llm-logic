However, the conclusion introduces a new condition - a hole in the gas tank. If there is a hole in the gas tank, the gas will leak out and the car may not run, even if the tank was initially filled. The conclusion is not necessarily true given the premise, so the argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: no",
