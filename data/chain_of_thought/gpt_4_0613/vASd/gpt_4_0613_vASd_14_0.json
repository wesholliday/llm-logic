However, the conclusion 'If I study hard and the test is in Chinese, I will pass the test' introduces an additional condition - that the test is in Chinese. \n\nThe premise does not provide any information about the language of the test or how it might affect the outcome. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the conclusion from the premise. The argument assumes that studying hard will lead to passing the test regardless of the language of the test, but this is not stated or implied in the premise. \n\nSo, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion introduces a new condition that is not addressed in the premise. \n\nAnswer: No",
