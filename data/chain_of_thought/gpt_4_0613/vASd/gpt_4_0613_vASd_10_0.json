However, the conclusion adds an additional condition - that the item is out of stock. The premise does not account for the possibility of the item being out of stock. Therefore, the conclusion is not necessarily true based on the premise. The premise would need to include information about what happens when an item is out of stock for the conclusion to be logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
