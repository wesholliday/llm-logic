However, the conclusion introduces a new condition - that the person is wearing earplugs. Earplugs are generally used to reduce the volume of sounds, so it's possible that if the person is wearing earplugs, a scream might not hurt their ears. The conclusion is not necessarily true based on the given premise, so the argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: no",
