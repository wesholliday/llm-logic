The premise 'If the match is struck, then it will light' does not account for any conditions that might prevent the match from lighting. The conclusion 'If the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will light' introduces a new condition - the match being soaked in water - that was not present in the premise. This new condition could potentially prevent the match from lighting, even if it is struck. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise, making the argument invalid. \n\nAnswer: No",
