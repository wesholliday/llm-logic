However, the conclusion adds an additional condition - that the essay is turned in late. The premise does not provide any information about what happens when an essay is turned in late. It's possible that turning in an essay late could result in a lower grade, regardless of the quality of the essay. Therefore, the conclusion is not necessarily true based on the given premise. \n\nAnswer: No",
