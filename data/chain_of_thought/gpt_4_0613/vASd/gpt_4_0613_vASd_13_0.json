The premise only states that exercise leads to weight loss. It does not provide any information about the effect of eating junk food on weight loss. It is possible that eating junk food could counteract the effects of exercise and prevent weight loss. Therefore, the conclusion is not necessarily true based on the premise. \n\nAnswer: No",
