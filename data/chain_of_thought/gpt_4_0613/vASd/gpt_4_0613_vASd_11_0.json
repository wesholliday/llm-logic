However, the conclusion adds an additional condition - doing hard labor - without providing any information about the relationship between doing hard labor and not being tired. It's possible that even with enough sleep, doing hard labor could still make you tired. Therefore, the conclusion is not necessarily true based on the given premise. \n\nAnswer: No",
