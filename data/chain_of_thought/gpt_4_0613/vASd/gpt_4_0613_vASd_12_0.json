However, the conclusion introduces an additional condition - the computer catching on fire. The premise does not account for this additional condition. If the computer catches on fire, it's likely that playing video games would not be possible, regardless of whether the homework is finished or not. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise. \n\nAnswer: No",
