However, the conclusion introduces a new condition - a bomb going off. This new condition is not accounted for in the premise and could significantly alter the outcome. The premise does not guarantee a good time if a bomb goes off at the concert. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise. \n\nAnswer: No",
