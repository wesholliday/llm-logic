However, the conclusion introduces a new condition - that the package was misrouted. Misrouting a package could potentially delay its arrival, which contradicts the premise that the package will arrive today if it has shipped. The conclusion is making an assumption that is not supported by the premise. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
