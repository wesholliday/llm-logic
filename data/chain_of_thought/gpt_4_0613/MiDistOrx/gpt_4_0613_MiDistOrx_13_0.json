This implies that there are two possibilities for the location or state of the gronk: it could be in frozz, or it could be in zibber. The rephrased sentence, \"The gronk might be in frozz or it might be zibber\", is essentially saying the same thing, just with slightly different wording. Both sentences express the same two possibilities for the gronk.\n\nAnswer: yes",
