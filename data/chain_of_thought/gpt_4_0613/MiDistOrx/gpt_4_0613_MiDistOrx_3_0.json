            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence states that the snork might be in the wibble or on the quank. This means that there are two possibilities for the location of the snork: it could be in the wibble, or it could be on the quank. The proposed inference, \"The snork might be in the wibble or it might be on the quank\", is essentially saying the same thing. It's just rephrasing the two possibilities in a slightly different way. Therefore, we can infer the proposed sentence from the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
