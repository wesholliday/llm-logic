It might be 'plimp on bimboozle' or it might be 'zibber for flibbit zazzle'. The proposed inference 'The snizzle might be plimp on bimboozle or it might be zibber for flibbit zazzle' is essentially the same sentence, just with an additional 'it might be' added for clarity. The meaning of the sentence is not changed by this addition, so we can infer the second sentence from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
