This means that there are two possibilities for the location of the wibble: it could either be on the zizz or in the snizzle. The proposed inference, \"The wibble might be on the zizz or it might be in the snizzle\", is essentially saying the same thing. It's just rephrasing the original sentence to emphasize the two possibilities separately, but it doesn't change the meaning or the information conveyed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
