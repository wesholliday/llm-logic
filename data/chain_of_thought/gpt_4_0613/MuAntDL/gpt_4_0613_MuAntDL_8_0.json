It could either have been closed all day, or it could have been open but only for a limited number of hours. The statement does not definitively say that the restaurant was closed on Monday, only that it was one of the possibilities. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The restaurant must have been closed on Monday' based solely on this statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
