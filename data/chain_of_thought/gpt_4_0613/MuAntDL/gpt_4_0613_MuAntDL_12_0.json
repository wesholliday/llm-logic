The question asks if we can infer that the project must have been completed by Friday. However, this inference would ignore the second possible outcome provided in the original statement, which is that the project could have been extended. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the project must have been completed by Friday, as it could also have been extended.\n\nAnswer: no",
