            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The concert must have been sold out or postponed' presents two possibilities for the status of the concert. It could either be sold out or it could be postponed. The use of the word 'or' indicates that either one of these situations could be true, but not necessarily both. Therefore, from this statement, we cannot definitively infer that 'The concert must have been sold out' because it could also have been postponed.\n\nAnswer: No",
