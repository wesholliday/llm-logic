            "content": "The statement 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was not spened' is a conditional statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of a statement 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'. \n\nSo, in this case, the contrapositive of 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was not spened' would be 'If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed'. \n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed' from 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was not spened'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
