            "content": "The statement 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was not zimmed' is a conditional statement. In logic, if we have a conditional statement 'if p then q', the contrapositive of this statement is 'if not q then not p'. The contrapositive always has the same truth value as the original statement. \n\nIn this case, 'the flug was blummed' is p and 'the flug was not zimmed' is q. The contrapositive of the given statement would be 'If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was not blummed'. Therefore, we can infer 'If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was not blummed' from 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was not zimmed'. \n\nAnswer: yes",
