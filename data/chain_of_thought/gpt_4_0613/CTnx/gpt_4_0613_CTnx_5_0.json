In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of a statement 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'. \n\nSo, the contrapositive of the given statement 'If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled' would be 'If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled'. \n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled' from 'If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
