It states that if a certain condition (the shank being plooked) is true, then another condition (the shank not being nugged) is also true. \n\nThe inverse of this statement would be 'If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was nugged'. This is not the same as 'If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked'. \n\nThe original statement does not provide information about what happens when the shank is nugged. It only provides information about what happens when the shank is plooked. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
