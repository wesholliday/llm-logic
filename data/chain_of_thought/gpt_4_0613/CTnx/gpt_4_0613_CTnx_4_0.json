This is a conditional statement where 'the fribble was snurgled' is the condition and 'the fribble did not crink' is the result. \n\nThe question asks if we can infer 'If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled' from the original statement. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of a statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. \n\nIn this case, 'P' is 'the fribble was snurgled' and 'Q' is 'the fribble did not crink'. The contrapositive 'If not Q, then not P' would be 'If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled', which is exactly the statement we are asked to infer. \n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled' from the original statement 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
