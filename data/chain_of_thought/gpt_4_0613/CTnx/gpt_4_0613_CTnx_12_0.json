In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then swapping them. So, the contrapositive of the given statement would be 'If the smip did lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped'. This is exactly the statement we are asked to infer, so it is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
