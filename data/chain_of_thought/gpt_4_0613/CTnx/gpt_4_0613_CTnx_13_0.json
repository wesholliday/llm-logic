            "content": "The statement 'If the glip was slogged, then the glip was not tragged' is a conditional statement. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement 'If p, then q' is 'If not p, then not q'. However, the inverse is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true. The question asks us to infer 'If the glip was tragged, then the glip was not slogged', which is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If p, then q' is 'If not q, then not p'. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer 'If the glip was tragged, then the glip was not slogged' from 'If the glip was slogged, then the glip was not tragged'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
