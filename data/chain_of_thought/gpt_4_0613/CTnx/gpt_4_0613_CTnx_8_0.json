In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not P, then not Q'. However, the inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The statement 'If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked' is the converse of the original statement, not the inverse. The converse of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If Q, then P'. The converse is also not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the converse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
