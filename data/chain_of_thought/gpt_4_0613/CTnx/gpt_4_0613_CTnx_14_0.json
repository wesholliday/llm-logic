This is a conditional statement where 'the clug was fleeked' is the condition and 'the clug did not snugged' is the result. \n\nThe question asks if we can infer 'If the clug snugged, then the clug was not fleeked' from the given statement. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the condition and the result and reversing their order. \n\nSo, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer 'If the clug snugged, then the clug was not fleeked' from 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug did not snugged'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
