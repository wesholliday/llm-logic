For example, if we say \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet,\" it does not necessarily mean \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining,\" because there could be other reasons for the ground to be wet (like someone watering the lawn). \n\nSo, applying this to the whiffle situation, just because shanking the whiffle leads to not tinking it, it does not necessarily mean that if the whiffle tinks, it was not shanked. There could be other reasons for the whiffle to tink. \n\nAnswer: No",
