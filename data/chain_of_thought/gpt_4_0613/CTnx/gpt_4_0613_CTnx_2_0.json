This is a conditional statement where 'the wug was flooped' is the condition and 'the wug did not bim the zoint' is the result. \n\nThe question asks if we can infer 'If the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was not flooped' from the original statement. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nThe contrapositive of a statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. In this case, P is 'the wug was flooped' and Q is 'the wug did not bim the zoint'. So, 'If not Q, then not P' becomes 'If the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was not flooped', which is exactly the statement we are asked to infer. \n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was not flooped' from 'If the wug was flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
