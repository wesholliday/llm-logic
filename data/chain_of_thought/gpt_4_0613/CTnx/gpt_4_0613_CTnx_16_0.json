This is a conditional statement where 'the sneg was crampled' is the condition and 'the sneg did not sproted the frink' is the result. \n\nThe question asks us to infer 'If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled'. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nThe contrapositive is formed by negating both the condition and the result of the original statement and swapping their places. So, the contrapositive of the original statement would be 'If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled'. \n\nHowever, the statement we are asked to infer is not the contrapositive of the original statement. It is actually the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of a statement is not always logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled' from 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg did not sproted the frink'.\n\nAnswer: No",
