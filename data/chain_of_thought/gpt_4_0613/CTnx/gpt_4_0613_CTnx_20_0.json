This is a conditional statement where 'the fleeg was bluttered' is the condition and 'it did not surn' is the result. \n\nThe question asks if we can infer 'If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered' from the original statement. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nThe contrapositive of a statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. In this case, P is 'the fleeg was bluttered' and Q is 'it did not surn'. So, 'If not Q, then not P' translates to 'If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered', which is exactly the statement we are asked to infer. \n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered' from 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it did not surn'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
