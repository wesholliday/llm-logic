            "content": "The original statement is 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat did not quank'. This is a conditional statement where the condition is 'the splat was morphed' and the result is 'the splat did not quank'. \n\nThe question asks if we can infer 'If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed' from the original statement. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of a statement 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'. \n\nIn this case, 'P' is 'the splat was morphed' and 'Q' is 'the splat did not quank'. So, 'not P' is 'the splat was not morphed' and 'not Q' is 'the splat quank'. Therefore, 'If not Q then not P' is 'If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed', which is exactly the statement we are asked to infer. \n\nSo, based on the rules of logic, we can infer 'If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed' from 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat did not quank'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
