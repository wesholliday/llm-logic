The proposed inference, \"The project must have been extended or completed by Friday,\" introduces a new possibility that the project could have been extended. However, the original statement does not provide any information about the possibility of an extension. Therefore, we cannot infer from the original statement that the project could have been extended.\n\nAnswer: No",
