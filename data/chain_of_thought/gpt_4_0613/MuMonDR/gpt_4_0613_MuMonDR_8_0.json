This is a more specific condition than 'The restaurant must have been open for limited hours or closed on Mondays', which includes the possibility of the restaurant being open for some time on Mondays. Since being closed all day is a subset of being open for limited hours or closed, we can infer the latter from the former.\n\nAnswer: yes",
