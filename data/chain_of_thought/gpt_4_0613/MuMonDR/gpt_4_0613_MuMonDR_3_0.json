The statement 'The keys must be on the table or in the drawer' suggests two possible locations for the keys - either on the table or in the drawer. Since the first statement has already confirmed that the keys are in the drawer, it is also true that the keys are either on the table or in the drawer, because one of the conditions (keys being in the drawer) of the second statement is met.\n\nAnswer: yes",
