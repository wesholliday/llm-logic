This is because the latter statement includes the possibility of the envelope being under a bed, but also adds an additional possibility of the envelope being upstairs. Therefore, if we know for certain that the envelope is under a bed, it is also true that the envelope is either upstairs or under a bed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
