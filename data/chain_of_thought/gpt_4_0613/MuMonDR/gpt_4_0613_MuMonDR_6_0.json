The statement 'The concert must have been postponed or sold out' is a disjunction, meaning that either the concert was postponed or it was sold out. Since we know from the first statement that the concert was sold out, it fits within the parameters of the second statement. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
