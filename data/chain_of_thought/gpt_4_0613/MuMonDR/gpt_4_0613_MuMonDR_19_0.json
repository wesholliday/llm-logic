However, the statement 'The application must have been completed in person or online' suggests that there were two options for completing the application: in person or online. This is a broader statement that includes the possibility of online completion, but also adds another option, which is in-person completion. Therefore, the first statement does not necessarily infer the second one, as the second one provides an additional option that was not mentioned in the first statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
