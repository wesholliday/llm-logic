            "content": "Explanation: The original statement, \"The room must have been cleaned daily,\" implies a regular, daily cleaning schedule. The proposed inference, \"The room must have been cleaned upon request or daily,\" suggests two possible scenarios: the room was cleaned daily, or it was cleaned upon request. Since the original statement confirms that the room was cleaned daily, it fits within the scope of the proposed inference. Therefore, we can infer the proposed statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
