The second statement 'The book must be in the library or on the shelf' is a disjunction, meaning the book could be in either of the two places. Since the first statement confirms that the book is on the shelf, it fits within the possibilities of the second statement. Therefore, the first statement does imply the second.\n\nAnswer: yes",
