This means that it is not a certainty that the vampire was awake. If it is not a certainty, then it is not the case that the vampire must have been awake. \"Must\" implies a necessity or a certainty, which is not present in the original statement. Therefore, we can infer that it's not the case that the vampire must have been awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
