            "content": "The statement \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" implies that there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding. This means that her presence at the wedding is not certain or guaranteed. If it were the case that \"Mary must have been at the wedding\", it would mean that her presence at the wedding was certain or necessary. Since the first statement suggests that her presence is not certain, it contradicts the idea that her presence was necessary or certain. Therefore, if it's possible that Mary was not at the wedding, we can infer that it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
