However, this does not necessarily mean that it's not the case that Alex must have finished the race. The word \"must\" implies certainty, while \"might not\" implies uncertainty. Therefore, even if there is a possibility that Alex did not finish the race, it does not rule out the possibility that he did. The two statements are not mutually exclusive. Therefore, we cannot infer that it's not the case that Alex must have finished the race based solely on the statement \"Alex might not have finished the race.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
