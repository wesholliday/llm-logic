Since we know that the sprocket was not daggled, and that cranking the sprocket would result in it being daggled, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked. If it had been cranked, it would contradict the first statement that the sprocket was not daggled. Therefore, the sprocket was not cranked. \n\nAnswer: yes",
