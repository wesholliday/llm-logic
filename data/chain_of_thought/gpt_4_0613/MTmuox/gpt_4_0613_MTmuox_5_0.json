Since we know from the first statement that the zinger was not smoogled, it follows that the zinger could not have been fraggled, because if it had been, it would have had to have been smoogled, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
