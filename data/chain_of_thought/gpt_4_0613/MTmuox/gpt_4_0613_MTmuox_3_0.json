Since we know from the first statement that the splat did not quank, we can infer that the condition for the second statement (the splat being morphed) did not occur. If it had occurred, then the splat would have quanked, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that the splat was not morphed. \n\nAnswer: yes",
