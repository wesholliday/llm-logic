            "content": "Explanation: The two sentences are essentially saying the same thing, just with slightly different wording. The first sentence says \"The quorple must be at snork gribble and it must be in the wibble plonk\", while the second sentence says \"The quorple must be at snork gribble and in the wibble plonk\". The only difference is the removal of the second \"it must be\", but the meaning remains the same. Therefore, we can infer the second sentence from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
