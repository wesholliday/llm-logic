The second statement is \"The quork must be floob with crunk and plonk zibber flonk\". The difference between the two statements is the absence of \"it must be\" before \"plonk zibber flonk\" in the second statement. However, the meaning remains the same because the \"and\" in the second statement still implies that the quork must be both \"floob with crunk\" and \"plonk zibber flonk\". Therefore, the second statement can be inferred from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
