The second statement says \"The plimp must be fizzle snork and blimp frazzle\". The only difference between the two statements is the removal of the second \"it must\" in the second statement. However, the meaning of the two sentences remains the same because the requirements for the plimp (to be fizzle snork and to blimp frazzle) are still present in both sentences. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
