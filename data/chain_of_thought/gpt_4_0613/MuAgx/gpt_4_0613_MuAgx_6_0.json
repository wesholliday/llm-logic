            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence states that \"The wobble must be wumble fizzle and it must frazzle at wozzle zump\". The proposed inference removes the second \"it must\" before \"frazzle at wozzle zump\". This changes the structure of the sentence but not the meaning. Both sentences express that the wobble has to be wumble fizzle and also has to frazzle at wozzle zump. The second \"it must\" in the original sentence is redundant and its removal does not change the overall meaning.\n\nAnswer: yes",
