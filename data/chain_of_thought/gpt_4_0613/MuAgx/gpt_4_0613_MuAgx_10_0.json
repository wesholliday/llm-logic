            "content": "Explanation: The sentence \"The plonk must be wibble and it must be wibble\" is a bit redundant, but it clearly states that \"the plonk\" must be \"wibble\" in two instances. The proposed inference \"The plonk must be wibble and wibble\" is essentially saying the same thing, but in a more condensed form. The inference maintains the original meaning that \"the plonk\" must be \"wibble\" in two instances, just without the repetition of \"it must be\". Therefore, we can infer the proposed sentence from the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
