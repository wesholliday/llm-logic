It tells us that if a certain condition is met (the cake being chocolate), then a certain outcome is guaranteed (the muffins being blueberry).\n\nThe second statement, 'The muffins might not have been blueberry', tells us that it's possible that the outcome mentioned in the first statement didn't occur.\n\nIf we know that the outcome (the muffins being blueberry) didn't necessarily occur, then we can infer that the condition that would guarantee that outcome (the cake being chocolate) didn't occur either. This is because, according to the first statement, if the cake was chocolate, the muffins being blueberry would be a certainty, not just a possibility.\n\nTherefore, if it's possible that the muffins weren't blueberry, then the cake couldn't have been chocolate. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
