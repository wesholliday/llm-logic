It tells us that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is definitely metal. \n\nThe second statement, \"The truck might not have been metal,\" introduces some uncertainty about the material of the truck. However, it does not definitively state that the truck was not metal. It only suggests that there is a possibility that the truck was not metal.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that the doll was not plastic. The second statement does not contradict the first statement because it does not definitively state that the truck was not metal. Therefore, it is still possible that the doll was plastic and the truck was metal, in accordance with the first statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
