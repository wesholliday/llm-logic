This means that Mary's presence at the wedding guarantees Sue's presence. The second statement introduces a possibility: Sue might not have been at the wedding. If we combine these two statements, we can infer that if there's a chance Sue wasn't at the wedding, then Mary couldn't have been there either. This is because, according to the first statement, if Mary was there, Sue had to be there. So if there's a chance Sue wasn't there, Mary couldn't have been there. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
