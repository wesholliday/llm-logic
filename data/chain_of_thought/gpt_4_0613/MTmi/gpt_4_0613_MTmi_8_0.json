            "content": "The first statement establishes a condition: if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. This is a conditional statement, and it implies that the vampire being awake is a sufficient condition for the mummy being awake. \n\nThe second statement introduces a possibility: the mummy might not have been awake. This does not contradict the first statement, because the first statement does not say that the mummy must always be awake. It only says that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is awake. \n\nHowever, if we know that the mummy might not have been awake, then we can infer that the vampire was not awake. This is because if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake, according to the first statement. So if there is a possibility that the mummy was not awake, then the vampire could not have been awake. \n\nTherefore, from 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake' together with 'The mummy might not have been awake', we can infer 'The vampire was not awake'. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
