The second statement introduces a possibility that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. If we assume that the first statement is true, then the only way for the second statement to also be true is if Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is because if Lisa did buy the red shirt, according to the first statement, Mark must have bought the blue shirt, which contradicts the second statement. Therefore, if both statements are true, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
