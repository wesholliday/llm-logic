            "content": "The statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow' is a conditional statement. It means that if the first part (the apple being red) is true, then the second part (the banana being yellow) must also be true. However, it does not necessarily mean that if the second part is not true (the banana might not have been yellow), then the first part (the apple was red) must also be not true. This is a common logical fallacy known as denying the consequent. Therefore, from the statements 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow' and 'The banana might not have been yellow', we cannot infer 'The apple was not red'.\n\nAnswer: no",
