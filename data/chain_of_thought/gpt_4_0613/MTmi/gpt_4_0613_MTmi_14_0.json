            "content": "The first statement is a conditional statement, saying that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. This means that the presence of the bear in the cave guarantees the presence of the wolf in the den. However, it does not mean that the wolf can only be in the den if the bear is in the cave. The wolf could be in the den for other reasons, or it might not be in the den at all.\n\nThe second statement says that the wolf might not have been in the den. This does not contradict the first statement, because the first statement does not guarantee that the wolf is always in the den. It only guarantees that the wolf is in the den if the bear is in the cave.\n\nTherefore, from these two statements, we cannot infer that the bear was not in the cave. The bear could have been in the cave, and the wolf might not have been in the den for some other reason. Or the bear might not have been in the cave, and the wolf might not have been in the den because of that. We simply do not have enough information to make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
