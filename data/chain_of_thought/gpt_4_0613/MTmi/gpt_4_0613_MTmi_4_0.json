The second statement introduces a possibility that the robot might not have visited Jupiter. If we assume that the first statement is true, then the only way the second statement could also be true is if the alien did not visit Mars. This is because if the alien did visit Mars, then according to the first statement, the robot must have visited Jupiter, which contradicts the second statement. Therefore, if both statements are true, we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
