            "content": "The statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball' implies that Jen watching basketball is a necessary condition for Tom watching football. In other words, if Tom watched football, it is certain that Jen watched basketball.\n\nThe statement 'Jen might not have watched basketball' introduces a possibility that Jen did not watch basketball. \n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can infer that since there is a possibility that Jen did not watch basketball, then there is a possibility that Tom did not watch football. However, this does not necessarily mean that Tom definitely did not watch football. It only suggests a possibility, not a certainty. \n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer 'Tom did not watch football' from these two statements. \n\nAnswer: No",
