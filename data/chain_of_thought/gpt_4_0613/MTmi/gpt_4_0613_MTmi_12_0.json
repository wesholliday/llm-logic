This means that Joe's going to the park is a sufficient condition for Lucy's going to the zoo. However, it does not mean that Lucy's not going to the zoo is a sufficient condition for Joe's not going to the park. The second statement only tells us that it's possible that Lucy did not go to the zoo, but it does not confirm whether she actually went or not. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer from these two statements that Joe did not go to the park. \n\nAnswer: no",
