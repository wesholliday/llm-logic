This implies that the presence of the griffin guarantees the presence of the unicorn. \n\nThe second statement introduces the possibility that the unicorn might not have been in the forest. \n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can infer that if the unicorn might not have been in the forest, then the griffin could not have been in the forest. This is because if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest, according to the first statement. \n\nTherefore, if there is a possibility that the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin could not have been in the forest, because if the griffin was there, the unicorn would have to be there too. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
