It tells us that if a certain condition (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then another condition (Amy playing tennis) must also be true. \n\nThe second statement, 'Amy might not have played tennis', introduces some uncertainty about whether Amy played tennis or not. However, it does not definitively say that Amy did not play tennis. \n\nIf we knew for certain that Amy did not play tennis, then we could infer that Jeff did not play basketball, because according to the first statement, if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. But since we only know that Amy might not have played tennis, we cannot definitively infer that Jeff did not play basketball. \n\nAnswer: No",
