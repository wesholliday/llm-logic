It tells us that if a certain condition is met (the shirt being cotton), then another condition must also be met (the pants being denim). \n\nThe second statement, \"The pants might not have been denim,\" introduces some uncertainty about whether the second condition was met. However, it does not definitively say that the pants were not denim. \n\nIn order to infer \"The shirt was not cotton\" from these two statements, we would need to know for certain that the pants were not denim. Since the second statement only suggests that the pants might not have been denim, we cannot definitively infer that the shirt was not cotton. \n\nTherefore, the answer is no. \n\nAnswer: no.",
