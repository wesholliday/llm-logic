It tells us that if the car was red, then the truck had to be blue. However, it doesn't tell us what happens if the car was not red.\n\nThe second statement, \"The truck might not have been blue,\" introduces some uncertainty. It doesn't definitively say that the truck was not blue, only that it might not have been.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that the car was not red. The car could have been red and the truck blue, or the car could have been red and the truck not blue. The second statement only introduces a possibility, not a certainty.\n\nAnswer: No",
