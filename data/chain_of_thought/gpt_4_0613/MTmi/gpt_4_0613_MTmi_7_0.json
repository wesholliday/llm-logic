In other words, if Alex finishes, Chris also finishes. \n\nThe second statement, \"Chris might not have finished the race,\" introduces a possibility that Chris did not finish the race. \n\nGiven these two statements, if it is possible that Chris did not finish the race, then it must also be possible that Alex did not finish the race. This is because, according to the first statement, if Alex had finished, Chris would have also finished. Therefore, if there's a chance that Chris did not finish, Alex could not have finished. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
