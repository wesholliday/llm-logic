The second statement tells us that the book might not be a mystery novel. This means that there is a possibility that the book is not a mystery novel. If we combine these two statements, we can infer that if the book is not a mystery novel, then it was not written by James. This is because all books written by James are mystery novels, so if a book is not a mystery novel, it cannot have been written by James. Therefore, we can infer 'The book was not written by James' from these two statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
