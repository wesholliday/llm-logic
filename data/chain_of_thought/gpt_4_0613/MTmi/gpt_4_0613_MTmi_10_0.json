It tells us that if the dog was inside, then it is certain that the cat was outside. \n\nThe second statement, 'The cat might not have been outside', introduces a possibility that the cat was not outside. \n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can infer that if there is a possibility that the cat was not outside, then it must be the case that the dog was not inside. This is because the first statement tells us that if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside. So, if there is any chance that the cat was not outside, then the dog could not have been inside. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
