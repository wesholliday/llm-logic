            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The quibble must be froodle quank' asserts that the quibble is definitely 'froodle quank'. The second statement 'The quibble must be froodle quank or frazzle fribble' is a disjunction, meaning that the quibble could be either 'froodle quank' or 'frazzle fribble'. Since the first statement has already established that the quibble is 'froodle quank', it fits within the possibilities of the second statement. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
