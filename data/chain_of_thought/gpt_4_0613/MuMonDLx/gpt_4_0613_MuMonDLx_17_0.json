If we add an 'or zizz' to the end of the statement, it doesn't change the fact that the blimple is gribble. The 'or zizz' simply adds another possibility, but it doesn't negate the fact that the blimple is gribble. Therefore, if the blimple must be gribble, it must also be true that the blimple must be gribble or zizz.\n\nAnswer: yes",
