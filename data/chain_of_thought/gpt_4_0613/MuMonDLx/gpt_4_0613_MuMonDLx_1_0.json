The addition of 'or wobble' to the end of the statement creates an inclusive disjunction, meaning that either 'The floob must be snizzle a quank' or 'wobble' could be true, or both could be true. Since the original statement is already asserted to be true, the extended statement is also true because it includes the original statement as one of its possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes",
