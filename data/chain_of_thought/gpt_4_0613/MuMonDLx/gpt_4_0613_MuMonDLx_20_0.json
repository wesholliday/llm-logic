The second statement 'The wozzle must be floob or glorp' is a disjunction, meaning that the wozzle could be either floob or glorp. Since we know from the first statement that the wozzle is floob, it fits within the parameters of the second statement. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
