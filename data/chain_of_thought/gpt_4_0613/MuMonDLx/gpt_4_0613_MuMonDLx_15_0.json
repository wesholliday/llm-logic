The second statement 'The crunk must be zooble zibber grooble or blimple blurble flibbit' is a broader statement that includes the first one as a possibility. It suggests that the crunk could be either 'zooble zibber grooble' or 'blimple blurble flibbit'. Since the first statement is included in the second one, we can infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
