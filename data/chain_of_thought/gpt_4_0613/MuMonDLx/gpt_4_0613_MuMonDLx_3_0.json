The statement 'The zibber must be in the floob or on the floob' suggests two possibilities for the location of the zibber: it could either be within the floob or on the surface of the floob. Since the first statement is included as one of the possibilities in the second statement, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
