This means that at least one of these two items, salad or soup, was included in the meal. The rephrased statement is saying the same thing, just in a slightly different way. It's saying that the meal must have included a salad, or alternatively, it must have included soup. Both statements are expressing the same requirement: that either a salad or a soup was included in the meal.\n\nAnswer: yes",
