This means that the product could have been one of these two things, or possibly both. The second statement is essentially saying the same thing, but it's just phrased differently. It's still saying that the product must have been either eco-friendly or recyclable. Therefore, the second statement can be inferred from the first one because they both convey the same meaning.\n\nAnswer: yes",
