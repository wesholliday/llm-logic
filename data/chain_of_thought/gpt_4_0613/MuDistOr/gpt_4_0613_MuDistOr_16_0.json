            "content": "Explanation: The original statement says that the contract must have been approved by either the legal team or the CEO. This means that one of these two parties must have given their approval. The rephrased statement essentially says the same thing, but it breaks it down into two separate statements: one saying the contract must have been approved by the legal team, and the other saying it must have been approved by the CEO. However, the use of 'or' in both statements indicates that it's not necessary for both parties to give their approval, only one or the other. Therefore, the rephrased statement is a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
