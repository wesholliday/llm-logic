This means that the candidate needs to have either one of these qualifications. The rephrased statement is saying the same thing, just in a slightly different way. It is still saying that the candidate needs to have either a degree or relevant work experience. Therefore, the rephrased statement is a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
