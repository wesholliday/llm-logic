            "content": "Explanation: The original statement says that the payment must have been made by either credit card or bank transfer. This means that there are only two possible methods of payment: credit card or bank transfer. The proposed inference breaks down the original statement into two separate statements, each stating that the payment must have been made by one of the two methods. This is essentially the same as the original statement, just expressed in a different way. Therefore, we can infer the proposed statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
