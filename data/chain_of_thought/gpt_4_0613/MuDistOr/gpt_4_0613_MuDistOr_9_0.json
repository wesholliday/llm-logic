            "content": "Explanation: The original statement says that the package must have been delivered by either truck or plane. This means that there are only two possibilities for the method of delivery: truck or plane. The proposed inference is essentially restating the original statement, just in a slightly different format. It still maintains that the package must have been delivered by either truck or plane, which is consistent with the original statement. Therefore, we can infer the proposed statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
