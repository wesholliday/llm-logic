This means that there are only two possibilities for the format of the exam: it was either multiple choice or it was essay-based. The second statement is essentially saying the same thing, but it's just phrased differently. It's still saying that the exam must have been one of those two formats. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first one because they both convey the same meaning.\n\nAnswer: yes",
