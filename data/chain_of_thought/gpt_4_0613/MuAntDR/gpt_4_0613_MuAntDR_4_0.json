It could have either been held at 2 PM or it could have been cancelled. However, this statement does not definitively state that the meeting was cancelled. It only presents cancellation as one of two possible outcomes. Therefore, we cannot infer from this statement alone that 'The meeting must have been cancelled'.\n\nAnswer: No",
