            "content": "Explanation: The original statement says that the package might arrive on Monday or it might arrive on Tuesday. This means that the package will arrive on one of these two days, but not necessarily both. The proposed inference, however, suggests that the package might arrive on both Monday and Tuesday, which is not stated or implied in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the proposed statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: No",
