            "content": "Explanation: The original statement says that the concert might feature rock or it might feature jazz music. This means that either genre could potentially be featured, but it does not necessarily mean that both will be featured at the same time. The proposed inference suggests that both rock and jazz music might be featured, which is not explicitly stated in the original sentence. The original sentence implies an either/or situation, not a both/and situation.\n\nAnswer: No",
