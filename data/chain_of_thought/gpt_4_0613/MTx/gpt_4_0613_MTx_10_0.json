The second statement tells us that Q is false, or \"the wug was not garpled\". \n\nIn logic, if we know that \"If P, then Q\" is true and we also know that Q is false, we can infer that P must also be false. This is known as modus tollens. \n\nSo, if we know that \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" and we also know that \"The wug was not garpled\", we can infer that \"The wug was not sproinged\". \n\nAnswer: Yes",
