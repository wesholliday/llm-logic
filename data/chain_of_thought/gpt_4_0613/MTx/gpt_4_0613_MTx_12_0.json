The smip did not lup the zoint.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\". Here, P is \"the smip was shripped\" and Q is \"the smip lupped the zoint\".\n\nThe second statement tells us that Q is false.\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\", and we know that Q is false, we can infer that P is also false. This is known as the principle of contraposition.\n\nSo, if \"the smip lupped the zoint\" is false, then \"the smip was shripped\" must also be false.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
