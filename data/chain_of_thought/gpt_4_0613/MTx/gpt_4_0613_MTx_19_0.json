In this case, P is \"the smonk was vreebled\" and Q is \"the smonk plagged\". \n\nThe second statement tells us that Q is false, i.e., \"the smonk did not plagged\". \n\nIn logic, if we have an implication \"If P, then Q\", and we know that Q is false, we can infer that P is also false. This is because the only way for the implication to be true when Q is false is if P is also false. \n\nTherefore, if \"the smonk did not plagged\" (Q is false), we can infer that \"the smonk was not vreebled\" (P is false). \n\nAnswer: Yes",
