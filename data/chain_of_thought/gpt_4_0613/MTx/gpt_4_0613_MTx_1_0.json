The flugel was not zargled.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\". In this case, P is \"the flugel was blimmed\" and Q is \"the flugel was zargled\".\n\nThe second statement tells us that Q is false.\n\nIn logic, if we know that \"If P, then Q\" is true and Q is false, we can infer that P must also be false. This is known as modus tollens.\n\nSo, if the flugel was not zargled (Q is false), then the flugel was not blimmed (P is false).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
