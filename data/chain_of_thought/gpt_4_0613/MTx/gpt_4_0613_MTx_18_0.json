This is a classic example of Modus Tollens in logic, which states that if we have a conditional statement (if P then Q) and we know that Q is false, then we can infer that P is also false. Here, 'the shank was plooked' is P and 'the shank was nugged' is Q. Since we know that Q is false (the shank was not nugged), we can infer that P is also false (the shank was not plooked). \n\nAnswer: Yes",
