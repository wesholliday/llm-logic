            "content": "The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\". In this case, P is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and Q is \"the sprocket was daggled\". The second statement tells us that Q is false, or \"the sprocket was not daggled\". \n\nIn logic, if we know that \"If P, then Q\" is true and we also know that Q is false, we can infer that P is also false. This is known as modus tollens. \n\nSo, if we know that \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" and \"The sprocket was not daggled\", we can infer that \"The sprocket was not cranked\". \n\nAnswer: Yes",
