The first statement is \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" (If P, then Q) and the second statement is \"The sneg did not sproted the frink\" (Not Q). \n\nIn logic, if we have an implication \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false (Not Q), then we can infer that P is also false (Not P). This is known as Modus Tollens. \n\nApplying this to the given statements, if \"the sneg was crampled\" leads to \"the sneg sproted the frink\", and we know that \"the sneg did not sproted the frink\", then we can infer that \"the sneg was not crampled\". \n\nAnswer: Yes",
