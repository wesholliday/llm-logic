The twonk was not varnished.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\". In this case, P is \"the twonk was plinked\" and Q is \"it was varnished\". \n\nThe second statement tells us that Q is false, i.e., the twonk was not varnished.\n\nIn logic, if we know that \"If P, then Q\" is true and Q is false, we can infer that P is also false. This is known as the principle of contraposition. \n\nSo, if the twonk was not varnished (Q is false), then it must be the case that the twonk was not plinked (P is false).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
