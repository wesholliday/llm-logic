In this case, P is \"the whiffle was shanked\" and Q is \"the whiffle tinked\". \n\nThe second statement tells us that Q is false, or \"the whiffle did not tink\". \n\nAccording to the rules of logic, if \"If P, then Q\" is true and Q is false, then P must also be false. This is known as modus tollens. \n\nTherefore, if \"the whiffle was shanked\" leads to \"the whiffle tinked\", and we know that \"the whiffle did not tink\", we can infer that \"the whiffle was not shanked\". \n\nAnswer: Yes",
