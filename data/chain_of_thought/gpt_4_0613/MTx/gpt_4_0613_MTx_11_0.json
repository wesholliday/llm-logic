This means that if the flug was blummed, it must have been zimmed. \n\nHowever, we know from the second statement that 'The flug was not zimmed'. If being 'blummed' necessarily leads to being 'zimmed', and we know that the flug was not 'zimmed', then it must be the case that the flug was not 'blummed'. If it had been 'blummed', it would have been 'zimmed', which contradicts the information we have. \n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The flug was not blummed'. \n\nAnswer: yes",
