In this statement, 'the glip was slogged' is the hypothesis and 'the glip was tragged' is the conclusion. \n\nThe second statement 'The glip was not tragged' negates the conclusion of the first statement. \n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement and we know that the conclusion is false, then we can infer that the hypothesis is also false. This is known as modus tollens. \n\nSo, if 'the glip was tragged' is false (as stated in the second statement), then 'the glip was slogged' must also be false. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
