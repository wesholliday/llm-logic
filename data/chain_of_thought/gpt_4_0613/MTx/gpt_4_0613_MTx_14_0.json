Modus Tollens is a valid form of argument that says if we have a conditional statement (if P then Q) and we know that Q is false, then we can infer that P is also false. Here, 'the clug was fleeked' is P and 'the clug snugged' is Q. We know that Q is false (the clug did not snugged), so according to Modus Tollens, P (the clug was fleeked) must also be false. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
