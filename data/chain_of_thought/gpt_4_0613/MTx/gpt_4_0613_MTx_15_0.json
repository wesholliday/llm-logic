In this case, P is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and Q is \"the dreb was spened\". \n\nThe second statement tells us that Q is false, i.e., \"the dreb was not spened\". \n\nIn logic, if we have a situation where \"If P then Q\" is true and Q is false, then P must also be false. This is because the only way for the implication to hold true is if P is false when Q is false. \n\nTherefore, if \"the dreb was vroombed\" leads to \"the dreb was spened\", and we know that \"the dreb was not spened\", then we can infer that \"the dreb was not vroombed\". \n\nAnswer: Yes",
