In this case, P is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and Q is \"the fribble crinked\". \n\nThe second statement tells us that Q is false, or \"the fribble did not crink\". \n\nIn logic, if we know that \"If P, then Q\" is true and Q is false, we can infer that P is also false. This is known as modus tollens. \n\nSo, if we know that \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\" is true and \"the fribble did not crink\" is also true, we can infer that \"the fribble was not snurgled\". \n\nAnswer: Yes",
