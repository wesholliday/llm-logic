The second statement tells us that the outcome (the fleeg surning) did not occur. \n\nIn logic, this is a situation of Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (if P then Q) and we know that Q is false, then we can infer that P is also false. \n\nIn this case, P is 'the fleeg was bluttered' and Q is 'it surned'. The second statement tells us that Q is false (the fleeg did not surn). Therefore, we can infer that P is also false (the fleeg was not bluttered). \n\nAnswer: Yes",
