The second statement tells us that the splat did not quank. If we know that morphing always leads to quanking, and we know that there was no quanking, then we can infer that there was no morphing. If there had been morphing, there would have been quanking, which contradicts the information we have. Therefore, we can infer that the splat was not morphed. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
