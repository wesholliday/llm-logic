In this case, P is \"the zinger was fraggled\" and Q is \"the zinger was smoogled\". \n\nThe second statement tells us that Q is false, i.e., \"the zinger was not smoogled\". \n\nIn logic, if we know that \"If P, then Q\" is true and Q is false, we can infer that P is also false. This is known as the principle of contraposition. \n\nSo, if \"the zinger was smoogled\" is false, then \"the zinger was fraggled\" must also be false, according to the given implication. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
