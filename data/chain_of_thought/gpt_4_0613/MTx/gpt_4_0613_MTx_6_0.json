The second statement tells us that the second event (the grommet plopped the frink) did not happen. \n\nIn logic, this is a form of modus tollens, a valid form of argument where if the consequent is known to be false, then the antecedent must also be false. In this case, the consequent is 'the grommet plopped the frink' and the antecedent is 'the grommet was sploffed'. Since we know the consequent is false (the grommet did not plop the frink), we can infer that the antecedent is also false (the grommet was not sploffed).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
