In this case, P is \"the flob was skizzled\" and Q is \"the flob movated\". \n\nThe second statement tells us that Q is false, i.e., \"the flob did not movate\". \n\nIn logic, if we have an implication \"If P, then Q\", and we know that Q is false, we can infer that P is also false. This is known as the principle of modus tollens. \n\nSo, in this case, if \"the flob movated\" is false, we can infer that \"the flob was skizzled\" is also false. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
