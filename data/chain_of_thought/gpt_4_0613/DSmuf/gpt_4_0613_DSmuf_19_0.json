The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities: it is not the case that the watch must be on his wrist. Given that these are the only two possibilities presented, and one has been eliminated, we can infer that the other must be the case. Therefore, the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
