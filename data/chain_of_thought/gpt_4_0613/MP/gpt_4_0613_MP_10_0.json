The second statement confirms the condition of the first statement, that the dog was inside. Therefore, according to the rules of logic, if the condition of a conditional statement is met, then the result of that condition must also be true. In this case, if the dog was inside (which we know to be true), then the cat was outside. Therefore, we can infer that the cat was outside. \n\nAnswer: yes",
