This means that the mummy being awake is a necessary condition for the vampire being awake. The second statement confirms that the vampire was indeed awake. Given these two pieces of information, we can infer that the mummy must have been awake as well, because the first statement tells us that the vampire being awake implies the mummy being awake. \n\nAnswer: yes",
