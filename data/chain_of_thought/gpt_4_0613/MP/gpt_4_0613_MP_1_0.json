            "content": "The first statement is a conditional statement that says if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. The second statement confirms that Mary was indeed at the wedding. According to the rules of logic, if a conditional statement is true and its first part (the \"if\" part) is also true, then its second part (the \"then\" part) must also be true. Therefore, if it's true that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding, and it's also true that Mary was at the wedding, we can infer that Sue was at the wedding. \n\nAnswer: yes",
