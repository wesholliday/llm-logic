The second statement confirms that the first event (the alien visiting Mars) did indeed happen. According to the rules of logic, if a conditional statement is true and its first part (the \"if\" part) is true, then its second part (the \"then\" part) must also be true. Therefore, we can infer that the robot visited Jupiter. \n\nAnswer: yes",
