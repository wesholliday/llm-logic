The second statement confirms the condition of the first statement, that Sue did indeed choose pizza. Therefore, according to the rules of logic, if the condition of a conditional statement is met, then the result of that condition must also be true. In this case, if Sue chose pizza (which she did), then Bob chose pasta. Therefore, we can infer that Bob chose pasta. \n\nAnswer: yes",
