The second statement confirms that the first event (Sam taking a plane) did indeed happen. According to the rules of logic, if a conditional statement is true and the first part of the condition (the \"if\" part) is true, then the second part of the condition (the \"then\" part) must also be true. Therefore, if it's true that Sam took a plane, then it must also be true that Erin took a train. \n\nAnswer: yes",
