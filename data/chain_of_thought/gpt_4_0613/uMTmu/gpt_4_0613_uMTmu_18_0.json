In this case, P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck must have been metal\". The second sentence states that it's not the case that Q, meaning Q is false. According to the rules of logic, if \"If P, then Q\" is true and Q is false, then P must also be false. Therefore, we can infer that the doll was not plastic. \n\nAnswer: yes",
