The second statement contradicts the condition of the first statement by saying that it's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta. If we accept both statements as true, then the only logical conclusion is that the condition for the first statement (Sue choosing pizza) did not occur. This is because if Sue had chosen pizza, then according to the first statement, Bob would have to choose pasta, which contradicts the second statement. Therefore, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza. \n\nAnswer: yes",
