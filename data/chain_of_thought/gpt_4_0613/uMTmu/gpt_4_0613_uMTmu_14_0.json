In this case, P is \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q is \"the wolf must have been in the den\". The second sentence tells us that Q is not true. According to the rules of logic, if \"If P, then Q\" is true and Q is not true, then P must also not be true. Therefore, if the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
