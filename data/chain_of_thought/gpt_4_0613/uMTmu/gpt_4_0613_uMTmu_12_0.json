The second statement contradicts the condition of the first statement by saying that it's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This contradiction implies that the condition for the first statement to be true (Joe going to the park) did not occur. Therefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
