In this case, P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana must have been yellow\". \n\nThe second sentence states that it's not the case that Q is true, meaning \"the banana must have been yellow\" is false. \n\nIn logic, if \"If P, then Q\" is true and Q is false, then P must also be false. This is known as Modus Tollens, a valid form of argument in logic. \n\nSo, if \"the banana must have been yellow\" is false, then \"the apple was red\" must also be false. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
