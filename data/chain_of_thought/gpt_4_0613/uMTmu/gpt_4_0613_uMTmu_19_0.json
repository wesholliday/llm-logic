The statement also tells us that Q is false, meaning \"Jen did not watch basketball\". In a conditional statement, if Q is false, then P must also be false. This is because the original statement tells us that P leads to Q, so if Q didn't happen, P couldn't have happened. Therefore, if Jen did not watch basketball, Tom did not watch football. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
