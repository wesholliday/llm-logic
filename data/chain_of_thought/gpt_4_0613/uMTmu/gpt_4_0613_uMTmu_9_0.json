This is a conditional statement, and it implies that Lisa buying the red shirt necessitates Mark buying the blue shirt.\n\nThe second statement contradicts the condition that follows from Lisa buying the red shirt: it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. \n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that the condition for Lisa buying the red shirt (which is Mark buying the blue shirt) is not met. Therefore, Lisa did not buy the red shirt. \n\nAnswer: yes",
