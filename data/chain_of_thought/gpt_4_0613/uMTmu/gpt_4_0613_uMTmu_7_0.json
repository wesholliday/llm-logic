This means that Alex finishing the race is a sufficient condition for Chris finishing the race. \n\nThe second statement tells us that it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race. This means that the condition for Chris finishing the race (which is Alex finishing the race) did not occur. \n\nTherefore, based on these two statements, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
