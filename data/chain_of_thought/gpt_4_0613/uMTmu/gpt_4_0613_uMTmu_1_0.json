The second statement contradicts the condition of the first statement by saying that it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This contradiction implies that the condition for Mary being at the wedding (which is Sue being at the wedding) did not occur. Therefore, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding. \n\nAnswer: yes",
