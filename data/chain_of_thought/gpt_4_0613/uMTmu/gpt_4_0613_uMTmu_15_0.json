The second statement contradicts the condition of the first statement by saying that it's not the case that Erin must have taken a train. This contradiction implies that the condition for the first statement to be true (Sam taking a plane) did not occur. Therefore, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane. \n\nAnswer: yes",
