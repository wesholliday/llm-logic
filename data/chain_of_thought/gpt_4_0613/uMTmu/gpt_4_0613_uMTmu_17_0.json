The second statement contradicts the condition of the first statement by saying that it's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad. If we accept both statements as true, then the only logical conclusion is that the condition for the first statement (Ben eating pasta) did not occur. If it had occurred, then Kate would have had to eat salad, which contradicts the second statement. Therefore, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta. \n\nAnswer: yes",
