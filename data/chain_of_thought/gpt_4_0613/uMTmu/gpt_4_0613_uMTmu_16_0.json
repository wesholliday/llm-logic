The second statement contradicts this by saying that it's not the case that the pants must have been denim. This contradiction implies that the initial condition (the shirt being cotton) did not occur. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants would have to be denim, but since the pants are not denim, the shirt could not have been cotton. Therefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton. \n\nAnswer: yes",
