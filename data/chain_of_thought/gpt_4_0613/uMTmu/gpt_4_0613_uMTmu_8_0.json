This means that the vampire being awake necessitates the mummy being awake. \n\nThe second statement tells us that it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake. This contradicts the condition that would be created if the vampire were awake. \n\nTherefore, given these two statements, we can infer that the vampire was not awake. If the vampire were awake, it would create a condition (the mummy being awake) that we know did not occur. \n\nAnswer: yes",
