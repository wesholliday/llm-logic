The second statement contradicts the second part of the first statement, saying that it's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest. This contradiction implies that the condition for the griffin being in the forest (i.e., the unicorn being in the forest) is not met. Therefore, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest. \n\nAnswer: yes",
