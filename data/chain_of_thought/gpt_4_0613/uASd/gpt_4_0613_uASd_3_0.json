It does not provide any information about the safety of the car in the garage under abnormal circumstances, such as when the garage is flooding. Flooding can cause damage to a car, so it would not be safe in that situation. Therefore, we cannot infer that the car is safe if the garage is flooding. \n\nAnswer: No",
