The pilot light being on or off does not change the fact that the oven is on. Therefore, the condition of the pilot light does not affect the warmth of the kitchen. The only condition given for the kitchen being warm is that the oven is on. So, if the oven is on, regardless of the state of the pilot light, the kitchen should be warm according to the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
