However, it does not provide any information about the possibility of failure. The statement 'The project might fail or be successful' implies that there are two possibilities - success or failure. Since the possibility of success is already established in the first statement, and the possibility of failure is inherently present in any situation where success is not guaranteed, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
