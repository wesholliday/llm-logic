The statement 'The package might be delayed or delivered' also implies that there is a possibility of the package being delivered, but it also includes the possibility of the package being delayed. Therefore, the second statement is a broader version of the first one, including all the possibilities of the first statement and adding one more. So, if the first statement is true, the second statement is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
