The statement 'The book might be in the drawer or on the shelf' also includes the possibility of the book being on the shelf, but adds another possible location - the drawer. Since the second statement includes all the possibilities of the first one and potentially more, we can infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
