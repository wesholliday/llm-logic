However, it does not explicitly state the possibility of the team losing. But in any competitive game, there are generally two outcomes: win or lose. So, if there is a possibility to win, there is also inherently a possibility to lose. Therefore, we can infer from the original statement that \"The team might lose or win the game.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
