The statement 'The movie might be boring or interesting' is a broader statement that includes the possibility of the movie being interesting, but also includes the possibility of it being boring. Since the first statement does not exclude the possibility of the movie being boring, it can be inferred that 'The movie might be boring or interesting' from 'The movie might be interesting'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
