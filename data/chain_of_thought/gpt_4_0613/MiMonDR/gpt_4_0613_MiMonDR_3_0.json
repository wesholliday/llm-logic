The statement 'The keys might be in the house or in the car' suggests that there is a possibility that the keys are either in the house or in the car. Since the first statement already establishes the possibility of the keys being in the car, it is included in the second statement which adds another possible location - the house. Therefore, the first statement can be inferred from the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
