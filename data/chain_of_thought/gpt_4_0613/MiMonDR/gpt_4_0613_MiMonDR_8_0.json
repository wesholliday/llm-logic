The statement 'The flowers might be yellow or red' implies that there is a possibility that the flowers are either yellow or red. Since the possibility of the flowers being red is included in both statements, we can infer 'The flowers might be yellow or red' from 'The flowers might be red'. This is because the second statement is not excluding the possibility of the flowers being red, but rather adding another possible color, yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
