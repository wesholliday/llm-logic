The second statement is a conditional statement, where the condition is 'the vampire was awake'. However, we know from the first statement that this condition is not met, as the vampire was not awake. Therefore, the second statement does not provide any information about whether the mummy was awake or not when the vampire was not awake. We cannot infer anything about the mummy's state from the given statements. \n\nAnswer: No",
