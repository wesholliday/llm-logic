It tells us that the robot visiting Jupiter is a consequence of the alien visiting Mars. However, it does not tell us what happens if the alien did not visit Mars. The robot could have visited Jupiter for other reasons. Therefore, from the statement 'The alien did not visit Mars', we cannot infer 'The robot did not visit Jupiter'. \n\nAnswer: No",
