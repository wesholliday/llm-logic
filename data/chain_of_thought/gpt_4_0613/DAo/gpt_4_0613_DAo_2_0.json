However, the second statement does not tell us anything about where the unicorn might be if the griffin is not in the forest. Therefore, we cannot infer from these two statements alone that the unicorn was not in the forest. The unicorn could be in the forest or not, regardless of the griffin's location. \n\nAnswer: No",
