However, we know from the first statement that Sam did not take a plane. This means that the condition for the second statement is not met. However, this does not give us any information about whether Erin took a train or not. Erin could have taken a train for some other reason, or she could have not taken a train. We simply do not have enough information to infer anything about Erin's mode of transportation. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Erin did not take a train' from these statements. \n\nAnswer: No",
