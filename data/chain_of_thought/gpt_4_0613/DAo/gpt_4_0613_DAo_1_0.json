The second statement is a conditional statement that tells us about a situation where Mary is at the wedding. However, the first statement tells us that this situation did not occur - Mary was not at the wedding. Therefore, the conditional statement does not provide us with any information about whether Sue was at the wedding or not. We cannot infer anything about Sue's presence at the wedding from these statements. \n\nAnswer: No",
