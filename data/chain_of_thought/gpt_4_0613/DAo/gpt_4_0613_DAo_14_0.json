The question is asking if we can infer 'The wolf was not in the den' from these statements.\n\nThe first statement tells us about the location of the bear. The bear was not in the cave.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if a certain condition is met (the bear is in the cave), then a certain outcome will occur (the wolf is in the den). However, we know from the first statement that the condition (the bear being in the cave) is not met. \n\nHowever, the second statement does not tell us what happens if the condition is not met. It does not tell us where the wolf is if the bear is not in the cave. Therefore, we cannot infer from these statements that 'The wolf was not in the den'. The wolf could be in the den or not, the statements do not provide enough information to determine this.\n\nAnswer: No",
