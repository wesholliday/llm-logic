However, we know from the first statement that 'Sue did not choose pizza'. This means the condition for the second statement is not met. Therefore, the second statement does not provide any information about what Bob chose in this case. It is possible that Bob chose pasta even though Sue did not choose pizza. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Bob did not choose pasta' from these statements. \n\nAnswer: No",
