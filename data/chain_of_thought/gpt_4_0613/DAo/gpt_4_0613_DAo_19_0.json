            "content": "The statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' is a conditional statement. It tells us what would happen if Tom watched football. However, we know from the first statement that Tom did not watch football. This means that the condition for the second statement is not met. However, this does not necessarily mean that Jen did not watch basketball. Jen could have watched basketball for other reasons, not related to whether Tom watched football or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'Jen did not watch basketball' based on the given statements. \n\nAnswer: No",
