However, the second statement is a conditional statement and does not provide information about what happens if Alex does not finish the race. It does not necessarily mean that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race. Chris could have finished the race regardless of whether Alex did or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that Chris did not finish the race based on the given information. \n\nAnswer: No",
