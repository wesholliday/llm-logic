It tells us what would happen if Ben ate pasta, but it doesn't tell us what would happen if Ben did not eat pasta. In other words, it doesn't tell us anything about whether or not Kate ate salad when Ben did not eat pasta. Therefore, from the two statements 'Ben did not eat pasta' and 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad', we cannot infer 'Kate did not eat salad'. \n\nAnswer: No",
