However, we know from the first statement that 'Jeff did not play basketball'. This means the condition for the second statement is not met, so we cannot make any definitive conclusions about whether Amy played tennis or not. The statements do not provide any information about what Amy does when Jeff does not play basketball. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Amy did not play tennis' from these statements. \n\nAnswer: No",
