This is a conditional statement, and it only tells us what happens if Lisa bought the red shirt. It does not tell us what happens if Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about whether or not Mark bought the blue shirt based on these two statements. We only know that if Lisa had bought the red shirt, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt. But since Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we have no information about what Mark did or did not do. \n\nAnswer: No",
