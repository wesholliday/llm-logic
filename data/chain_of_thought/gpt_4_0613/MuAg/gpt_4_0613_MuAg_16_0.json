            "content": "Explanation: The original statement says that the room must have been cleaned daily and it must have had fresh towels. This means that there are two conditions that must have been met: the room was cleaned daily, and it had fresh towels. The proposed inference is that the room must have been cleaned daily and had fresh towels. This statement also implies that the room was cleaned daily and had fresh towels. The only difference between the two statements is the removal of the second \"must have\" in the proposed inference. However, this does not change the meaning of the statement, as the \"must have\" still applies to both conditions. Therefore, we can infer the proposed statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
