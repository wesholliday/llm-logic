The first sentence says \"The contract must have been valid for a year and it must have been renewable\" and the second sentence says \"The contract must have been valid for a year and been renewable\". The only difference is the removal of the second \"it must have\" in the second sentence, which is grammatically acceptable and does not change the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, we can infer the second sentence from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
