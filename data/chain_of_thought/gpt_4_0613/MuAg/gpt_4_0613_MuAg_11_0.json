This means that two actions have taken place: an update and a restart. The proposed inference, 'The software must have been updated and restarted', is essentially saying the same thing. It's just a more concise way of expressing the two actions that have taken place. Therefore, we can infer the proposed statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
