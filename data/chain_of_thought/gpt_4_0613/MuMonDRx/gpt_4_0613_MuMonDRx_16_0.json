The second statement 'The plonk must be quimble flonk or flimble zibber' suggests that the plonk could be either quimble flonk or flimble zibber. Since the first statement has already established that the plonk is flimble zibber, it fits within the possibilities of the second statement. Therefore, the first statement does not contradict the second statement, and we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
