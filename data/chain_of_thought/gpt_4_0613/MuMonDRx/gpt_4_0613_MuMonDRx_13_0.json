The second statement 'The quimble must be zibble or in glorp' presents two possibilities for the quimble: it could either be zibble or in glorp. Since the first statement already confirmed that the quimble is in glorp, it fits within the possibilities presented in the second statement. Therefore, the first statement does not contradict the second statement, and we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
