The second statement 'The fizzle must be froodle or zizz by zooble' is a broader condition, as it includes the original condition 'zizz by zooble' and adds another possible condition 'froodle'. Therefore, the original statement does not contradict the second statement, and we can infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
