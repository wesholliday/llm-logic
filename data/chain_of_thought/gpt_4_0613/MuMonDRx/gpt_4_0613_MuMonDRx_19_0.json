The second statement 'The grooble must be in grazzle or blimp zibble' is a broader statement that includes the possibility of the grooble being blimp zibble, but also introduces another possibility of the grooble being in grazzle. Since the first statement is included in the possibilities of the second statement, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
