The second statement is essentially saying that the fizzle must be one of two things: either on an quank gribble or zazzle with gronk. Since the original statement confirms that the fizzle is indeed zazzle with gronk, it fits within the two options presented in the second statement. Therefore, the original statement does not contradict the second statement, and we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
