The second statement 'The snorkel must be quorple or glorp zizz' suggests that the snorkel could be either 'quorple' or 'glorp zizz'. Since the first statement confirms that the snorkel is 'glorp zizz', it fits within the possibilities of the second statement. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
