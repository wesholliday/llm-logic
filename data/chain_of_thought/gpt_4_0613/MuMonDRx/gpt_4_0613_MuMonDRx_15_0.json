The second statement is asking if the zazzle could be either \"zibber\" or \"wobble crunk zibber\". Since the original statement has already established that the zazzle is \"wobble crunk zibber\", it is true that the zazzle could be described as either \"wobble crunk zibber\" or \"zibber\", because \"wobble crunk zibber\" includes \"zibber\". \n\nAnswer: yes",
