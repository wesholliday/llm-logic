The statement 'The grazzle must be frazzle or wumble' suggests that the grazzle could be either a frazzle or a wumble. Since we know from the first statement that the grazzle is a wumble, it fits within the parameters of the second statement, which allows for the grazzle to be either a frazzle or a wumble. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
