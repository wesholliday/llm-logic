The second statement presents two possibilities: the sock is either under the bed or in the laundry basket. If we accept the first statement as true, then the sock is not under the bed. Given the second statement, if the sock is not under the bed, the only other option presented is that it is in the laundry basket. Therefore, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
