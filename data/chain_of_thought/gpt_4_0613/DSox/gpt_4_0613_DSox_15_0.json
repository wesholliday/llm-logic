The second statement tells us that 'Either the dreb is vroombed or it is spened'. \n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can infer that since the dreb is not spened, it must be vroombed. This is because the second statement tells us that the dreb must be one of these two things, and we know from the first statement that it is not spened. Therefore, it must be vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
