The second statement is a conditional statement that tells us if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. Since we know from the first statement that Mary was at the wedding, we can apply the condition from the second statement. This means that since Mary was at the wedding, Sue must have also been at the wedding. Therefore, we can infer that Sue was at the wedding. \n\nAnswer: yes",
