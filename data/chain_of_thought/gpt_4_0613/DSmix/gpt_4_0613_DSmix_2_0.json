The second statement introduces the possibility that the wug might not be bimmed. However, this does not guarantee that the wug is not bimmed, it only suggests that it's a possibility. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the wug is flooped based on these two statements. The wug could still be bimmed, or it could be neither flooped nor bimmed. \n\nAnswer: No",
