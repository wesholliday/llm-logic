The second statement introduces some uncertainty about the shank being nugged, but it does not definitively state that the shank is not nugged. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the shank is plooked. The shank might not be nugged, but it also might be nugged. We don't have enough information to make a definitive inference. \n\nAnswer: no",
