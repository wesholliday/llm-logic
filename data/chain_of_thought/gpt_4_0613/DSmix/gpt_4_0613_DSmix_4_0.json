The second statement introduces uncertainty about the fribble being crinked, but it does not definitively rule out the possibility. It only suggests that the fribble might not be crinked, not that it definitely isn't. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the fribble is snurgled just based on the possibility that it might not be crinked. \n\nAnswer: no",
