The second statement introduces the possibility that the sneg might not be sproted. However, this does not definitively rule out the possibility that the sneg is sproted, it only suggests that it might not be. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the sneg is crampled based on these two statements. \n\nAnswer: No",
