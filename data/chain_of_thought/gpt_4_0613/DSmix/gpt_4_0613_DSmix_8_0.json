The second statement tells us that it's possible that the sprocket is not daggled. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the sprocket is cranked. It's possible that neither condition is true, because the second statement only tells us that the sprocket might not be daggled, not that it definitely isn't. Therefore, we can't definitively infer that the sprocket is cranked based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
