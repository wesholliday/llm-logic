The second statement introduces the possibility that the flob might not be movated. However, this does not confirm that the flob is not movated, it only suggests that it's a possibility. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the flob is skizzled, because there's still a chance that it could be movated. \n\nAnswer: No",
