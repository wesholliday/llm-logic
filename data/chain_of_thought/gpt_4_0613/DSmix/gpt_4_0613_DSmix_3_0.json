The second statement introduces the possibility that the splat might not be quanked. However, this does not necessarily mean that the splat is not quanked, it just means that it's possible for it not to be. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the splat is morphed, because it's still possible that it could be quanked. \n\nAnswer: No",
