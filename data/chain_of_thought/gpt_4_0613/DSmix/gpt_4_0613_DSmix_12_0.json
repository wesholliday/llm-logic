The second statement tells us that it's possible that the smip is not lupped. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the smip is not lupped, just that it might not be. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the smip is shripped, because it's still possible that the smip is lupped. \n\nAnswer: no",
