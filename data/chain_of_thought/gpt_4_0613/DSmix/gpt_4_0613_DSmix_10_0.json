The second statement introduces uncertainty about the wug being garpled, but it does not definitively rule out the possibility. It only says that the wug might not be garpled, not that it definitely isn't. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the wug is sproinged just based on these two statements. \n\nAnswer: No",
