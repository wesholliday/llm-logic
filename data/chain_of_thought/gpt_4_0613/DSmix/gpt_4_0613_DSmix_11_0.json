However, this does not confirm that the flug is not zimmed, it only suggests that it's a possibility. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the flug is blummed. The flug could still be zimmed or it could be blummed, we don't have enough information to make a certain conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
