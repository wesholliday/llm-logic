The second statement introduces uncertainty about the glip being tragged, but it does not definitively rule out the possibility. It only says that the glip might not be tragged, not that it definitely isn't. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the glip is slogged. It might be, but it also might be tragged. \n\nAnswer: No",
