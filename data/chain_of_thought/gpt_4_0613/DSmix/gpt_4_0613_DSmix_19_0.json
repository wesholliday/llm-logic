The second statement introduces the possibility that the smonk might not be plagged. However, this does not confirm that the smonk is not plagged, it only suggests that it might not be. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the smonk is vreebled, because there is still a possibility that it could be plagged. \n\nAnswer: No",
