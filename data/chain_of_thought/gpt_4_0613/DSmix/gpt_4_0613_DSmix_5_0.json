The second statement introduces some uncertainty about the zinger being smoogled, but it does not definitively rule out the possibility. It only says that the zinger might not be smoogled, not that it definitely isn't. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the zinger is fraggled based on these two statements. \n\nAnswer: No",
