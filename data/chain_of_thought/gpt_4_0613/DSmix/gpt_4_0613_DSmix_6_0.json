The second statement introduces uncertainty about the grommet being plopped. However, it does not definitively rule out the possibility of the grommet being plopped. It only suggests that it might not be plopped. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the grommet is sploffed just based on these two statements. The grommet could still be plopped or it could be sploffed. We don't have enough information to make a definitive inference. \n\nAnswer: No",
