If the check bounces, it means that the payment for the bill has not been successfully processed, which contradicts the condition in the original statement that the bill has been paid. Therefore, we cannot infer that the services will continue if the bill is paid and the check bounces, because the condition of the bill being paid is not truly met if the check bounces. \n\nAnswer: No",
