However, this statement does not account for other potential issues with the car, such as a shot transmission. A shot transmission could prevent the car from running smoothly, regardless of whether the oil is changed or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that changing the oil will make the car run smoothly if the transmission is shot. \n\nAnswer: No",
