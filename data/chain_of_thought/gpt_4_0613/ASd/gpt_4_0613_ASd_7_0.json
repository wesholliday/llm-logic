However, the second statement adds an additional condition: the pilot light is out. The original statement does not provide any information about the state of the kitchen when the pilot light is out. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first one because we don't know how the additional condition (the pilot light being out) affects the warmth of the kitchen. \n\nAnswer: No",
