However, the second statement adds an additional condition: \"and a bomb goes off\". This new condition significantly changes the context and potential outcome of the situation. The original statement does not account for this new, dangerous condition. Therefore, we cannot infer that the outcome (having a good time) will still hold true if this new condition is met. \n\nAnswer: No",
