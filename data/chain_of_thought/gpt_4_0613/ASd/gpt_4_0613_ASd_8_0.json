However, the second statement adds an additional condition - that the package was misrouted. Misrouting a package usually leads to delays in delivery. The original statement does not account for any potential delays or problems such as misrouting. Therefore, we cannot infer that even if the package was misrouted, it will still arrive today just because it has shipped. \n\nAnswer: No",
