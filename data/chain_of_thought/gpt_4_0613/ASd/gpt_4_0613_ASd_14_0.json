Therefore, we cannot infer that the same result (passing the test) will occur if the test is in Chinese. The ability to pass a test in Chinese would depend on the person's proficiency in Chinese, which is not given in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot make this inference based on the information provided. \n\nAnswer: No",
