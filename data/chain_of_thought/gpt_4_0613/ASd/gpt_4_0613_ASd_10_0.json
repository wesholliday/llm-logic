However, it does not provide any information about the situation when the item is out of stock. It's reasonable to assume that if an item is out of stock, it cannot be shipped, regardless of whether an order is placed or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'If the order is placed and the item is out of stock, then it will ship' based on the original statement. \n\nAnswer: No",
