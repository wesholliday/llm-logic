The difficulty of an exam is not solely determined by the number of chapters it covers. It could also depend on the complexity of the questions, the depth of understanding required, the time allowed for the exam, among other factors. Therefore, we cannot infer that the exam might be difficult just because it might cover all chapters.\n\nAnswer: no",
