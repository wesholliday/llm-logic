However, it does not specify when this might happen. The inferred statement, \"The package might be delivered today and signed for,\" adds a specific time frame (today) that was not present in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first because it adds information that was not present in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
