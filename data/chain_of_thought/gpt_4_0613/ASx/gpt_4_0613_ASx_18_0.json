Adding another condition (it is blorped) to the if-clause does not change the fact that twiddling the zonk leads to it puzzling. The additional condition of being blorped is not necessary for the zonk to pluzzle, according to the original statement. Therefore, it is still true that if the zonk is twiddled (whether or not it is also blorped), it will pluzzle.\n\nAnswer: yes",
