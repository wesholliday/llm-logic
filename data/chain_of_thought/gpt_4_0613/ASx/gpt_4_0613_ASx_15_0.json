This means that the snarbling of the glunk is a sufficient condition for the floinking of the blip. \n\nThe second statement adds an additional condition - the troon being zibbled. However, the original statement did not specify that the snarbling of the glunk is the only condition for the floinking of the blip. Therefore, it is possible that the blip could still be floinked even if the troon is zibbled, as long as the glunk snarbles. \n\nSo, we can infer the second statement from the first one. The additional condition does not contradict the original statement, it simply adds more information. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
