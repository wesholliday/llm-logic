This is a cause and effect relationship where the cause is you glurping and the effect is it hurting my snarfs. The new statement adds an additional condition - I am wearing plorks. However, the original statement does not mention anything about wearing plorks. Therefore, we cannot infer from the original statement that if you glurp and I am wearing plorks, it will hurt my snarfs. The original statement only provides information about the effect of you glurping, not about the effect of you glurping while I am wearing plorks. \n\nAnswer: No",
