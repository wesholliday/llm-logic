The additional condition in the second statement, that it was misglommed, does not change the outcome of the plink tizzling, because according to the original statement, the only condition necessary for the plink to tizzle is that it has morphed. Therefore, even if the plink was misglommed, as long as it has morphed, it will tizzle.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
