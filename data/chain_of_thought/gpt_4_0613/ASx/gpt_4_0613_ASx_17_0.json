This means that the condition for the skrizzle being plonked is the glop being on the brink. The second statement adds an additional condition - the bloop is zorped. However, this additional condition doesn't change the original condition for the skrizzle being plonked. Even if the bloop is zorped, as long as the glop is on the brink, the skrizzle is plonked. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
