This means that the sploofing of the trankle is a sufficient condition for the zorple to quibble. \n\nThe second statement adds an additional condition - the drib is flanked. However, the original statement did not require any other conditions to be met for the zorple to quibble, other than the trankle being sploofed. \n\nTherefore, even with the additional condition of the drib being flanked, as long as the trankle is sploofed, the zorple will still quibble. The additional condition does not negate or change the outcome of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
