The second statement adds an additional condition - that it is bazoogled. However, the original statement does not require this additional condition for the zink to be tinking. Therefore, even if the zink is bazoogled, as long as it is in the snaffle, it will be tinking. The additional condition does not change the outcome, so we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
