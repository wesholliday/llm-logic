The new statement adds an additional condition (a wug zites) to crinking the snoogle, but it doesn't change the outcome (plooking a nurp). The original statement doesn't specify anything about what happens when a wug zites, so we can't say for sure that it would prevent us from plooking a nurp. Therefore, based on the information given, we can infer that if we crink the snoogle and a wug zites, we'll still plook a nurp.\n\nAnswer: yes",
