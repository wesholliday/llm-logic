This means that the grobbling of the plim is a sufficient condition for the splooshing of the whiffle. \n\nThe second statement adds an additional condition: the drazzle is drooped. However, since the grobbling of the plim is already sufficient for the splooshing of the whiffle, the state of the drazzle doesn't affect the outcome. Whether the drazzle is drooped or not, as long as the plim is grobbled, the whiffle will sploosh. \n\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
