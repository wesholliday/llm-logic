The additional condition in the second statement, that the sklonk is grooped, does not change the outcome of the zarp splunking as long as the frizzle is dinked. The original condition (the frizzle being dinked) is still met in the second statement, so we can infer that the zarp will still splunk.\n\nAnswer: yes",
