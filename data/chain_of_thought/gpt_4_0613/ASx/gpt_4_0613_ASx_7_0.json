The second statement adds an additional condition - the plink light being out. However, this additional condition does not change the original relationship between the tizzer and the goom. The original statement did not specify any conditions under which the tizzer being on would not result in the goom being snurpled. Therefore, even with the additional condition of the plink light being out, as long as the tizzer is on, we can still infer that the goom is snurpled. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
