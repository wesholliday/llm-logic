The additional condition in the second statement, that the snarp is flooping, is not relevant to whether the fribble is flugged or not, according to the original statement. The fribble being flugged is only dependent on it being in the snarp, not on the state of the snarp. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
