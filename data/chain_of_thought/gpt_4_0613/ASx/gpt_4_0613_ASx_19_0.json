This means that the condition for the snarf to be glonked is that the krimp is in the zool. The additional condition in the second statement, that the zool is zapped, does not change the outcome of the snarf being glonked as long as the krimp is in the zool. The original condition is still met in the second statement, so we can infer that the snarf will still be glonked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
