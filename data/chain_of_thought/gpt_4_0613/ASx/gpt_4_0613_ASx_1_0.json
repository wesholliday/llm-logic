Adding another condition (sproinged) to the if-clause doesn't change the fact that being blimmed leads to flooping. The snark flooping is not dependent on it sproinging, according to the information given. Therefore, if the snark was both blimmed and sproinged, it would still floop, because it was blimmed. \n\nAnswer: yes",
