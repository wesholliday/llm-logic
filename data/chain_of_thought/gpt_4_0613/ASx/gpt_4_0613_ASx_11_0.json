The new statement adds an additional condition - the quib being squinked. However, the original statement does not depend on the state of the quib at all. Therefore, even if the quib is squinked, as long as the zibble is zapped, the glorp will still zoon. The additional condition does not change the outcome.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
