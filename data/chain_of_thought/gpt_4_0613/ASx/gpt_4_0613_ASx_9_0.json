This means that blorping the ploofle is a sufficient condition for the fliggle to get a nurple. However, the statement does not provide any information about what happens when the ploofle is both blorped and zooned. It's possible that zooning the ploofle could prevent the fliggle from getting a nurple, even if the ploofle is also blorped. Without more information, we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
