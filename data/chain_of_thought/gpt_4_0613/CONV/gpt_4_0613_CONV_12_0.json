However, it does not necessarily mean that Lucy going to the zoo is a sufficient condition for Joe going to the park. In other words, Lucy could have gone to the zoo for other reasons, not necessarily because Joe went to the park. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park' from the given statement. \n\nAnswer: No",
