However, this does not necessarily mean that the presence of the unicorn implies the presence of the griffin. The unicorn could be in the forest without the griffin being there. The statement does not provide information about what happens when the unicorn is in the forest, only when the griffin is. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest.\n\nAnswer: No",
