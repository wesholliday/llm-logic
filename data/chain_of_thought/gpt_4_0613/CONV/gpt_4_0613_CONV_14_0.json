This is a conditional statement where the presence of the bear in the case is a sufficient condition for the wolf to be in the den. However, this does not necessarily mean that the presence of the wolf in the den is a sufficient condition for the bear to be in the case. The wolf could be in the den for other reasons not related to the bear being in the case. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case' from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: No",
