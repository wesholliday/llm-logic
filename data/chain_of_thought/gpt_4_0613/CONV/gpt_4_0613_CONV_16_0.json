However, this does not necessarily mean that every time the pants were denim, the shirt was cotton. The pants could be denim with a shirt made of a different material. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
