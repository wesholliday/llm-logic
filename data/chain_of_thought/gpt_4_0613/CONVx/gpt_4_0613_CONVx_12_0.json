However, it does not necessarily mean that the smip lupp the zoint is a sufficient condition for the smip was shripped. In other words, the smip could have lupped the zoint for other reasons, not just because it was shripped. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was shripped' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
