However, it does not tell us anything about what happens when the shank is nugged. It could be that every time the shank is nugged, it is also plooked, or it could be that sometimes the shank is nugged without being plooked. Without additional information, we cannot infer 'If the shank was nugged, then the shank was plooked' from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: no",
