However, it does not tell us that the only way for a dreb to be spened is by being vroombed. It is possible that there are other ways for a dreb to be spened that do not involve being vroombed. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was vroombed' from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: No",
