However, this does not necessarily mean that every time the sprocket was daggled, it was also cranked. It's possible that there are other ways to daggle the sprocket that don't involve cranking it. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was cranked' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
