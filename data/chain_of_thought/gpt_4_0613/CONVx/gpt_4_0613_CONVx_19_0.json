It states that if a certain condition (the smonk being vreebled) is met, then a certain outcome (the smonk plagging) will occur. However, this does not necessarily mean that the outcome can only occur if the condition is met. In other words, it's possible for the smonk to plag without it having been vreebled. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was vreebled' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
