The logical condition is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' and the fact is 'The banana was yellow'. However, the fact that the banana was yellow does not necessarily mean that the apple was red. This is because the logical condition only states what happens if the apple is red, not that the apple must be red if the banana is yellow. This is a common logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. Therefore, it does not necessarily follow that 'The apple was red' is true just because 'The banana was yellow' is true.\n\nAnswer: No",
