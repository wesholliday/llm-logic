It means that if the first part (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true. However, it does not mean that if the second part is true, then the first part must also be true. In other words, Sue being at the wedding does not necessarily mean that Mary was at the wedding. The statement 'Sue was at the wedding' being true does not provide enough information to determine whether 'Mary was at the wedding' is true or not. \n\nAnswer: No",
