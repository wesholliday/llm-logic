The first statement can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is 'the book was written by James' and Q is 'the book is a mystery novel'. The second statement tells us that Q is true. However, knowing that Q is true does not necessarily mean that P is true. This is a common logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. Just because the book is a mystery novel, it doesn't mean it was written by James, as there could be other authors who write mystery novels. Therefore, it does not follow that 'The book was written by James' is true just because 'The book is a mystery novel' is true.\n\nAnswer: No",
