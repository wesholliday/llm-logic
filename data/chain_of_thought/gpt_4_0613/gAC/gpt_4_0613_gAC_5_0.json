The first statement is a conditional statement, where Amy playing tennis is dependent on Jeff playing basketball. However, the second statement 'Amy played tennis' is independent and does not provide any information about whether Jeff played basketball or not. The fact that Amy played tennis does not necessarily mean that Jeff played basketball, because there could be other reasons why Amy played tennis. Therefore, it does not logically follow that 'Jeff played basketball' is true just because 'Amy played tennis' is true. \n\nAnswer: No",
