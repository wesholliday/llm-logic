In this type of statement, if the first part (the antecedent) is true, then the second part (the consequent) must also be true. However, the truth of the consequent (Lucy went to the zoo) does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (Joe went to the park) is true. This is a common logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. Therefore, even though 'Lucy went to the zoo' is true, we cannot definitively say that 'Joe went to the park' is true based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
