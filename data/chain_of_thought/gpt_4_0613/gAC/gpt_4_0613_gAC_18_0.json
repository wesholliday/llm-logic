            "content": "The given statements are examples of a logical form called a conditional, which is an \"if-then\" statement. The first part of the statement (following \"if\") is called the antecedent and the second part (following \"then\") is called the consequent. In this case, 'the doll was plastic' is the antecedent and 'the truck was metal' is the consequent.\n\nThe statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' being true means that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true. However, it does not mean that if the consequent is true, then the antecedent must also be true. This is a common logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent.\n\nSo, even though 'The truck was metal' is true, we cannot definitively say that 'The doll was plastic' is true based on the given information. The doll could have been plastic, but it could also have been made of some other material. The truth of the consequent does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent.\n\nAnswer: No",
