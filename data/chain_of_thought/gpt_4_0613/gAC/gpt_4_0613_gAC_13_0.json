The first statement is a conditional statement, where the car being red is a sufficient condition for the truck being blue. However, it does not mean that the truck being blue is a sufficient condition for the car being red. The truck could be blue for other reasons not related to the car's color. Therefore, even though the second statement 'The truck was blue' is true, it does not necessarily mean that 'The car was red' is true. \n\nAnswer: No",
