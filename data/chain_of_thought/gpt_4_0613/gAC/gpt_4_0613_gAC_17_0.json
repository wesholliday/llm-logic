However, it does not mean that whenever Kate eats salad, Ben must have eaten pasta. Kate could have eaten salad under different circumstances, not necessarily when Ben ate pasta. Therefore, even though 'Kate ate salad' is true, we cannot definitively conclude that 'Ben ate pasta' is true. \n\nAnswer: no",
