The first statement, 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake', is a conditional statement. In this statement, the vampire being awake is the condition for the mummy being awake. However, this does not mean that the mummy being awake is a condition for the vampire being awake. The second statement, 'The mummy was awake', does not provide any information about whether the vampire was awake or not. Therefore, from these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The vampire was awake' is true.\n\nAnswer: No",
