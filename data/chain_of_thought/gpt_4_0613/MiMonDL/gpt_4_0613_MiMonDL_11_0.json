When we say 'The weather might be sunny or rainy', we are simply expanding the range of possibilities to include not just sunny weather, but also rainy weather. Since the original statement did not exclude the possibility of rain, we can infer 'The weather might be sunny or rainy' from 'The weather might be sunny'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
