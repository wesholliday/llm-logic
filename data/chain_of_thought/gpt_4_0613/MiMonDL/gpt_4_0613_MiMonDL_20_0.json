However, it does not explicitly state the outcome if the team does not win. In the context of a game, if a team does not win, it typically means they lose (or in some cases, the game could end in a draw). Therefore, the statement 'The team might win the game or lose' is a more comprehensive version of the original statement, including both possible outcomes.\n\nAnswer: yes",
