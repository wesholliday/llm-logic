However, it does not explicitly state anything about the possibility of failure. That being said, the nature of 'might' implies uncertainty, and where there is uncertainty, there is typically a chance of both success and failure. Therefore, it can be inferred that if a project might be successful, it also might fail.\n\nAnswer: yes",
