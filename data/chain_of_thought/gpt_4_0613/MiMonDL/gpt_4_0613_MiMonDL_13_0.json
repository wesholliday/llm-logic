The statement 'The meeting might be cancelled or rescheduled' also implies a possibility of the meeting not taking place as originally planned, but adds an additional possibility of the meeting being rescheduled. The first statement is included in the second, because if the meeting might be cancelled, then it is also true that the meeting might be cancelled or rescheduled. Therefore, we can infer 'The meeting might be cancelled or rescheduled' from 'The meeting might be cancelled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
