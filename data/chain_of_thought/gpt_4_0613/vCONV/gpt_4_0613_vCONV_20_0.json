However, the truth of a statement and its converse are not necessarily linked. Just because 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' is true, it does not automatically mean that 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red' is also true. The banana could be yellow for a variety of reasons that have nothing to do with the color of the apple. Therefore, this form of argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
