However, the truth of a statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse. \n\nIn this case, the premise is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'. This means that Mary's presence at the wedding guarantees Sue's presence. However, the converse, 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding', is not necessarily true based on the given premise. Sue could have attended the wedding without Mary being there. \n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
