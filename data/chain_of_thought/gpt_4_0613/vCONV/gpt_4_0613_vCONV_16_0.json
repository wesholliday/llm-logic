However, the truth of a statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse. \n\nIn this case, the premise is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'. This means that every time the shirt was cotton, the pants were definitely denim. However, it does not necessarily mean that every time the pants were denim, the shirt was cotton. There could be other types of shirts that could be worn with denim pants. \n\nTherefore, the argument 'If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton' is not necessarily true based on the given premise. \n\nAnswer: No",
