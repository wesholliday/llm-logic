However, the truth of a statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse. \n\nIn this case, the premise is 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel'. This means that all books written by James are mystery novels. The converse is 'If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James'. This would mean that all mystery novels are written by James, which is not necessarily true. \n\nJust because all books written by James are mystery novels, it doesn't mean that all mystery novels are written by James. There could be many other authors who write mystery novels. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
