However, the truth of a statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse. \n\nIn this case, the premise is 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry'. This means that every time the cake is chocolate, the muffins are blueberry. However, it does not necessarily mean that every time the muffins are blueberry, the cake is chocolate. There could be other types of cake that also result in blueberry muffins. \n\nTherefore, the argument 'If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate' is not necessarily valid based on the given premise. \n\nAnswer: No",
