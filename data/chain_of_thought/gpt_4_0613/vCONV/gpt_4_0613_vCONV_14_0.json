However, the truth of a statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse. \n\nIn this case, the premise is 'If the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den'. The converse of this statement is 'If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case'. The truth of the original statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse. \n\nFor example, it could be the case that the wolf is in the den for reasons unrelated to the bear being in the case. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
