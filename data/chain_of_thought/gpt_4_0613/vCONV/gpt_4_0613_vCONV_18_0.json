However, the truth of a statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse. \n\nIn this case, the premise is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'. This means that every time the doll is plastic, the truck is metal. However, it does not necessarily mean that every time the truck is metal, the doll is plastic. There could be other instances where the truck is metal but the doll is not plastic. \n\nTherefore, the argument 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic' is not logically valid based solely on the given premise. \n\nAnswer: No",
