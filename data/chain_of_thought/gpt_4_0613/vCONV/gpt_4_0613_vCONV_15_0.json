In logic, the converse of a conditional statement is formed by interchanging the hypothesis (the 'if' clause) and the conclusion (the 'then' clause). However, the truth of a statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse. \n\nIn this case, the premise is 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train'. This means that Sam taking a plane is a sufficient condition for Erin taking a train. However, it does not necessarily mean that Erin taking a train is a sufficient condition for Sam taking a plane. There could be other reasons why Erin took a train. Therefore, the conclusion 'If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane' is not necessarily true based on the given premise.\n\nAnswer: No",
