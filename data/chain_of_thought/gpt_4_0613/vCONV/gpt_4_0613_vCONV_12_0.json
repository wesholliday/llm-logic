In logic, the converse of a conditional statement is formed by interchanging the hypothesis and the conclusion. However, the truth of a statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse. \n\nIn this case, the premise is 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'. This means that Joe going to the park is a sufficient condition for Lucy going to the zoo. However, it does not necessarily mean that Lucy going to the zoo is a sufficient condition for Joe going to the park. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo that have nothing to do with Joe going to the park. Therefore, the argument 'If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park' is not necessarily valid based on the given premise.\n\nAnswer: No",
