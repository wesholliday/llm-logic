Just because 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' is true, it does not necessarily mean that 'If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race' is also true. For example, it could be the case that Chris finished the race, but Alex did not. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
