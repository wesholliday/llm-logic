However, the truth of a statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse. \n\nIn this case, the premise is 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside'. This means that whenever the dog is inside, the cat is outside. However, it does not necessarily mean that whenever the cat is outside, the dog is inside. The dog could be either inside or outside when the cat is outside. Therefore, the conclusion 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside' is not necessarily true based on the given premise.\n\nAnswer: No",
