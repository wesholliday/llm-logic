            "content": "The form of argument in question is known as the converse. In logic, the converse of a conditional statement is formed by interchanging the hypothesis and the conclusion. However, the truth of a statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse. \n\nIn this case, the premise is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'. This means that Tom watching football is a sufficient condition for Jen watching basketball. However, it does not necessarily mean that Jen watching basketball is a sufficient condition for Tom watching football. \n\nFor example, it could be the case that Jen watches basketball regardless of whether Tom watches football or not. In this case, the premise would be true (since every time Tom watches football, Jen does indeed watch basketball), but the conclusion would be false (since Jen could watch basketball even when Tom does not watch football). \n\nTherefore, the form of argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
