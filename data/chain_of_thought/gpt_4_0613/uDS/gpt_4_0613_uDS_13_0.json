If the toy is not on the shelf, as stated in the second sentence, then by process of elimination, the toy must be in the toy box. This is because the toy has to be in one of the two places mentioned, and it can't be on the shelf. Therefore, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
