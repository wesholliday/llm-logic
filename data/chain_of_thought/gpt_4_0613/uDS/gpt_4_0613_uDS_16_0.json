In this case, the conditions are \"the pen is in my bag\" or \"the pen is on my desk\". We are also given that the pen is not on the desk. Since one of the conditions must be true, and we know that the pen is not on the desk, the only remaining option is that the pen is in the bag. Therefore, we can infer that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
