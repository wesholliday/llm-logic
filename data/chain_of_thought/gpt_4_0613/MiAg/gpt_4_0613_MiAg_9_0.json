However, it does not necessarily imply that these two events will occur simultaneously. The package could be delivered today but not be damaged, or it could be damaged but not delivered today. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer from the original statement that \"The package might be delivered damaged today\".\n\nAnswer: No",
