            "content": "Explanation: The original statement gives two separate possibilities: the computer might be on, and the computer might be running a virus scan. These are not necessarily happening at the same time. The proposed inference, however, suggests that the computer might be on and running a virus scan at the same time. While it's possible that both could be true, the original statement does not guarantee this. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer the proposed statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: no",
