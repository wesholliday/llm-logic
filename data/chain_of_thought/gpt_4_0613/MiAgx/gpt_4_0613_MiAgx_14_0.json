The proposed inference is essentially the same statement, just with a slightly different phrasing. The meaning of the two sentences is the same: both suggest the possibility that the blurble is blurble for a flump and the wumble is snizzle. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
