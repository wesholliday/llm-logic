            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence and the inferred sentence are essentially saying the same thing, but in a different order and with slightly different wording. The original sentence states that \"The quibble might be crunk wobble gribble and the zump might quork a flump\". The inferred sentence is \"It might be that the quibble is crunk wobble gribble and the zump quorks a flump\". Both sentences are suggesting the possibility of the quibble being crunk wobble gribble and the zump quorking a flump. The only difference is the order of the words and the use of \"might\" in the original sentence versus \"might be that\" in the inferred sentence. However, these changes do not alter the overall meaning of the sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
