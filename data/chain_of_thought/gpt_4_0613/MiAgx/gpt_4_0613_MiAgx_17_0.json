            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence and the proposed inference are essentially saying the same thing, just in a slightly different order and with a slightly different phrasing. The original sentence states that \"the frazzle might be flimble and the quazzle might be flonk by grazzle\". The proposed inference is \"It might be that the frazzle is flimble and the quazzle is flonk by grazzle\". Both sentences are expressing the possibility of the frazzle being flimble and the quazzle being flonk by grazzle. Therefore, we can infer the proposed sentence from the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
