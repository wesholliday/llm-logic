This means there is a possibility that the snorkel is plonk and the snork is wibble. The second statement is asking if it might be that the snorkel is plonk and the snork is wibble. This is essentially asking the same thing as the original statement, just phrased differently. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
