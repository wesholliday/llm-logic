The proposed inference is essentially a rephrasing of the original sentence, maintaining the same relationships between the nonsensical words. The only difference is the addition of \"It might be that\" at the beginning of the sentence, which doesn't change the meaning of the sentence, but rather emphasizes the possibility of the statement. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
