            "content": "Explanation: The sentence 'The wobble might be flonk zizz and the flimble might flibbit at zazzle snorkel' suggests two possibilities: that the wobble could be flonk zizz, and that the flimble could flibbit at zazzle snorkel. The proposed inference, 'It might be that the wobble is flonk zizz and the flimble flibbits at zazzle snorkel', is essentially restating these two possibilities in a slightly different way. The meaning of the two sentences is the same, even though the wording is slightly different.\n\nAnswer: yes",
