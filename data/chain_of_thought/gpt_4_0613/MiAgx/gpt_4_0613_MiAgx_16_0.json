            "content": "Explanation: The sentence 'The snorkel might be grooble frazzle and the quibble might blimple gronk blimple' suggests two possibilities: that the snorkel could be grooble frazzle, and that the quibble could blimple gronk blimple. The proposed inference 'It might be that the snorkel is grooble frazzle and the quibble blimples gronk blimple' is essentially restating these two possibilities in a slightly different way. The meaning of the two sentences is the same, even though the wording is slightly different.\n\nAnswer: yes",
