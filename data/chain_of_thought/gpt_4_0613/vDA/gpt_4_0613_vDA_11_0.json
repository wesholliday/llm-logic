            "content": "The form of argument in question is a form of logical reasoning known as Modus Tollens. However, the argument as presented is not a correct application of Modus Tollens. \n\nModus Tollens works as follows: If P implies Q, and not-Q is true, then not-P must also be true. In this case, P is 'the cake was chocolate' and Q is 'the muffins were blueberry'. \n\nThe argument given is 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' (P implies Q), and 'The cake was not chocolate' (not-P). The conclusion drawn is 'The muffins were not blueberry' (not-Q). \n\nHowever, the fact that the cake was not chocolate (not-P) does not necessarily mean that the muffins were not blueberry (not-Q). The original statement only asserts that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. It does not make any assertion about what happens when the cake is not chocolate. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. \n\nSo, the form of argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
