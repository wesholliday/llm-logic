The first premise establishes a condition where if Alex finishes the race, then Chris finishes the race. However, the second premise only tells us that Alex did not finish the race. This does not provide any information about whether Chris finished the race or not. Chris could have finished the race even if Alex did not. Therefore, the conclusion that Chris did not finish the race does not logically follow from the premises. \n\nAnswer: No",
