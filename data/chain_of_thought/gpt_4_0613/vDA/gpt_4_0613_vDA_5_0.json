This is a logical fallacy because it incorrectly assumes that if the first part (antecedent) of a conditional statement is false, then the second part (consequent) must also be false. However, this is not necessarily true. In this case, just because Jeff did not play basketball (the antecedent is false), it does not necessarily mean that Amy did not play tennis (the consequent is false). Amy could have played tennis for other reasons unrelated to whether Jeff played basketball or not. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
