            "content": "The form of argument presented here is known as denying the antecedent, which is a logical fallacy. The first premise establishes a condition: if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. However, the second premise denies this condition: the book was not written by James. The conclusion drawn from these premises is that the book is not a mystery novel. This conclusion is not logically valid because the first premise does not state that only James writes mystery novels. It is possible that the book could be a mystery novel even if it was not written by James. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
