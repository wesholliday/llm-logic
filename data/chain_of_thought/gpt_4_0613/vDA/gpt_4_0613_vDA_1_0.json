The antecedent in the first premise is \"Mary was at the wedding\", and the second premise denies this antecedent. However, this does not necessarily mean that the consequent, \"Sue was at the wedding\", is also false. The first premise only states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also there. It does not state what happens if Mary was not at the wedding. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that Sue was not at the wedding based on the given premises. \n\nAnswer: No",
