However, the argument as presented does not correctly follow the structure of Modus Tollens. \n\nModus Tollens is a valid form of argument that follows this structure: If P then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P. \n\nIn the given argument, the structure is: If P then Q. Not P. Therefore, not Q. This is not a valid form of argument because the first premise does not guarantee that P is the only condition for Q. In other words, just because the vampire (P) was not awake, it does not necessarily mean that the mummy (Q) was not awake. The mummy could have been awake for other reasons not mentioned in the premises. \n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
