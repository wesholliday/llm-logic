The second premise denies this antecedent. However, this does not logically imply that Erin did not take a train. The first premise only states what happens if Sam took a plane, not what happens if he didn't. Therefore, the conclusion \"Erin did not take a train\" does not logically follow from the premises. \n\nAnswer: No",
