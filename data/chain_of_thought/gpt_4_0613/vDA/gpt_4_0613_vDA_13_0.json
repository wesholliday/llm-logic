            "content": "The form of argument in question is a form of deductive reasoning known as Modus Tollens. However, it is not correctly applied in this case. \n\nModus Tollens works as follows: If P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must also be false. In this case, P is 'the car was red' and Q is 'the truck was blue'. \n\nThe argument given is 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' (P implies Q), and 'The car was not red' (not P). The conclusion drawn is 'The truck was not blue' (not Q). \n\nThis is not a valid application of Modus Tollens, because the second premise negates P (the car was not red), not Q (the truck was blue). Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the truck was not blue (not Q) based on the given premises. \n\nIn other words, just because the car was not red, it does not necessarily mean that the truck was not blue. The truck could be blue for other reasons not related to the color of the car. \n\nSo, the form of argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
