            "content": "The form of argument in question is known as denying the antecedent. This is a logical fallacy where if the first condition doesn't happen, then the second condition must not happen either. However, this is not necessarily true. Just because Lisa didn't buy the red shirt doesn't mean that Mark didn't buy the blue shirt. Mark could have bought the blue shirt regardless of whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not. The argument doesn't provide any information about what happens if Lisa doesn't buy the red shirt. Therefore, the conclusion 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt' doesn't logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
