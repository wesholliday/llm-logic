However, the argument as presented does not correctly follow the structure of Modus Tollens. \n\nModus Tollens is a valid form of argument that follows this structure: If P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P. \n\nIn the given argument, the structure is: If P, then Q. Not P. Therefore, not Q. \n\nThis is not a valid form of argument because the second premise (Not P) does not necessarily imply the conclusion (Not Q). Just because Sue did not choose pizza (Not P) does not necessarily mean that Bob did not choose pasta (Not Q). Bob could have chosen pasta for reasons unrelated to Sue's choice. \n\nTherefore, the argument as presented is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
