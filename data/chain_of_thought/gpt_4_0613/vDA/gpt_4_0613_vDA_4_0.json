In this case, the first premise is 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter'. The second premise is 'The alien did not visit Mars'. However, the conclusion 'The robot did not visit Jupiter' does not logically follow from these premises. Just because the alien did not visit Mars, it does not necessarily mean that the robot did not visit Jupiter. The robot could have visited Jupiter for a different reason. Therefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.",
