            "content": "The form of argument in question is a form of logical reasoning known as a conditional statement or implication, which is often expressed in the form \"If P, then Q\". In this case, P is 'The apple was red' and Q is 'The banana was yellow'. \n\nThe second premise states that 'The apple was not red', which is the negation of P. However, in logic, if the first part (P) of a conditional statement is false, it doesn't necessarily mean that the second part (Q) is also false. This is known as denying the antecedent, which is a logical fallacy. \n\nIn other words, just because the apple was not red, it doesn't necessarily mean that the banana was not yellow. The banana could be yellow or not yellow regardless of the color of the apple. Therefore, the conclusion 'The banana was not yellow' does not logically follow from the premises given.\n\nAnswer: No",
