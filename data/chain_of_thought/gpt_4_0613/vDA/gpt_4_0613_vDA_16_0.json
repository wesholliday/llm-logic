            "content": "The form of argument in question is known as Modus Tollens in formal logic. However, the argument as presented does not correctly follow the structure of Modus Tollens. \n\nModus Tollens is a valid form of argument that follows this structure: If P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P. \n\nIn the given argument, the structure is: If P, then Q. Not P. Therefore, not Q. This is not a valid form of argument because the second premise negates the antecedent (P) rather than the consequent (Q). \n\nIn other words, just because the shirt was not cotton (not P), we cannot logically conclude that the pants were not denim (not Q). The first premise only tells us what happens if the shirt was cotton (P), not what happens if it wasn't. \n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
