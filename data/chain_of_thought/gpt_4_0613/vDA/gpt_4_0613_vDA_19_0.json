            "content": "The form of argument presented here is known as Modus Tollens in formal logic. However, the argument is not correctly applied in this case. Modus Tollens states that if the first premise is true (If P, then Q) and the second premise is the negation of Q (Not Q), then the conclusion is the negation of P (Not P). In this case, the second premise is the negation of P (Tom did not watch football), not Q. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that Jen did not watch basketball (Not Q) based on the given premises. The argument would be valid if the second premise was 'Jen did not watch basketball', leading to the conclusion 'Tom did not watch football'. But as it stands, the argument is not logically valid.",
