The first premise is 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside'. The second premise is 'The dog was not inside'. \n\nThe conclusion 'The cat was not outside' does not logically follow from these premises. The premises only tell us what happens if the dog is inside (the cat is outside). But they do not tell us what happens if the dog is not inside. The cat could still be outside even if the dog is not inside. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises. \n\nSo, the form of argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
