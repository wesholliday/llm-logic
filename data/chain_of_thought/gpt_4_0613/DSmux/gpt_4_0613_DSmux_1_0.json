These are the only two options given, and the statement implies that one of them must be true. The second statement tells us that it is not the case that the flugel must be zargled. This eliminates one of the two possibilities presented in the first statement. Since one of the two must be true, and it's not the case that the flugel must be zargled, the only remaining possibility is that the flugel is blimmed. \n\nAnswer: yes",
