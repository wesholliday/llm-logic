These are the only two options given, so if one is false, the other must be true. The second statement tells us that it's not the case that the wug must be garpled. This means that the second option from the first statement is false. Since these were the only two options and the second one is false, the first one must be true. Therefore, we can infer that the wug is sproinged. \n\nAnswer: yes",
