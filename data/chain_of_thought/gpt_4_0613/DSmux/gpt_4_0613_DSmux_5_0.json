These are the only two options given, and the statement implies that at least one of them must be true. \n\nThe second statement tells us that it's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled. This eliminates one of the possibilities presented in the first statement.\n\nSince the first statement told us that one of the two options must be true, and the second statement eliminated one of those options, we are left with only one possibility: the zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
