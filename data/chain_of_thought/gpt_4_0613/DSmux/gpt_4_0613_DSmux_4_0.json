These are the only two options given, and the statement implies that one of them must be true. The second statement tells us that it's not the case that the fribble must be crinked. This eliminates one of the possibilities presented in the first statement. Since the first statement told us that one of these two possibilities must be true, and the second statement eliminated one of them, we are left with only one possibility: the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
