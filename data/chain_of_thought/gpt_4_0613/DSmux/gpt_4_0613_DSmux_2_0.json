The second statement negates one of these possibilities, stating that it's not the case that the wug must be bimmed. If we accept these two statements as true, then the only remaining possibility for the wug, according to the information given, is that it is flooped. Therefore, we can infer from these statements that the wug is flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
