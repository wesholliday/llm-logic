The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities, stating that it is not the case that the grommet must be plopped. With this option removed, the only remaining possibility for the grommet, according to the initial statement, is that it is sploffed. Therefore, we can infer from these two statements that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
