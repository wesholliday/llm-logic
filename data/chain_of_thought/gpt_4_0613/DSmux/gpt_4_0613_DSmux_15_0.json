The second statement negates one of these possibilities, stating that it's not the case that the dreb must be spened. If we accept these two statements as true, then the only remaining possibility for the dreb, according to the information given, is that it is vroombed. Therefore, we can infer from these two statements that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
