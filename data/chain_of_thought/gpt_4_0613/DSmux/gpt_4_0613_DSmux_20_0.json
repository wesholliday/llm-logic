These are the only two options given, and at least one of them must be true. The second statement tells us that it's not the case that the fleeg must be surned. This eliminates one of the possibilities from the first statement. Since at least one of the options from the first statement must be true, and we know that it's not the case that the fleeg must be surned, the only remaining option is that the fleeg is bluttered. Therefore, we can infer that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
