This means that if one of these conditions is not met, the other must be true. The second statement tells us that it's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled. Therefore, given that one of the two conditions from the first statement must be true, and it's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
