These are the only two options given, and they are presented as mutually exclusive, meaning that if one is true, the other must be false. \n\nThe second statement tells us that it is not the case that the clug must be snugged. This means that the second option presented in the first statement is false. \n\nGiven that these were the only two options, and the second has been ruled out, we can infer that the first must be true. \n\nTherefore, the clug is fleeked. \n\nAnswer: yes",
