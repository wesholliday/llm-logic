This is an example of a disjunction in logic, where at least one of the propositions must be true. \n\nThe second statement tells us that it is not the case that the smonk must be plagged. This negates one of the possibilities presented in the first statement.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can infer that the only remaining possibility for the smonk is that it is vreebled. \n\nAnswer: yes",
