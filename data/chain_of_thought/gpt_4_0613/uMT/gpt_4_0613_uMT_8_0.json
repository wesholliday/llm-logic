In logic, if we have a conditional statement of the form \"If P then Q\", and we know that Q is false, we can infer that P is also false. This is known as modus tollens. In this case, P is \"the vampire was awake\" and Q is \"the mummy was awake\". We know that the mummy was not awake, so we can infer that the vampire was not awake. \n\nAnswer: yes",
