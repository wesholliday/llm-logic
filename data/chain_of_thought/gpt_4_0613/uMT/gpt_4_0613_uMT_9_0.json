The second statement tells us that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. If we assume that the first statement is true, then the only way for Mark not to have bought the blue shirt is if Lisa did not buy the red shirt. If Lisa had bought the red shirt, according to the first statement, Mark would have bought the blue shirt, which contradicts the second statement. Therefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
