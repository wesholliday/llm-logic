The second statement tells us that the banana is not yellow. According to the rules of logic, if the result of a condition is false, then the condition itself must also be false. In other words, if the banana is not yellow, then the apple cannot be red. Therefore, we can infer that the apple was not red. \n\nAnswer: yes",
