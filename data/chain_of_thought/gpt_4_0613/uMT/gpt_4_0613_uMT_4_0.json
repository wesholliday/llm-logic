            "content": "The statement \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" is a conditional statement. In logic, if we have a conditional statement of the form \"If P then Q\", and we know that Q is false, then we can infer that P is also false. This is known as the principle of contraposition. In this case, P is \"the alien visited Mars\" and Q is \"the robot visited Jupiter\". We know that Q is false because it is given that \"the robot did not visit Jupiter\". Therefore, we can infer that P is also false, i.e., the alien did not visit Mars. \n\nAnswer: yes",
