This is a conditional statement, where the condition is \"the book was written by James\" and the result is \"the book is a mystery novel\". \n\n2. The book is not a mystery novel. This is a simple statement that contradicts the result of the conditional statement.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, if the result of a conditional statement is false, then the condition must also be false. This is known as the contrapositive. In this case, if the book is not a mystery novel (the result is false), then the book was not written by James (the condition is false). \n\nTherefore, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
