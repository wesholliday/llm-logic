The statement also tells us that Q is false, meaning \"the cat was not outside\". According to the rules of logic, if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must also be false. Therefore, if the dog being inside implies that the cat is outside, and the cat is not outside, then the dog cannot be inside. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
