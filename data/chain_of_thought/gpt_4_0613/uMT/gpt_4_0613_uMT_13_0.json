The second statement \"The truck was not blue\" is the negation of the consequent of the first statement. According to the rules of logic, specifically the rule of contraposition, if the consequent is false (the truck was not blue), then the antecedent (the car was red) must also be false. Therefore, we can infer that the car was not red. \n\nAnswer: yes",
