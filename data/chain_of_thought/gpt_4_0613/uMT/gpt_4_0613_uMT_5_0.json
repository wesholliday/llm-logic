However, we know that Amy did not play tennis. If Amy's tennis playing is a guaranteed result of Jeff's basketball playing, and Amy did not play tennis, then it must be the case that Jeff did not play basketball. If he had, Amy would have played tennis, which contradicts the information given. Therefore, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
