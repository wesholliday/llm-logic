It tells us what happens if Sue chooses pizza, but it doesn't tell us what happens if Sue doesn't choose pizza. \n\nThe second statement tells us that Bob did not choose pasta. If we combine these two statements, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza. This is because if Sue had chosen pizza, then according to the first statement, Bob would have chosen pasta. But we know from the second statement that Bob did not choose pasta. Therefore, Sue could not have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
