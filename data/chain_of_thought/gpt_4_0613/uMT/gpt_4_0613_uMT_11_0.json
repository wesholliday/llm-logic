            "content": "The statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is a conditional statement. In logic, if we have a conditional statement of the form \"If P then Q\", and we know that Q is false, then we can infer that P is also false. This is known as the principle of contraposition. In this case, P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry\". We know that Q is false because it is given that \"the muffins were not blueberry\". Therefore, we can infer that P is also false, i.e., the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
