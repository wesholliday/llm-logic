In this case, Joe going to the park is the condition that leads to Lucy going to the zoo. \n\nThe second statement tells us that Lucy did not go to the zoo. \n\nIf we know that the outcome (Lucy going to the zoo) did not happen, then the condition (Joe going to the park) could not have happened, because if it had, Lucy would have gone to the zoo. \n\nTherefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
