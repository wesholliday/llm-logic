            "content": "The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is a conditional statement. It means that whenever Tom watches football, Jen watches basketball. However, we know that Jen did not watch basketball. If she had, that would mean Tom watched football. But since she didn't, we can infer that Tom did not watch football. If he had, then Jen would have watched basketball, which contradicts the information given. Therefore, we can conclude that Tom did not watch football. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
