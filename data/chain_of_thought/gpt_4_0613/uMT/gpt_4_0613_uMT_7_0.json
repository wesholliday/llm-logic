In other words, if Alex finishes, Chris must also finish. However, we know that Chris did not finish the race. If Chris had finished the race, it could have been possible that Alex also finished the race. But since Chris did not finish, and we know that if Alex finishes then Chris must also finish, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race. This is because if Alex had finished, then Chris would have also finished, which contradicts the information we have. Therefore, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race. \n\nAnswer: yes",
