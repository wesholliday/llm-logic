The second statement \"the truck was not metal\" is the negation of the consequent of the first statement. According to the rules of logic, specifically the rule of contrapositive, if a conditional statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. The contrapositive of the first statement is \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\". Since the truck was not metal, we can infer that the doll was not plastic. \n\nAnswer: yes",
