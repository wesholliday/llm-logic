However, it does not imply that if Sue is not at the wedding, then Mary is not at the wedding. This is because the statement does not provide information about what happens when Sue is not at the wedding. Therefore, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding based on the information that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No",
