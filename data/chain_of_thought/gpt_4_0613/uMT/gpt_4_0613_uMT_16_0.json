            "content": "The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement. In logic, if we have a conditional statement of the form \"If P then Q\", and we know that Q is false, we can infer that P is also false. This is known as modus tollens. In this case, P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim\". We know that Q is false because it is given that \"the pants were not denim\". Therefore, we can infer that P is also false, i.e., the shirt was not cotton. \n\nAnswer: yes",
