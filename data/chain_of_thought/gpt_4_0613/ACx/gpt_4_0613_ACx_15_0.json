The second statement confirms that 'the dreb was spened'. \n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that 'the dreb was vroombed'. The first statement only tells us that if 'the dreb was vroombed' then it definitely was 'spened', but it doesn't tell us that 'vroombed' is the only condition that can lead to 'spened'. There could be other conditions that can also lead to 'spened'. \n\nSo, from the given statements, we cannot infer that 'The dreb was vroombed'. \n\nAnswer: No",
