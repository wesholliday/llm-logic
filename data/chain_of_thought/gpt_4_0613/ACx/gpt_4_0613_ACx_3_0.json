The first statement is a conditional statement, where the occurrence of the splat quanking is dependent on the splat being morphed. However, the second statement only tells us that the splat quanked. It does not tell us whether the splat was morphed or not. The splat could have quanked for a different reason other than being morphed. Therefore, we cannot infer that the splat was morphed just because the splat quanked. \n\nAnswer: No",
