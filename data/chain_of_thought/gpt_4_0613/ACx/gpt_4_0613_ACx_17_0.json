The first statement is a conditional statement, where 'the flob was skizzled' is the condition for 'the flob movated'. The second statement tells us that 'the flob movated' happened. However, this does not necessarily mean that 'the flob was skizzled' happened. There could be other conditions that could lead to 'the flob movated'. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'the flob was skizzled' from these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
