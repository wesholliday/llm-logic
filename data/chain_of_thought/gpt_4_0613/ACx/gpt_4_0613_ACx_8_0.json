The sprocket was daggled.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the sprocket was cranked) is true, then the second part (the sprocket was daggled) must also be true. However, this does not mean that if the second part is true, then the first part must also be true. \n\nThe second statement tells us that the sprocket was daggled. However, this does not necessarily mean that the sprocket was cranked. It could have been daggled by some other means. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from these two statements that the sprocket was cranked. \n\nAnswer: No",
