The first statement only tells us that if 'the flug was blummed' then it must have been 'zimmed', but it does not tell us that being 'zimmed' can only happen if the 'flug was blummed'. \n\nIn other words, there could be other conditions that could lead to the 'flug being zimmed'. So, we cannot infer that 'the flug was blummed' just from the fact that 'the flug was zimmed'. \n\nAnswer: No",
