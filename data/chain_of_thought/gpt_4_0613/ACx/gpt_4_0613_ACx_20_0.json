The first statement is a conditional statement, where 'the fleeg was bluttered' is the condition for 'it surned'. The second statement only tells us that 'the fleeg surned', but it does not tell us whether 'the fleeg was bluttered' or not. The surning of the fleeg could have been caused by something else. Therefore, from these two statements, we cannot infer that 'The fleeg was bluttered'.\n\nAnswer: no",
