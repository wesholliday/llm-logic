In other words, if Sue chooses pizza, we can be sure that Bob will choose pasta. \n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that if Bob does not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza. It is possible that Sue chose pizza, but Bob chose something other than pasta for some other reason. \n\nThe original statement does not provide information about what happens when Bob does not choose pasta. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza' from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: No",
