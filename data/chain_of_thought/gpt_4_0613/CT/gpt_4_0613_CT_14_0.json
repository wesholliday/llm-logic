            "content": "The original statement is 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den'. This is a conditional statement, where the presence of the bear in the cave implies the presence of the wolf in the den. \n\nThe question asks if we can infer 'If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave' from the original statement. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nThe contrapositive of a statement 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'. In this case, P is 'the bear was in the cave' and Q is 'the wolf was in the den'. So, the contrapositive of the original statement is 'If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave', which is exactly what the question is asking. \n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave' from the original statement 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
