            "content": "The original statement is 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad'. This is a conditional statement where Ben eating pasta is the condition for Kate eating salad. \n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the condition and the result and reversing their order. So, the contrapositive of the original statement would be 'If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta'. \n\nThe contrapositive always has the same truth value as the original statement. If the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer 'If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta' from 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
