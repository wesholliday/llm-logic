            "content": "The original statement is 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'. This is a conditional statement where the car being red is the condition for the truck being blue. \n\nThe inverse of this statement is 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red'. This is logically equivalent to the original statement. If the original statement is true, then the inverse is also true. \n\nIn the original statement, the car being red guarantees that the truck is blue. Therefore, if the truck is not blue, it must be that the car was not red, because if the car was red, the truck would have to be blue. \n\nSo, we can infer 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red' from 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
