            "content": "The original statement is 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside'. This is a conditional statement where the dog being inside is the condition for the cat being outside. \n\nThe inverse of this statement is 'If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside'. This is logically equivalent to the original statement because it is saying that if the condition for the cat being outside is not met (i.e., the cat is not outside), then the condition for the dog being inside is also not met (i.e., the dog is not inside). \n\nSo, if we know that the original statement is true, then we can infer that the inverse statement is also true. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
