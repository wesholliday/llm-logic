So, the contrapositive of the original statement would be: \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\" \n\nThe contrapositive always holds true if the original statement is true. Therefore, we can infer \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
