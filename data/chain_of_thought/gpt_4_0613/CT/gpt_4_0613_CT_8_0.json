This means that the vampire's being awake is a sufficient condition for the mummy's being awake. However, it does not necessarily mean that the mummy's being awake is a necessary condition for the vampire's being awake. In other words, the vampire could potentially be awake even if the mummy is not. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake' from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: No",
