This is a conditional statement where the doll being plastic is the condition for the truck being metal. \n\nThe inverse of this statement is 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic'. This is saying that if the condition for the truck being metal is not met, then the doll cannot be plastic. \n\nThis is a valid inference because it maintains the relationship established in the original statement. If the condition for the truck being metal (the doll being plastic) is not met, then the truck cannot be metal, and therefore the doll cannot be plastic. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
