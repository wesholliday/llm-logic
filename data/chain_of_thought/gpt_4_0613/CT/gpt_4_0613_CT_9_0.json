            "content": "The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\". This means that Lisa buying the red shirt is a sufficient condition for Mark buying the blue shirt. \n\nThe question asks us to infer the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and reversing their order. So, the contrapositive of the original statement would be: \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\". \n\nIn logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
