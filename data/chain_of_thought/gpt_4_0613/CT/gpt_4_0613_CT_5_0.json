            "content": "The original statement is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'. This is a conditional statement where Jeff playing basketball is the condition for Amy playing tennis. \n\nThe second statement 'If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball' is the contrapositive of the original statement. In a contrapositive, the condition and the result are both reversed and negated. \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement always holds the same truth value as the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. \n\nSo, based on the original statement, we can infer that 'If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball'. \n\nAnswer: yes",
