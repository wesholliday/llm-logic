            "content": "The original statement is 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'. This is a conditional statement where Joe going to the park is the condition for Lucy going to the zoo. If we reverse this, we get 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park'. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. So, we can infer 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park' from 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
