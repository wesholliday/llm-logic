However, this does not necessarily mean that all mystery novels are written by James. There could be other authors who write mystery novels as well. \n\nThe proposed inference is 'If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James'. This is suggesting that James only writes mystery novels, which is consistent with the original statement. If a book is not a mystery novel, it could not have been written by James, because according to the original statement, James only writes mystery novels. \n\nTherefore, the inference is valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
