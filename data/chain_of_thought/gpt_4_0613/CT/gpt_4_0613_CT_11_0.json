            "content": "The original statement is 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry'. This is a conditional statement where the cake being chocolate is the condition for the muffins being blueberry. \n\nThe question asks if we can infer 'If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate' from the original statement. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nThe contrapositive of a statement 'If P then Q' is 'If not Q then not P'. In this case, P is 'the cake was chocolate' and Q is 'the muffins were blueberry'. So, the contrapositive of the original statement is 'If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate', which is exactly what the question is asking. \n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate' from the original statement 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
