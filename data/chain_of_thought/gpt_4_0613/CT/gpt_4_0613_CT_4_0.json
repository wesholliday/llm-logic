            "content": "The original statement is 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter'. This is a conditional statement where the alien visiting Mars is the condition for the robot visiting Jupiter. \n\nThe question asks if we can infer 'If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars' from the original statement. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the condition and the result and reversing their order. \n\nIn logic, if a statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if the original statement 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter' is true, then its contrapositive 'If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars' is also true. \n\nAnswer: yes",
