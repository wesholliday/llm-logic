            "content": "The original statement is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'. This is a conditional statement where Tom watching football is the condition that leads to Jen watching basketball. \n\nThe question asks if we can infer 'If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football' from the original statement. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nThe contrapositive is formed by negating both the condition and the result of the original statement and reversing their order. So, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if it's true that 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball', it's also true that 'If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
