            "content": "The statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' implies that Sam taking a plane is a sufficient condition for Erin taking a train. If this condition is not met, i.e., if Erin did not take a train, then it implies that the sufficient condition (Sam taking a plane) did not occur. This is based on the principle of contrapositive in logic, where 'If P then Q' is logically equivalent to 'If not Q then not P'. Therefore, if Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
