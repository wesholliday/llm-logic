            "content": "The statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' implies that Chris's finishing the race is dependent on Alex's finishing the race. In other words, if Alex finishes, Chris also finishes. However, it does not provide information about what happens if Chris does not finish the race. \n\nHowever, in logic, this is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement of the form \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P\". In this case, P is 'Alex finished the race' and Q is 'Chris finished the race'. So the contrapositive is 'If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race'. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. If the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
