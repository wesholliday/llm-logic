            "content": "The statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' implies that Sue's presence at the wedding is dependent on Mary's presence. In other words, if Mary is there, Sue is definitely there. However, this does not necessarily mean that if Sue is not there, then Mary is not there. It's possible that Mary could be at the wedding even if Sue is not. The original statement does not provide information about what happens when Sue is not at the wedding. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
