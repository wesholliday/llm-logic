This means that the presence of the griffin guarantees the presence of the unicorn. However, it does not provide any information about what happens when the unicorn is not in the forest. The absence of the unicorn does not necessarily mean the absence of the griffin. The griffin could be in the forest or not, the statement doesn't specify. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
