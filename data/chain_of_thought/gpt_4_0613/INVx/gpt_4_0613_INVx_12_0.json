This means that the smip lupping the zoint is a consequence of the smip being shripped. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the smip was not shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint. There could be other conditions under which the smip lupped the zoint. The inference is a logical fallacy known as denying the antecedent, which is invalid in formal logic. \n\nAnswer: No",
