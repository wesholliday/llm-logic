This means that every time the flugel is blimmed, it is also zargled. However, this does not provide any information about what happens when the flugel is not blimmed. It's possible that the flugel could still be zargled even if it wasn't blimmed. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the flugel was not blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
