However, it does not tell us anything about what happens when a flug is not blummed. It is possible that a flug could be not blummed and still be zimmed, or not blummed and not zimmed. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the flug was not blummed, then the flug was not zimmed' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
