            "content": "The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\". This means that sploffing the grommet is a sufficient condition for the grommet to plop the frink. However, it does not necessarily mean that sploffing is the only way for the grommet to plop the frink. There could be other conditions or ways for the grommet to plop the frink. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the grommet was not sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink. The grommet could have plopped the frink under different conditions.\n\nAnswer: No",
