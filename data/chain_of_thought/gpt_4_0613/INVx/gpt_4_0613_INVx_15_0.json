            "content": "The statement 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened' is a conditional statement. It tells us that whenever a dreb is vroombed, it is also spened. However, it does not tell us anything about what happens when a dreb is not vroombed. It is possible that a dreb could not be vroombed and still be spened, or it could not be vroombed and not be spened. The original statement does not provide enough information to make an inference about what happens when a dreb is not vroombed. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
