This means that being sproinged is a sufficient condition for being garpled. However, it does not provide any information about what happens when the wug is not sproinged. It's possible that a wug could be not sproinged and still be garpled, or not sproinged and not garpled. The original statement does not provide enough information to make an inference about what happens when the wug is not sproinged. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
