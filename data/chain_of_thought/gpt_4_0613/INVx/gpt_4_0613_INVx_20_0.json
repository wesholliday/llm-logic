            "content": "The statement 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned' is a conditional statement. The inference 'If the fleeg was not bluttered, then it did not surn' is the inverse of the original statement. However, in logic, the inverse does not necessarily hold true just because the original statement is true. For example, if we say 'If it is raining, then the ground is wet', it does not necessarily mean 'If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet', because there could be other reasons for the ground to be wet (like a sprinkler). So, we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: No",
