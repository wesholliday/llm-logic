The inference 'If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink' is the inverse of the original statement. However, in logic, the inverse does not necessarily hold true if the original statement is true. Just because a sneg sprots the frink when it is crampled, it does not mean that a sneg cannot sprot the frink when it is not crampled. The original statement does not provide information about what happens when the sneg is not crampled.\n\nAnswer: No",
