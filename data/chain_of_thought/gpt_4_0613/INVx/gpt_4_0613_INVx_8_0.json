This means that cranking the sprocket is a sufficient condition for the sprocket to be daggled. However, it does not provide information about what happens when the sprocket is not cranked. It is possible that the sprocket could be daggled by other means or under other conditions. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled. \n\nAnswer: No",
