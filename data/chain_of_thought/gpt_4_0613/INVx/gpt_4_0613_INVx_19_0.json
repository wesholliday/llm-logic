However, it does not tell us anything about what happens when the smonk was not vreebled. It's possible that the smonk could still have plagged even if it was not vreebled. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged' from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: No",
