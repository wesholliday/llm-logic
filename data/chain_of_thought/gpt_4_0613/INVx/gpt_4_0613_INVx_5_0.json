This is a conditional statement, where being 'fraggled' is a sufficient condition for being 'smoogled'. However, it does not provide information about what happens when the zinger is not fraggled. It is possible that the zinger could be smoogled even if it is not fraggled. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
