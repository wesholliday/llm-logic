However, it does not provide information about what happens when Lisa does not buy the red shirt. It is possible that Mark could still buy the blue shirt even if Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt. \n\nAnswer: No",
