It does not provide any information about what happens when Sam does not take a plane. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train. Erin could still take a train even if Sam did not take a plane. The original statement does not provide any information about this scenario. \n\nAnswer: No",
