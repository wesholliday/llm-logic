It does not provide information about what happens when the condition (Joe going to the park) is not met. It is possible that Lucy could still go to the zoo even if Joe did not go to the park. The statement does not establish a direct cause-effect relationship between Joe's and Lucy's actions. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo. \n\nAnswer: no",
