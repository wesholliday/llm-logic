It tells us what happens if a certain condition (Jeff playing basketball) is met. However, it does not tell us what happens if that condition is not met. In other words, it does not tell us what happens if Jeff did not play basketball. Amy could still have played tennis even if Jeff did not play basketball. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis. \n\nAnswer: No",
