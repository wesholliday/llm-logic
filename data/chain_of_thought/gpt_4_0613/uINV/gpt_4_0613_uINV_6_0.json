Bob could still choose pasta even if Sue did not choose pizza. The statement only provides a certain outcome (Bob choosing pasta) if a certain condition is met (Sue choosing pizza). It does not provide a certain outcome if the condition is not met. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: No",
