However, it does not mean that being written by James is a necessary condition for the book to be a mystery novel. In other words, the book could still be a mystery novel even if it was not written by James. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel. \n\nAnswer: No",
