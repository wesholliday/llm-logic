However, it does not provide any information about what happens when the bear is not in the cave. The wolf could still be in the den, or it could not be. The statement does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion about the wolf's location when the bear is not in the cave. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den. \n\nAnswer: No",
