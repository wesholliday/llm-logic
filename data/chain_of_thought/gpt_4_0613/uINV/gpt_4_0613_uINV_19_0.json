It tells us what will happen (Jen will watch basketball) if a certain condition is met (Tom watches football). However, it does not tell us what will happen if the condition is not met. It's possible that Jen might watch basketball even if Tom does not watch football. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball. \n\nAnswer: No",
