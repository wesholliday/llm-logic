It does not provide information about what happens if the alien did not visit Mars. It only tells us that if the alien did visit Mars, then the robot definitely visited Jupiter. It does not tell us anything about what happens if the alien did not visit Mars. The robot could still have visited Jupiter even if the alien did not visit Mars. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter. \n\nAnswer: No",
