    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the flu, common cold, and strep throat are the most prevalent illnesses this season. Doctors expect the flu likely will infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind. These are the only major illnesses spreading, so if colds don\u2019t infect the most people, then if flu doesn\u2019t, strep will. Moreover, flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if flu doesn\u2019t infect the most, strep will?",

            "content": "The question is asking if it's likely that, if the flu doesn't infect the most people, strep will. The information given states that the flu is expected to infect the most people, followed by the common cold, and then strep. It also states that if the flu and the common cold don't infect the most people, then strep will. However, it's also stated that the flu is likely to infect the most people, and hence the common cold likely won't. This means that the common cold is less likely to infect the most people than the flu. But it doesn't necessarily mean that if the flu doesn't infect the most people, strep will. It's still possible that the common cold could infect the most people if the flu doesn't. Therefore, it doesn't necessarily follow that it's likely that, if the flu doesn't infect the most people, strep will.\n\nAnswer: No",
