    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it\u2019s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be. Moreover, it\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

Make sure not to answer with 'Answer:' until *after* you think step by step and explain your reasoning.",

            "content": "The question states that if bananas aren't the top seller, then if apples aren't, oranges will be. It also states that it's likely apples will be top and hence bananas won't be. If we combine these two statements, we can infer that if apples aren't the top-selling fruit, then oranges will be. This is because the first statement establishes that if neither apples nor bananas are the top seller, then oranges will be. The second statement establishes that it's likely that bananas won't be the top seller. Therefore, if apples aren't the top seller, it's likely that oranges will be, because bananas likely won't be.\n\nAnswer: yes",
