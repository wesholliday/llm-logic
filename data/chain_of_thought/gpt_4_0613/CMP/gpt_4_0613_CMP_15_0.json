    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the stock market, real estate market, and bond market are the primary investment vehicles. According to financial advisors, the stock market likely will see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns. These markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn\u2019t have the highest returns, then if stocks don\u2019t, bonds will. Moreover, stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if stocks don\u2019t have the highest returns, bonds will?",

            "content": "The question is asking if it's likely that, if stocks don't have the highest returns, bonds will. According to the information given, the stock market is expected to have the highest returns, followed by real estate, and then bonds. This means that if stocks don't have the highest returns, the next likely candidate would be real estate, not bonds. The statement \"if real estate doesn\u2019t have the highest returns, then if stocks don\u2019t, bonds will\" is a conditional statement that only applies if real estate doesn't have the highest returns. However, the scenario we're considering is if stocks don't have the highest returns, which doesn't necessarily mean that real estate won't. Therefore, it doesn't follow that if stocks don't have the highest returns, bonds will.\n\nAnswer: No",
