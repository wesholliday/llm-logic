    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the Lakers, Warriors, and Celtics have the best odds to win the NBA championship. Based on expert projections, it is most likely the Lakers will win, followed closely by the Warriors, with the Celtics having much lower odds. These are the only top contenders, so if the Warriors don\u2019t win, then if the Lakers don\u2019t win, the Celtics will win. Moreover, it is most likely the Lakers will win and hence that the Warriors won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the Lakers don\u2019t win, the Celtics will?",

Make sure not to answer with 'Answer:' until *after* you think step by step and explain your reasoning.",

            "content": "The question is asking whether, given that the Lakers are most likely to win, it is likely that if the Lakers don't win, the Celtics will. The information provided states that if the Lakers and Warriors don't win, the Celtics will. However, it also states that the Warriors have the second highest odds of winning, with the Celtics having much lower odds. Therefore, if the Lakers don't win, it's more likely that the Warriors will win than the Celtics. The statement \"if the Lakers don\u2019t win, the Celtics will win\" would only be likely if the Warriors were not in the equation or had lower odds than the Celtics, which is not the case here. So, it does not follow that it is likely that, if the Lakers don\u2019t win, the Celtics will. \n\nAnswer: No",
