    "user_prompt": "Suppose that banana bread, chocolate chip cookies, and carrot cake are the most popular baked goods. According to a consumer survey, it is very likely that banana bread will be the top seller, followed closely by chocolate chip cookies, with carrot cake far behind. These are the only top sellers, so if chocolate chip cookies aren\u2019t the top seller, then if banana bread isn\u2019t, carrot cake will be. Moreover, it is likely banana bread will be top and hence that chocolate chip cookies won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if banana bread isn\u2019t the top seller, carrot cake will be?",

            "content": "The question presents a scenario where banana bread, chocolate chip cookies, and carrot cake are the top sellers. It is stated that banana bread is very likely to be the top seller, followed by chocolate chip cookies, and then carrot cake. It is also stated that if neither banana bread nor chocolate chip cookies are the top sellers, then carrot cake will be. \n\nThe question then asks if it follows that it is likely that, if banana bread isn\u2019t the top seller, carrot cake will be. \n\nTo answer this, we need to consider the likelihood of each scenario. \n\nFirstly, it is stated that it is very likely that banana bread will be the top seller. This means that the likelihood of banana bread not being the top seller is very low. \n\nSecondly, it is stated that if banana bread isn\u2019t the top seller, then if chocolate chip cookies aren\u2019t, carrot cake will be. This means that for carrot cake to be the top seller, both banana bread and chocolate chip cookies would have to not be the top sellers. \n\nGiven that it is very likely that banana bread will be the top seller, and that it is also likely that chocolate chip cookies will be the second top seller, the likelihood of both of these not being the top sellers (and hence carrot cake being the top seller) is very low. \n\nTherefore, it does not follow that it is likely that, if banana bread isn\u2019t the top seller, carrot cake will be. \n\nAnswer: No.",
