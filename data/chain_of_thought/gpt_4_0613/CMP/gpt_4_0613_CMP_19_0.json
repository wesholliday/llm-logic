    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don\u2019t increase the most, then if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won\u2019t increase the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

            "content": "The question is asking if, given the information provided, it's likely that if rents don't increase the most, then mortgage rates will increase the most. The information provided states that economists project rents will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. It also states that if home prices don\u2019t increase the most, then if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. However, it's also stated that rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won\u2019t increase the most. This means that the only scenario in which mortgage rates would increase the most is if both rents and home prices don't increase the most. But since it's stated that rents are likely to increase the most, the scenario in which rents don't increase the most is unlikely. Therefore, it's unlikely that mortgage rates will increase the most if rents don't increase the most.\n\nAnswer: No",
