    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Ford, Toyota, and Honda lead US auto sales. Industry analysis expects Ford will sell the most vehicles this year, followed closely by Toyota, with Honda lagging significantly behind. These brands lead the market, so if Toyota isn\u2019t #1 in sales, then if Ford isn\u2019t, Honda will be. Moreover, Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Ford doesn\u2019t lead in sales, Honda will?",

            "content": "The question presents a scenario where Ford, Toyota, and Honda are the leading auto sales companies in the US. It is expected that Ford will sell the most vehicles this year, followed by Toyota, with Honda significantly behind. The statement also suggests that if neither Ford nor Toyota is leading in sales, then Honda will be the leader. \n\nHowever, the question also states that Ford is likely to lead in sales, which implies that Toyota likely won't. This does not necessarily mean that if Ford doesn't lead in sales, Honda will. The statement only suggests that if neither Ford nor Toyota is leading, then Honda will. But it doesn't provide any likelihood or probability of this happening. \n\nTherefore, it does not logically follow from the given information that if Ford doesn't lead in sales, it is likely that Honda will. \n\nAnswer: No",
