    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it\u2019s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn\u2019t get the offer, then if Priya doesn\u2019t, Diego will. Moreover, it\u2019s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn\u2019t get the offer, Diego will?",

The hiring manager thinks it's most likely that Priya will get the offer, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. This means that if Priya doesn't get the offer, Julian is the next most likely candidate. However, the question also states that if Julian doesn't get the offer, then Diego will. This means that if Priya doesn't get the offer, Julian is the next in line, but if Julian also doesn't get the offer, then Diego will. Therefore, it's not necessarily likely that Diego will get the offer if Priya doesn't, because Julian is still in the running. \n\nAnswer: No",
