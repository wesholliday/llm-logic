    "user_prompt": "Suppose that spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons. Forecasts show it's likely most vacations this year will happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with many fewer happening in the winter. These are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. Moreover, spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning; then when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Make sure not to answer with 'Answer:' until *after* you think step by step and explain your reasoning.",

It also states that if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. This means that if spring and summer don't have the most vacations, then winter will. The question also states that spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. This means that it's unlikely for summer to have the most vacations. Therefore, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, then it's likely that winter will, because summer is unlikely to have the most vacations and winter is the only other option. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
