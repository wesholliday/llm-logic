    "user_prompt": "Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it\u2019s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn\u2019t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn\u2019t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?",

            "content": "The question is asking if it's likely that wind power will generate the most electricity if tidal power doesn't. The information given states that tidal power is forecasted to generate the most electricity, followed by solar power, with wind power significantly behind. This means that if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, the next likely candidate would be solar power, not wind power. The statement also mentions that if solar power doesn\u2019t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn\u2019t, wind power will. However, this is under the assumption that solar power doesn't generate the most, which is not the case if tidal power doesn't generate the most. Therefore, it does not follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will.\n\nAnswer: No",
