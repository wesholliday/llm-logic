    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians are the leading political parties. Based on recent polling, the Democrats likely will gain the most new voters, followed by Republicans, with Libertarians trailing distantly. These are the only major parties, so if Republicans don\u2019t gain the most voters, then if Democrats don\u2019t, Libertarians will. Moreover, Democrats likely will gain the most voters and hence Republicans likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will?",

The information given states that Democrats are likely to gain the most voters, followed by Republicans, with Libertarians trailing distantly. This means that if Democrats don't gain the most voters, it is more likely that Republicans will, not Libertarians, because Republicans are second in line in terms of likely voter gain. The Libertarians are a distant third, so even if Democrats don't gain the most voters, it doesn't necessarily mean Libertarians will. It's more likely that Republicans will. Therefore, it does not follow that it is likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will.\n\nAnswer: No",
