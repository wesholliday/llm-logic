    "user_prompt": "Suppose that thrillers, romances, and mysteries are the top-selling fiction genres. Publishing data indicates thrillers will likely be the #1 genre this year, followed closely by romances, with mysteries far behind. These genres lead the market, so if romances aren\u2019t #1, then if thrillers aren\u2019t, mysteries will be. Moreover, thrillers likely will lead sales and hence romances likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if thrillers aren\u2019t #1, mysteries will be?",

This means that if thrillers are not the top-selling genre, then mysteries will be the top-selling genre, but only if romances are also not the top-selling genre. The question also states that thrillers are likely to be the top-selling genre this year, which implies that romances likely won\u2019t be. So, if thrillers aren't #1, then romances aren't #1 either. Therefore, if thrillers aren't #1, mysteries will be. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
