    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options in a city. According to ridership data, Uber likely will have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. These are the only major transportation providers, so if Lyft doesn\u2019t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. Moreover, Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won\u2019t give the most rides. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will?",

            "content": "The question is asking if it's likely that, if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will. The information provided states that Uber is likely to give the most rides, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. It also states that if Lyft doesn\u2019t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. However, it's also stated that Lyft likely won\u2019t give the most rides because Uber likely will. \n\nGiven this information, if Uber doesn't give the most rides, the next likely candidate according to the data would be Lyft, not taxis. Taxis are only likely to give the most rides if both Uber and Lyft don't, which is unlikely according to the data. Therefore, it does not follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will. \n\nAnswer: No",
