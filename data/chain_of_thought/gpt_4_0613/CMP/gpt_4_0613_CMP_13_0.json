    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

Make sure not to answer with 'Answer:' until *after* you think step by step and explain your reasoning.",

            "content": "The statement suggests that if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. However, it also states that Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. This means that the condition for Missouri to add the most jobs (i.e., Georgia not adding the most jobs) is likely to be met. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will. This is because the statement doesn't provide any information about what happens if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs. It only provides information about what happens if Georgia doesn't add the most jobs. Therefore, it doesn't necessarily follow that if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will.\n\nAnswer: No",
