    "user_prompt": "Suppose that India, China, and Russia are the world's leading emerging economies. Economists project it's likely India's economy will grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind. These are by far the biggest emerging economies, so if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn\u2019t, Russia will be. Moreover, India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if India isn\u2019t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be?",

The information given states that India's economy is projected to grow the fastest, followed by China, with Russia lagging behind. It also states that if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn\u2019t, Russia will be. However, it's also stated that India's economy is likely to grow the fastest, and hence China's likely won't. This means that if India isn't the top-growing economy, then China likely won't be either. Given that Russia's growth rate is lagging distantly behind India and China, it's unlikely that Russia would be the top-growing economy if India isn't. \n\nAnswer: No",
