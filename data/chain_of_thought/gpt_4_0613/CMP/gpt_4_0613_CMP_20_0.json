    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",

Make sure not to answer with 'Answer:' until *after* you think step by step and explain your reasoning.",

            "content": "The question is asking if it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. The information given states that coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda being consumed much less in the mornings. It also states that if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Since it's stated that coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers, it follows that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers (which is unlikely), soda will retain the most morning drinkers. This is because, according to the information given, if tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers (which is likely since coffee is likely to retain the most), then if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nAnswer: yes",
