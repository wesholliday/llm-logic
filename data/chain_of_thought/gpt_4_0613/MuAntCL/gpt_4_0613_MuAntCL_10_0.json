It does not provide any information about whether the document was notarized or not. Notarization is a separate process from signing, and it involves a notary public verifying the identities of the signers and their understanding and willingness to sign the document. Therefore, we cannot infer that the document was notarized based solely on the information that it was signed.\n\nAnswer: no",
