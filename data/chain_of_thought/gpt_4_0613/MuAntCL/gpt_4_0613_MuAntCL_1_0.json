It does not provide any specific details about where upstairs the envelope was located. The addition of 'under a bed' is an extra detail that is not supported or suggested by the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that the envelope was under a bed based solely on the information that it was upstairs.\n\nAnswer: No",
