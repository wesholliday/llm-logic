This means that shanking the whiffle necessarily leads to it tinkering. \n\nThe second statement tells us that it's not the case that the whiffle must have tinked. This means that the condition for the whiffle being shanked (it tinkering) did not occur.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can infer that the whiffle was not shanked. If it had been shanked, it would have had to tinker, but we know that it did not tinker. Therefore, it could not have been shanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
