This means that being surned is a necessary condition for the fleeg to have been bluttered. \n\nThe second statement tells us that it's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned. This means that the necessary condition for the fleeg to have been bluttered is not met.\n\nTherefore, if the necessary condition for the fleeg to have been bluttered is not met, we can infer that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
