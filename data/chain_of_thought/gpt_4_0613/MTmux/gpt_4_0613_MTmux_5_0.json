This means that being smoogled is a necessary condition for being fraggled. \n\nThe second statement tells us that it's not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled. This means that the necessary condition for being fraggled is not met.\n\nTherefore, if the necessary condition for being fraggled is not met, then the zinger could not have been fraggled. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
