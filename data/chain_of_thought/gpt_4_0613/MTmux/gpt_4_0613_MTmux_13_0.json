It's not the case that the glip must have tragged.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, where the slogging of the glip leads to the glip tragging. The second statement negates the result of the first statement, saying that the glip did not tragg.\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P then Q\", and we know that \"Not Q\" is true, then we can infer \"Not P\". This is known as Modus Tollens in logic.\n\nHere, \"P\" is \"the glip was slogged\" and \"Q\" is \"the glip must have tragged\". Given that \"Not Q\" is true (from the second statement), we can infer \"Not P\", which is \"The glip was not slogged\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
