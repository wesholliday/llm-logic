This means that snurgling the fribble will always result in it crinking. \n\nThe second statement tells us that it's not the case that the fribble must have crinked. This means that the fribble did not crink. \n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can infer that the fribble was not snurgled. This is because if it had been snurgled, it would have crinked, but we know that it did not crink. Therefore, the fribble must not have been snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
