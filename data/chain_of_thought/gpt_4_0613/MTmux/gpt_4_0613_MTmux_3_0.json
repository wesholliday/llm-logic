This is a conditional statement, where the morphing of the splat leads to it quanking. \n\nThe second statement tells us that it's not the case that the splat must have quanked. This means that the condition for the splat being morphed (it quanking) did not occur.\n\nIn a conditional statement, if the result (the splat quanking) did not occur, then the condition that leads to it (the splat being morphed) could not have occurred. This is known as modus tollens in logic.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
