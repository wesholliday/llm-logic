This means that being plooked necessitates being nugged. \n\nThe second statement tells us that it's not the case that the shank must have been nugged. This means that the condition for being plooked (which is being nugged) is not met.\n\nTherefore, if the condition for being plooked is not met, we can infer that the shank was not plooked. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
