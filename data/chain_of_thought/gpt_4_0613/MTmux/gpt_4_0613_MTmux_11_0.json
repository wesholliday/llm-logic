This means that being zimmed is a necessary condition for being blummed. \n\nThe second statement tells us that it's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed. This means that the necessary condition for the flug being blummed is not met.\n\nTherefore, if the necessary condition for the flug being blummed is not met, then we can infer that the flug was not blummed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
