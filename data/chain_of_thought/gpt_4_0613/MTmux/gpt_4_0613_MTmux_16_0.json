The conditional statement is \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink\". The negation is \"It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink\". \n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement of the form \"If P then Q\", and we know that Q is false, then we can infer that P is also false. This is known as modus tollens. \n\nIn this case, P is \"the sneg was crampled\" and Q is \"the sneg must have sproted the frink\". We know that Q is false, because it's given that \"It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink\". Therefore, we can infer that P is also false, i.e., \"The sneg was not crampled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
