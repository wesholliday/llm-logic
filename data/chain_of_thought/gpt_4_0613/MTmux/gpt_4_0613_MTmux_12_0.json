This is a conditional statement where the shripping of the smip leads to the lupping of the zoint. \n\nThe second statement tells us that it's not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint. This means that the condition for the smip being shripped (which is the smip lupping the zoint) did not occur.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can infer that the smip was not shripped. If it had been, then it would have had to lup the zoint, but we know from the second statement that it did not lup the zoint. Therefore, the condition for the smip being shripped was not met, so the smip was not shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
