The second statement contradicts the result of the first statement, saying that it's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink. \n\nIf we assume that the first statement is true, then the only way for the second statement to also be true is if the condition in the first statement (the grommet was sploffed) did not occur. This is because if the grommet was sploffed, then according to the first statement, it must have plopped the frink, which contradicts the second statement. \n\nTherefore, if both statements are true, we can infer that the grommet was not sploffed. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
