The first statement, \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged\", can be interpreted as \"If P (the smonk was vreebled), then Q (the smonk must have plagged)\". \n\nThe second statement, \"It's not the case that the smonk must have plagged\", is the negation of Q (Not Q). \n\nIn logic, if we have an implication \"If P, then Q\", and we know that Q is false (Not Q), then we can infer that P is also false (Not P). This is known as Modus Tollens. \n\nSo, in this case, if we know that \"the smonk must have plagged\" is false, we can infer that \"the smonk was vreebled\" is also false. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
