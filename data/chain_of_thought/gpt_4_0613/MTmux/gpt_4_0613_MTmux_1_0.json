This means that being blimmed is a sufficient condition for being zargled. In other words, if we know that the flugel was blimmed, we can be sure that it was also zargled.\n\nThe second statement tells us that it's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled. This means that the condition for being zargled is not met.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that the flugel was not blimmed. If it had been blimmed, it would have had to be zargled, but we know that it was not zargled. Therefore, it could not have been blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
