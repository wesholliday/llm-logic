This means that vroombing the dreb necessarily leads to it being spened. \n\nThe second statement tells us that it's not the case that the dreb must have been spened. This means that the condition for vroombing the dreb (which is it being spened) did not occur.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can infer that the dreb was not vroombed. If it had been vroombed, it would have had to be spened, but we know that it was not spened. Therefore, it could not have been vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
