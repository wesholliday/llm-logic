The conditional statement is \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged\". The negation is \"It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged\". \n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement of the form \"If P then Q\", and we know that Q is false, then we can infer that P is also false. This is known as modus tollens. \n\nIn this case, \"the clug was fleeked\" is P and \"the clug must have been snugged\" is Q. We know that Q is false, because it's given that \"It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged\". Therefore, we can infer that P, \"the clug was fleeked\", is also false. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
