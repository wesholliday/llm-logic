In this case, P is \"the wug was flooped\" and Q is \"the wug must have bimmed the zoint\". \n\nThe second statement is a negation of Q, which can be represented as \"not Q\". \n\nAccording to the rules of logic, if \"If P, then Q\" is true and \"not Q\" is also true, then we can infer \"not P\". This is known as Modus Tollens in logic. \n\nSo, if \"the wug was flooped\" leads to \"the wug must have bimmed the zoint\", and it's not the case that \"the wug must have bimmed the zoint\", then we can infer that \"the wug was not flooped\". \n\nAnswer: Yes",
