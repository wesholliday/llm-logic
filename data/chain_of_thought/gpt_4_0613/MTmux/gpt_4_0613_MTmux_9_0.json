This means that being varnished is a necessary condition for the twonk being plinked. \n\nThe second statement tells us that it's not the case that the twonk must have been varnished. This means that the necessary condition for the twonk being plinked is not met.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can infer that the twonk was not plinked. If it had been plinked, it would have had to be varnished, but we know that it was not varnished. Therefore, it could not have been plinked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
