In this case, the cake being chocolate is the condition for the muffins being blueberry. However, the reverse is not necessarily true. The muffins being blueberry does not guarantee that the cake was chocolate. The muffins could be blueberry for a variety of other reasons. Therefore, from the statement 'The muffins were blueberry', we cannot deduce 'The cake was chocolate'. \n\nAnswer: No",
