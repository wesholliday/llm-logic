The book is a mystery novel.\n\nFrom these statements, we can't directly deduce that the book was written by James. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the book was written by James, it would definitely be a mystery novel. However, it doesn't mean that if a book is a mystery novel, it was definitely written by James. There could be many other authors who write mystery novels. The second statement only tells us that the book is a mystery novel, but it doesn't tell us anything about the author. Therefore, we can't deduce that the book was written by James based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
