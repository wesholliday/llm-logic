The first statement is a conditional statement, where the presence of the griffin in the forest implies the presence of the unicorn. However, the second statement only confirms the presence of the unicorn in the forest. It does not provide any information about the griffin's location. Therefore, from these two statements, we cannot deduce that the griffin was in the forest. \n\nAnswer: No",
