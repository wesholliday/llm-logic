However, knowing that 'Amy played tennis' does not necessarily mean that 'Jeff played basketball'. Amy could have played tennis for a variety of reasons, not necessarily because Jeff played basketball. The statement does not say that Amy only plays tennis if Jeff plays basketball. Therefore, we cannot deduce that 'Jeff played basketball' from the information given. \n\nAnswer: no",
