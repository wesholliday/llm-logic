The first statement is a conditional statement, where Lisa buying the red shirt is a sufficient condition for Mark buying the blue shirt. However, it does not mean that Mark buying the blue shirt is a necessary condition for Lisa buying the red shirt. The second statement tells us that Mark bought the blue shirt, but it does not provide any information about whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not. Therefore, from these two statements, we cannot deduce that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
