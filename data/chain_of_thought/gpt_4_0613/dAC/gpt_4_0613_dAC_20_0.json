            "content": "The statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' is a conditional statement. It tells us that if a certain condition (the apple being red) is true, then another condition (the banana being yellow) is also true. However, it does not tell us that the reverse is true. In other words, it does not tell us that if the banana is yellow, then the apple must be red. The banana could be yellow for a variety of reasons that have nothing to do with the color of the apple. Therefore, from the statement 'The banana was yellow', we cannot deduce 'The apple was red'. \n\nAnswer: no",
