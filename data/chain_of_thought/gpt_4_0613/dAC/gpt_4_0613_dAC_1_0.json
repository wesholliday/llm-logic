The first statement is a conditional statement, where Sue's presence at the wedding is dependent on Mary's presence. However, the second statement only confirms that Sue was at the wedding. It does not provide any information about whether Mary was at the wedding or not. Therefore, from these two statements, we cannot deduce that Mary was at the wedding. \n\nAnswer: No",
