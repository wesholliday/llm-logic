The second statement confirms that the first event (the smonk was vreebled) did indeed happen. According to the rules of logic, if a conditional statement is true and the first part of the condition (the \"if\" part) is true, then the second part of the condition (the \"then\" part) must also be true. Therefore, we can infer that the smonk plagged. \n\nAnswer: yes",
