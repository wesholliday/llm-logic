The first statement is a conditional statement, \"If P, then Q\", where P is 'the sneg was crampled' and Q is 'the sneg sproted the frink'. The second statement is affirming that P is true, 'The sneg was crampled'. According to the rules of logic, if a conditional statement is true and its antecedent (P) is true, then its consequent (Q) must also be true. Therefore, we can infer 'The sneg sproted the frink'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
