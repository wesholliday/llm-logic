The use of the conjunction \"and\" indicates that two actions might be happening to the flump: it might be gronked, and it might be shimbled. Therefore, even if we don't know what \"gronked\" or \"shimbled\" mean, we can infer from the sentence structure that it is possible for the flump to be shimbled, because it is one of the actions mentioned.\n\nAnswer: yes",
