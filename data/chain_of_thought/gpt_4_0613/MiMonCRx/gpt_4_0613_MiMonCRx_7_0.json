The use of the conjunction \"and\" indicates that two actions might be happening to the gribble: it might be zibbered, and it might be floobed. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer from this sentence that \"The gribble might be floobed\", as this is one of the possibilities mentioned in the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
