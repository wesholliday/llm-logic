In this case, P is 'The doll was plastic' and Q is 'The truck was metal'. The argument states that if P is true, then Q must also be true. The second premise confirms that P is true. Therefore, according to Modus Ponens, Q must also be true. So, the conclusion 'The truck was metal' logically follows from the premises. \n\nAnswer: yes",
