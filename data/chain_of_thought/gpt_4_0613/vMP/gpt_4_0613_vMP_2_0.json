In this case, P is 'the griffin was in the forest' and Q is 'the unicorn was in the forest'. The argument states that if P is true (which it is, according to the second premise), then Q must also be true. Therefore, the conclusion 'The unicorn was in the forest' logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
