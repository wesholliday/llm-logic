In this case, P is 'the dog was inside' and Q is 'the cat was outside'. The argument states that if P is true (which it is, according to the second premise), then Q must also be true. Therefore, if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true, making the argument valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
