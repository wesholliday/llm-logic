In this case, P is 'the book was written by James' and Q is 'the book is a mystery novel'. The argument states that if P is true, then Q must also be true. The second premise confirms that P is true. Therefore, according to the rules of modus ponens, Q must also be true. So, the conclusion 'the book is a mystery novel' logically follows from the premises. \n\nAnswer: yes",
