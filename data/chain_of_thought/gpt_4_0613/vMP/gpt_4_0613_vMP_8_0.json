            "content": "This form of argument is known as Modus Ponens in logic. It is a valid form of argument. The structure is: If P then Q. P is true, therefore Q is true. In this case, P is 'the vampire was awake' and Q is 'the mummy was awake'. The argument states that if P is true (the vampire was awake), then Q (the mummy was awake) must also be true. The second premise confirms that P is true (the vampire was awake). Therefore, according to the rules of Modus Ponens, the conclusion that Q (the mummy was awake) is true must be valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
