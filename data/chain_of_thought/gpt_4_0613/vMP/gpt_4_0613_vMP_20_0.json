            "content": "This form of argument is known as Modus Ponens in logic. It is a form of valid reasoning which states that if a conditional statement (if p then q) is accepted, and the first part of the condition (p) is true, then the second part (q) must also be true. In this case, 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' is the conditional statement. 'The apple was red' is the first part of the condition, which is given as true. Therefore, according to Modus Ponens, the conclusion 'The banana was yellow' must also be true if the initial conditional statement is accepted. So, this form of argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
