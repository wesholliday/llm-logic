In this case, P is 'Joe went to the park' and Q is 'Lucy went to the zoo'. The argument states that if P is true, then Q must also be true. The second premise confirms that P is true. Therefore, according to the rules of Modus Ponens, Q must also be true. So, the conclusion 'Lucy went to the zoo' logically follows from the premises. \n\nAnswer: yes",
