The second statement introduces uncertainty about the first possibility, suggesting that the sunglasses might not be on her head. However, this does not confirm that the sunglasses are in her bag. The word \"might\" indicates a possibility, not a certainty. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the sunglasses are in her bag based on these two statements. \n\nAnswer: No",
