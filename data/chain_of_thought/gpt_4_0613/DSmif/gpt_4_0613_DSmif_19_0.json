The second statement introduces uncertainty about the first possibility, suggesting that the watch might not be on his wrist. However, this does not confirm that the watch is definitely charging on the dresser. It only suggests that it is a possibility. The watch could be neither on his wrist nor charging on the dresser, for example, if it has been misplaced or lost. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer from these two statements that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: No",
