The second statement introduces uncertainty about the toy being on the bookshelf. However, it does not definitively state that the toy is not on the bookshelf, only that it might not be. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the toy is in the toy box, because there is still a possibility that it could be on the bookshelf.\n\nAnswer: No",
