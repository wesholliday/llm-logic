The second statement introduces some doubt about the book being on the table, but it does not definitively state that the book is not on the table. It only suggests that it might not be on the table. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the book is on the shelf, because there is still a possibility that it could be on the table. \n\nAnswer: no",
