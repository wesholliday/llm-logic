The second statement introduces some doubt about the milk being in the fridge, but it doesn't confirm that the milk is not in the fridge. It just says that it might not be. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the milk is on the counter, because there's still a possibility that it could be in the fridge. \n\nAnswer: No",
