The second statement introduces uncertainty about the notebook being on the nightstand. However, it does not confirm that the notebook is not on the nightstand. It only suggests that it might not be there. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the notebook is in the drawer based on these two statements. The notebook could still be on the nightstand or in some other location not mentioned in the statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
