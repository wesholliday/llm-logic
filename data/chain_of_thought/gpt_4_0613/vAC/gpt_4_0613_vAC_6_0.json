In this case, P is 'Sue chose pizza' and Q is 'Bob chose pasta'. Just because Q is true (Bob chose pasta), it doesn't necessarily mean that P is true (Sue chose pizza). There could be other reasons why Bob chose pasta that have nothing to do with Sue's choice. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
