In this case, P is 'Tom watched football' and Q is 'Jen watched basketball'. Just because Q (Jen watched basketball) is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that P (Tom watched football) is also true. There could be other reasons why Jen watched basketball that have nothing to do with whether Tom watched football. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
