            "content": "The form of argument being used here is known as affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. The structure of the argument is: If P then Q, Q, therefore P. In this case, P is 'the apple was red' and Q is 'the banana was yellow'. Just because Q is true, it does not necessarily mean that P is true. The banana being yellow does not guarantee that the apple was red. The apple could have been any color. The argument would only be valid if the second premise was 'The apple was red', which would then lead to the conclusion 'The banana was yellow'. Therefore, this form of argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
