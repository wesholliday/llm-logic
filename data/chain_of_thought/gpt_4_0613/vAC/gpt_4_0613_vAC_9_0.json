In this case, P is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and Q is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. Just because Q is true (Mark bought the blue shirt), it doesn't necessarily mean that P is true (Lisa bought the red shirt). The argument would only be valid if it was structured: If P then Q, P, therefore Q. Therefore, this form of argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
