In this case, P is 'Sam took a plane' and Q is 'Erin took a train'. Just because Q is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that P is true. There could be other reasons why Erin took a train that have nothing to do with Sam taking a plane. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
