In this case, P is 'the alien visited Mars' and Q is 'the robot visited Jupiter'. Just because Q is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that P is true. The robot could have visited Jupiter for reasons unrelated to the alien visiting Mars. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
