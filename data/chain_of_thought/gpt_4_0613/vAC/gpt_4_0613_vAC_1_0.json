            "content": "The form of argument presented here is not logically valid. This is because the argument is confusing the direction of the implication. The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This does not mean that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding. The second premise states that Sue was at the wedding. However, this does not necessarily mean that Mary was at the wedding. The conclusion that Mary was at the wedding is not supported by the premises. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
