In this case, P is 'the doll was plastic' and Q is 'the truck was metal'. Just because Q is true (the truck was metal), it doesn't necessarily mean that P is true (the doll was plastic). The truck being metal could be due to a variety of reasons not related to the doll being plastic. Therefore, this form of argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
