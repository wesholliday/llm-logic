In this case, P is 'the shirt was cotton' and Q is 'the pants were denim'. Just because the consequent (Q) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (P) is true. The pants being denim could be due to a number of other factors, not just the shirt being cotton. Therefore, this form of argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
