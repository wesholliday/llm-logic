The first premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This does not mean that if Chris finished the race, then Alex must have finished the race. The two are not equivalent. The second premise states that Chris finished the race. However, this does not provide any information about whether Alex finished the race or not. Therefore, the conclusion that Alex finished the race cannot be logically derived from the given premises. \n\nAnswer: No",
