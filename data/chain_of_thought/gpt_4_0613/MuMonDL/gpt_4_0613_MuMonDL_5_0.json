            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The package must have been delivered today' implies that the delivery of the package has already occurred on the current day. The addition of 'or tomorrow' to the statement would suggest that there is a possibility for the package to be delivered the next day. However, since the original statement asserts that the package has already been delivered today, there is no need for the possibility of a delivery tomorrow. Therefore, the inference 'The package must have been delivered today or tomorrow' does not logically follow from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
