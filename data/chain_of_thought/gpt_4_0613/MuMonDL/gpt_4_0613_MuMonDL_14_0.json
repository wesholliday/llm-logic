It only states that the contract was valid for a year. The phrase \"or longer\" would imply that the contract could have been valid for more than a year, which is not stated or implied in the original sentence. Therefore, we cannot infer that the contract was valid for a year or longer based solely on the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: no",
