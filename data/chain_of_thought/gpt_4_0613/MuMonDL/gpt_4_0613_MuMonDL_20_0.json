This is because a black-tie event is a type of formal event. Therefore, if we know that the event was formal, it could have been a black-tie event, but it also could have been another type of formal event. So, we can infer that 'The event must have been formal or black-tie' from 'The event must have been formal'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
