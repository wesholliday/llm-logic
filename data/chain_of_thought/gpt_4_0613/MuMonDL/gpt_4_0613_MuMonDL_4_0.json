The second statement is a logical disjunction, meaning that if either part of it is true, then the whole statement is true. Since we know that the meeting was scheduled for 2 PM, the first part of the disjunction is true, which makes the whole statement true, regardless of whether or not the meeting was rescheduled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
