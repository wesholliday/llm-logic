The addition of 'or as requested' suggests that there could be instances where the room is cleaned upon request, which is not explicitly stated or implied in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The room must have been cleaned daily or as requested' from 'The room must have been cleaned daily' because the latter does not provide any information about cleaning upon request.\n\nAnswer: No",
