            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays' is a subset of the statement 'The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays or had limited hours'. This is because the latter statement includes the possibility of the restaurant being closed on Mondays, but also includes the additional possibility of the restaurant having limited hours. Therefore, if we know that the restaurant was closed on Mondays, it is also true that the restaurant was either closed on Mondays or had limited hours.\n\nAnswer: yes",
