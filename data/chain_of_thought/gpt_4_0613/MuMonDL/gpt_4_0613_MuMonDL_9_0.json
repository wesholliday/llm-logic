This is because the latter statement includes all situations where the flight was delayed, but also includes additional situations where the flight was rescheduled. Therefore, if we know that 'The flight must have been delayed', it is also true that 'The flight must have been delayed or rescheduled', because the first statement is included within the second.\n\nAnswer: yes",
