The second statement 'The envelope must be under a bed or upstairs' is a broader location that includes the first statement. If the envelope is under a bed, it is also true that it is either under a bed or upstairs, because the 'under a bed' condition is met. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
