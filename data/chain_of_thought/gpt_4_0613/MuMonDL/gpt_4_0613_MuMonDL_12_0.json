If the project was not completed by Friday, it would be late. The statement 'The project must have been completed by Friday or next week' implies that the deadline for the project could be any time up to the end of the following week. This is a more lenient deadline than the original statement. Therefore, the second statement cannot be inferred from the first because it changes the original deadline.\n\nAnswer: no",
