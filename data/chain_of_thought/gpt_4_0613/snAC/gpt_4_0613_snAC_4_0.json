The first statement is a conditional statement, where the robot visiting Jupiter is the result of the alien visiting Mars. However, the second statement only confirms the result of the first statement, not the condition. It does not provide any information about whether the alien visited Mars or not. The robot could have visited Jupiter for a reason unrelated to the alien visiting Mars. Therefore, it does not necessarily follow that 'The alien visited Mars' is true. \n\nAnswer: no",
