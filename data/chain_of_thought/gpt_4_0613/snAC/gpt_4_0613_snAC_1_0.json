            "content": "The statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement. It means that if the first part (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true. However, it does not mean that if the second part is true, then the first part must also be true. This is a common logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. Therefore, even though 'Sue was at the wedding' is true, we cannot necessarily conclude that 'Mary was at the wedding' is also true. \n\nAnswer: No",
