However, it does not mean that whenever Kate eats salad, Ben must have eaten pasta. Kate could have eaten salad for any number of reasons unrelated to Ben's pasta consumption. Therefore, even if 'Kate ate salad' is true, it does not necessarily mean that 'Ben ate pasta' is true. The truth of the second statement does not guarantee the truth of the first. \n\nAnswer: No",
