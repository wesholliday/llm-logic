The first statement is a conditional statement, meaning if the first part (the book was written by James) is true, then the second part (the book is a mystery novel) must be true. However, the reverse is not necessarily true. Just because the book is a mystery novel, it does not mean that it was written by James. There could be many other authors who write mystery novels. Therefore, even though the book is a mystery novel, we cannot definitively say that it was written by James.\n\nAnswer: no",
