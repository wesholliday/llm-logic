However, it does not mean that whenever Jen watches basketball, Tom watches football. The truth of Jen watching basketball does not necessarily imply that Tom watched football. This is because there could be other reasons why Jen watched basketball. Therefore, it does not necessarily follow that 'Tom watched football' is true just because 'Jen watched basketball' is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
