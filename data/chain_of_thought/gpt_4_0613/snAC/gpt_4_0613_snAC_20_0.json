            "content": "The given statements are examples of conditional statements, specifically in the form of \"If P, then Q\". The first statement, \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\", means that the redness of the apple is a sufficient condition for the yellowness of the banana. However, it does not mean that the redness of the apple is a necessary condition for the banana to be yellow. The banana could be yellow for other reasons not related to the apple's color. The second statement, \"The banana was yellow\", only confirms the 'Q' part of the conditional statement, but it does not provide any information about the 'P' part, which is the color of the apple. Therefore, from these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that the apple was red. \n\nAnswer: no",
