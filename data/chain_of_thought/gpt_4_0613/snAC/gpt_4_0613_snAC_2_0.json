The first statement is a conditional statement, where the presence of the griffin in the forest implies the presence of the unicorn. However, the reverse is not necessarily true. The presence of the unicorn in the forest does not imply the presence of the griffin. The second statement confirms that the unicorn was in the forest, but it does not provide any information about the griffin. Therefore, from these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that the griffin was in the forest.\n\nAnswer: No",
