The first statement is a conditional statement, where the vampire being awake is a sufficient condition for the mummy being awake. However, it does not imply that the vampire being awake is a necessary condition for the mummy being awake. The mummy could be awake for other reasons not related to the vampire's state. The second statement only confirms that the mummy was awake, but it does not provide any information about the vampire's state. Therefore, from these two statements, we cannot necessarily conclude that the vampire was awake. \n\nAnswer: No",
