The first statement is a conditional statement, where the occurrence of the second event (muffins being blueberry) is dependent on the first event (cake being chocolate). However, the occurrence of the first event is not dependent on the second event. \n\nIn other words, the fact that the muffins were blueberry does not necessarily mean that the cake was chocolate. The muffins could be blueberry for a variety of other reasons. Therefore, it does not necessarily follow that 'The cake was chocolate' is true just because 'The muffins were blueberry' is true.\n\nAnswer: No",
