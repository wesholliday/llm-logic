The first statement is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (the car was red) is true, then the second part (the truck was blue) must also be true. However, the truth of the second part (the truck was blue) does not necessarily mean the first part (the car was red) is true. The truck could be blue for a variety of reasons that have nothing to do with the color of the car. This is a common logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. Answer: no.",
