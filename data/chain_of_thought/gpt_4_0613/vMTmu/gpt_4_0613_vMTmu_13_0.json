            "content": "The form of argument being used here is known as Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens is a valid form of argument. It works like this: If P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must also be false. In this case, P is 'the car was red' and Q is 'the truck must have been blue'. The argument states that if the car was red (P), then the truck must have been blue (Q). It then states that it's not the case that the truck must have been blue (Q is false). Therefore, according to Modus Tollens, the car was not red (P is false). So, this form of argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
