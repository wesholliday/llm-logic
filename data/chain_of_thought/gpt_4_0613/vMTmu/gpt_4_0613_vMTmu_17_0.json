Not Q. Therefore, not P. In this case, P is 'Ben ate pasta' and Q is 'Kate must have eaten salad'. The first premise states 'If P, then Q', the second premise states 'Not Q', and the conclusion is 'Not P'. Therefore, the argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens and is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
