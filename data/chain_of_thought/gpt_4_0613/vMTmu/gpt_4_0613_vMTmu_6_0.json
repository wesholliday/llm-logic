            "content": "The form of argument being used here is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus tollens works like this: if we have a conditional statement (if P then Q), and we know that Q is false, then we can conclude that P is also false. In this case, P is 'Sue chose pizza' and Q is 'Bob must have chosen pasta'. The argument tells us that if P then Q, and that Q is false. Therefore, according to modus tollens, P must also be false. So, if it's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza. This makes the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
