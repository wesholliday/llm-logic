            "content": "The form of argument being used here is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens works like this: if we have a conditional statement (if P then Q), and we know that Q is not true, then we can conclude that P is also not true. In this case, P is 'the cake was chocolate' and Q is 'the muffins must have been blueberry'. The second premise tells us that Q is not true, so we can conclude that P is not true, which is exactly what the conclusion states. Therefore, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
