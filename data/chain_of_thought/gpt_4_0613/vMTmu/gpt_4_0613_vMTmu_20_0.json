            "content": "The form of argument being used here is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens works like this: if we have a conditional statement (if P then Q), and we know that Q is not true, then we can conclude that P is also not true. In this case, P is 'the apple was red' and Q is 'the banana must have been yellow'. The argument tells us that if P then Q, and that Q is not the case. Therefore, we can conclude that P is not the case. So, the argument 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow', 'It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow', therefore 'The apple was not red' is a valid argument. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
