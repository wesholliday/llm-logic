            "content": "The form of argument presented here is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. The structure of Modus Tollens is as follows: If P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P. In this case, P is 'the bear was in the cave' and Q is 'the wolf must have been in the den'. The argument states that if P then Q, and it is not the case that Q, so it logically follows that it is not the case that P. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
