In this case, P is 'the shirt was cotton' and Q is 'the pants must have been denim'. The argument states: If the shirt was cotton (P), then the pants must have been denim (Q). It's not the case that the pants must have been denim (not Q). Therefore, the shirt was not cotton (not P). This is a valid form of argument in logic. \n\nAnswer: yes",
