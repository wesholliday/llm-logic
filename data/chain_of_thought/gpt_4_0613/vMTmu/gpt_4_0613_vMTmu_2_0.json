            "content": "The form of argument being used here is known as Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens is a valid form of argument. It works like this: If P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must also be false. In this case, P is 'the griffin was in the forest' and Q is 'the unicorn must have been in the forest'. The argument states that if P is true, then Q is true. It then states that Q is false. Therefore, according to Modus Tollens, P must also be false. So, if the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest. This matches the conclusion of the argument, so the argument is valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
