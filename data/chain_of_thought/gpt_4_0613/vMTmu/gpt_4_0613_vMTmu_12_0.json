The structure of Modus Tollens is as follows: If P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P. In this case, P is 'Joe went to the park' and Q is 'Lucy must have gone to the zoo'. The argument states that if P then Q, and it is not the case that Q, so it logically follows that it is not the case that P. Therefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
