Not Q. Therefore, not P. In this case, P is 'the doll was plastic' and Q is 'the truck must have been metal'. The first premise states 'If P, then Q', and the second premise states 'Not Q'. Therefore, according to Modus Tollens, it is logically valid to conclude 'Not P', or 'The doll was not plastic'. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
