            "content": "The form of argument being used here is known as Modus Tollens. Modus Tollens is a valid form of argument. It works like this: If P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must also be false. In this case, P is 'the vampire was awake' and Q is 'the mummy must have been awake'. The first premise states that if P then Q. The second premise states that not Q. Therefore, according to Modus Tollens, it must be the case that not P. So, the conclusion that 'the vampire was not awake' follows logically from the premises. \n\nAnswer: yes",
