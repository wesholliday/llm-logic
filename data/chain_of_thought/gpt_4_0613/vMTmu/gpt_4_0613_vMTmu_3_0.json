The structure of Modus Tollens is as follows: If P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P. In this case, P is 'the book was written by James' and Q is 'the book must be a mystery novel'. The first premise states 'If P, then Q', the second premise states 'Not Q', and the conclusion is 'Not P'. Therefore, the argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens and is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
