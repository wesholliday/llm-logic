Therefore, not P. \n\nIn this case, P is 'Tom watched football' and Q is 'Jen must have watched basketball'. The argument states that if P then Q, and it is not the case that Q, so it concludes not P. \n\nThis is a valid form of argument in classical logic. If the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid. \n\nAnswer: yes",
