Not Q. Therefore, not P. \n\nIn this case, P is 'the alien visited Mars' and Q is 'the robot must have visited Jupiter'. The first premise states 'If P, then Q'. The second premise states 'Not Q'. Therefore, according to modus tollens, it is logically valid to conclude 'Not P', or 'The alien did not visit Mars'. \n\nAnswer: yes",
