            "content": "No, we cannot logically infer that 'The doll was plastic' from these statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (the doll was plastic) is true, then the second part (the truck was metal) must also be true. However, knowing that the second part (the truck was metal) is true does not necessarily mean that the first part (the doll was plastic) is also true. This is a common logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. The truck being metal could be due to a variety of other reasons not mentioned in the statements. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the doll was plastic. \n\nAnswer: No",
