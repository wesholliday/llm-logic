However, the statement 'The robot visited Jupiter' does not necessarily mean that the condition (the alien visiting Mars) was met. The robot could have visited Jupiter for a different reason. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that 'The alien visited Mars' from these two statements. \n\nAnswer: No",
