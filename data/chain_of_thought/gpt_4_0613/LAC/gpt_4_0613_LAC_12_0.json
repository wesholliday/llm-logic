It tells us that Joe going to the park is a sufficient condition for Lucy going to the zoo. However, it does not tell us that Joe going to the park is a necessary condition for Lucy going to the zoo. In other words, Lucy could go to the zoo whether or not Joe goes to the park. Therefore, knowing that 'Lucy went to the zoo' does not allow us to infer that 'Joe went to the park'. \n\nAnswer: no",
