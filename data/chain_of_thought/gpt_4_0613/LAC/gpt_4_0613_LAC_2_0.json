The first statement is a conditional statement, where the presence of the griffin in the forest implies the presence of the unicorn. However, the second statement only confirms the presence of the unicorn in the forest. It does not provide any information about the presence of the griffin. The presence of the unicorn does not necessarily mean the griffin was also there, according to the given statements. The griffin could be elsewhere, and the unicorn could still be in the forest. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that 'The griffin was in the forest' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
