In this statement, the apple being red is a sufficient condition for the banana being yellow. However, it does not mean that the banana being yellow is a sufficient condition for the apple being red. The banana could be yellow for other reasons not related to the apple's color. Therefore, from the statement 'The banana was yellow', we cannot logically infer 'The apple was red'. \n\nAnswer: no",
