It tells us that if a certain condition (Sam taking a plane) is true, then a certain result (Erin taking a train) will also be true. However, it does not tell us that the reverse is true. In other words, it does not tell us that if Erin took a train, then Sam must have taken a plane. Therefore, even though we know that Erin took a train, we cannot logically infer from this information alone that Sam took a plane. \n\nAnswer: no",
