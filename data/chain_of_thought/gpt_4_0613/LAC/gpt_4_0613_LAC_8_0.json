The first statement is a conditional statement, where the vampire being awake is a sufficient condition for the mummy being awake. However, it does not state that the vampire being awake is a necessary condition for the mummy being awake. The mummy could be awake for other reasons not related to the vampire's state. Therefore, even though we know that the mummy was awake, we cannot logically infer that the vampire was awake. \n\nAnswer: No",
