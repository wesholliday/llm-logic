            "content": "The statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement. It tells us what will happen (Mark will buy the blue shirt) if a certain condition is met (Lisa buys the red shirt). However, it does not tell us what will happen if the result (Mark buying the blue shirt) occurs without the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) being met. Therefore, even though we know that Mark bought the blue shirt, we cannot logically infer from this information alone that Lisa bought the red shirt. The original statement does not tell us that Mark buying the blue shirt necessarily means Lisa bought the red shirt. \n\nAnswer: no",
