The first statement is a conditional statement, where the occurrence of the second event (Chris finishing the race) is dependent on the first event (Alex finishing the race). However, the occurrence of the first event (Alex finishing the race) is not necessarily dependent on the second event. The second statement tells us that Chris finished the race, but it does not provide any information about whether Alex finished the race. Therefore, from these two statements, we cannot logically infer that Alex finished the race. \n\nAnswer: no",
