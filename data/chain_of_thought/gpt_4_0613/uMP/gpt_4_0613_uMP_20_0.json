The statement also confirms that P is true, i.e., \"the apple was red\". According to the rules of logic, if a conditional statement is true and its first part (P) is also true, then its second part (Q) must also be true. Therefore, if \"the apple was red\" is true, then \"the banana was yellow\" must also be true. \n\nAnswer: yes",
