However, it does not tell us what happens if Kate eats salad. The fact that 'Kate ate salad' does not necessarily mean that 'Ben ate pasta'. It could be the case that Kate ate salad regardless of what Ben ate. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that 'Ben ate pasta' just because 'Kate ate salad'. \n\nAnswer: no",
