The first statement is a conditional statement, where the vampire being awake is a sufficient condition for the mummy being awake. However, the mummy being awake is not a necessary condition for the vampire being awake. In other words, the mummy could be awake whether the vampire is awake or not. The second statement tells us that the mummy was awake, but it does not provide any information about whether the vampire was awake. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the vampire was awake based on these statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
