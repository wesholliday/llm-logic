The first statement, \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal,\" does not imply that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic. It only states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. The second statement, \"The truck was metal,\" does not provide any information about the material of the doll. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the doll was plastic based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
