            "content": "The statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim' is a conditional statement. It means that whenever the shirt is cotton, the pants are denim. However, it does not mean that whenever the pants are denim, the shirt is cotton. The second statement 'The pants were denim' does not necessarily mean that the shirt was cotton. The shirt could be made of any material. The pants being denim does not guarantee that the shirt was cotton. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that 'The shirt was cotton' from these two statements. \n\nAnswer: no",
