The first statement is a conditional statement, where the presence of Mary at the wedding implies the presence of Sue. However, the presence of Sue at the wedding does not necessarily imply the presence of Mary. The second statement only confirms that Sue was at the wedding. It does not provide any information about Mary's presence. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that Mary was at the wedding based on these statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
