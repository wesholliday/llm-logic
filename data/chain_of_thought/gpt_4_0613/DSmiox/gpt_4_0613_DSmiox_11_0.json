If it's possible that the flug is not zimmed, and we know that it must be either blummed or zimmed, then it must be the case that the flug is blummed. This is because the only other option (that the flug is zimmed) has been ruled out as a possibility. Therefore, we can infer that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
