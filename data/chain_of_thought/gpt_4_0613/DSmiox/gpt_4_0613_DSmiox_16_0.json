If we combine these two statements, we can infer that if the sneg is not sproted, then it must be crampled. However, the first statement only tells us that the sneg might not be sproted, not that it definitely isn't. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the sneg is crampled. \n\nAnswer: no",
