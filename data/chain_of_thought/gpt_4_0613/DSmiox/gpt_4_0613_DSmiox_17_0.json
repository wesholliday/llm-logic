If we combine these two statements, we can infer that since the flob might not be movated, it must be the case that the flob is skizzled. This is because the second statement tells us that if the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled. Therefore, we can infer that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
