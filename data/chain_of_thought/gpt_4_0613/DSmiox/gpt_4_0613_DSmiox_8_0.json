If we combine these two statements, we can infer that if the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked. However, the first statement doesn't definitively say that the sprocket is not daggled, only that it might not be. Therefore, we can't definitively infer that the sprocket is cranked. \n\nAnswer: no",
