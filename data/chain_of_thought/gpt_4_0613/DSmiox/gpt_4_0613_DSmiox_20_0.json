If it's possible that the fleeg is not surned, and the only other option given is that the fleeg is bluttered, then we can infer that the fleeg must be bluttered. This is because the second statement presents us with only two possibilities, and the first statement rules out one of those possibilities. Therefore, the fleeg must be the remaining possibility, which is that it is bluttered. \n\nAnswer: yes",
