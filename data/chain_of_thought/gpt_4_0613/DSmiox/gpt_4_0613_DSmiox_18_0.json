If we combine these two statements, we can infer that if the shank is not nugged, then it must be plooked. Since the first statement allows for the possibility that the shank is not nugged, then it must be the case that the shank could be plooked. However, it's important to note that the first statement only says the shank might not be nugged, not that it definitely isn't. Therefore, we can't definitively infer that the shank is plooked. \n\nAnswer: no",
