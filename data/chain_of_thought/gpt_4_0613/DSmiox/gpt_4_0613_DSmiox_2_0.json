If we combine these two statements, we can infer that since the wug might not be bimmed, it must be flooped. This is because the second statement gives us only two options for the wug: it is either flooped or bimmed. If it's not bimmed, then it must be the other option, which is flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
