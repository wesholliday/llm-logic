If we combine these two statements, we can infer that since the grommet might not be plopped, then it must be the case that the grommet is sploffed. This is because the second statement tells us that if the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed. Therefore, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed. \n\nAnswer: yes",
