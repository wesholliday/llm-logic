The first statement is a conditional statement, where the robot visiting Jupiter is dependent on the alien visiting Mars. However, the second statement only tells us that the robot visited Jupiter. It does not provide any information about whether the alien visited Mars or not. The alien visiting Mars is not a necessary condition for the robot to visit Jupiter, according to the information given. Therefore, we cannot infer that the alien visited Mars just because the robot visited Jupiter. \n\nAnswer: No",
