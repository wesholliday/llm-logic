It could be that Sue chose pizza, or it could be that she chose something else. The fact that Bob chose pasta doesn't necessarily mean that Sue chose pizza. The statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" doesn't mean \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza\". Therefore, we cannot infer that Sue chose pizza just because Bob chose pasta.\n\nAnswer: No",
