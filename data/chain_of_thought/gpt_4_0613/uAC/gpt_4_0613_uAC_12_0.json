This means that Joe going to the park is a sufficient condition for Lucy going to the zoo, but not a necessary one. Lucy could go to the zoo for other reasons, not just because Joe went to the park. Therefore, even though we know that Lucy went to the zoo, we cannot infer that Joe went to the park. \n\nAnswer: no",
