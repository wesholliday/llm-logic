However, this does not necessarily mean that Mary was at the wedding. The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" does not imply the reverse, i.e., \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\". Therefore, we cannot infer that Mary was at the wedding based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
