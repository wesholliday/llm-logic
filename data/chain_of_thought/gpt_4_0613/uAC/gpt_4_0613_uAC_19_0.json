It doesn't mean that every time Jen watches basketball, Tom must have watched football. The second piece of information is: \"Jen watched basketball.\" This alone doesn't provide enough information to determine whether Tom watched football or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that Tom watched football just because Jen watched basketball. \n\nAnswer: no",
