This is a conditional statement where the first part (the doll being plastic) is the condition for the second part (the truck being metal). However, the fact that the truck is metal does not necessarily mean that the doll is plastic. The doll could be made of any material and the truck could still be metal. The statements do not provide a reverse condition that if the truck is metal, then the doll must be plastic. Therefore, we cannot infer that the doll was plastic just because the truck was metal. \n\nAnswer: no",
