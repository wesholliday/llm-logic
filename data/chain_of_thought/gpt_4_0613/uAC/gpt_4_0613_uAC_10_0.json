This means that while the dog being inside guarantees that the cat is outside, the cat being outside does not necessarily mean the dog was inside. The cat could be outside for a variety of reasons unrelated to the dog's location. Therefore, we cannot infer that the dog was inside just because the cat was outside. \n\nAnswer: no",
