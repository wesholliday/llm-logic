However, this does not necessarily mean that the cake was chocolate. The statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is a conditional statement, not a biconditional one. It does not mean that the only way for the muffins to be blueberry is if the cake is chocolate. The muffins could be blueberry even if the cake was not chocolate. Therefore, we cannot infer that the cake was chocolate just because the muffins were blueberry.\n\nAnswer: no",
