However, these statements do not provide a direct cause and effect relationship between the bear being in the cave and the wolf being in the den. The first statement is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (the bear being in the cave) is true, then the second part (the wolf being in the den) must also be true. But the reverse is not necessarily true. Just because the wolf is in the den, it doesn't mean that the bear is in the cave. The bear could be somewhere else. Therefore, we cannot infer that the bear was in the cave just because the wolf was in the den.\n\nAnswer: No",
