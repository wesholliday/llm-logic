This is a conditional statement, and it does not necessarily mean that if Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane. The statement does not provide a direct cause and effect relationship between Sam taking a plane and Erin taking a train. It only states the consequence (Erin taking a train) if a certain condition (Sam taking a plane) is met. Therefore, even though we know that Erin took a train, we cannot definitively infer that Sam took a plane. \n\nAnswer: No",
