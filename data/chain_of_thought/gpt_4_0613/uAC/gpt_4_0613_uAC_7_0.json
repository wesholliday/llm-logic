However, it does not allow us to infer the reverse: that if Chris finished the race, then Alex did as well. The statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" does not necessarily mean \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race\". Therefore, even though we know that Chris finished the race, we cannot infer that Alex finished the race based on the information given. \n\nAnswer: No",
