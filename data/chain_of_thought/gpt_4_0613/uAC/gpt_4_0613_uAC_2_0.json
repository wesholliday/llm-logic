This is a conditional statement where the presence of the griffin implies the presence of the unicorn. However, the presence of the unicorn does not necessarily imply the presence of the griffin. The unicorn could be in the forest without the griffin being there. Therefore, we cannot infer that the griffin was in the forest just because the unicorn was in the forest. \n\nAnswer: No",
