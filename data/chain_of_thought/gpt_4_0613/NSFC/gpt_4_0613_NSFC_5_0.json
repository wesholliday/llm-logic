            "content": "Explanation: The original statement, \"Sarah might study biology or chemistry,\" implies that Sarah has two options for study: biology and chemistry. However, the use of the word \"or\" suggests that these options are mutually exclusive, meaning she will choose one or the other, but not both. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"Sarah might study biology and Sarah might study chemistry\" because the original statement does not suggest that both options can occur simultaneously.\n\nAnswer: No",
