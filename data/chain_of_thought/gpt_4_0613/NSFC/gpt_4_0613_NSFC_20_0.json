            "content": "Explanation: The original statement says that the concert might feature rock or jazz music. This means that there are two possibilities for the type of music that might be featured at the concert: rock music or jazz music. Therefore, it is possible that the concert might feature rock music, and it is also possible that the concert might feature jazz music.
