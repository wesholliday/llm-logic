The proposed inference, \"The package might arrive on Monday and the package might arrive on Tuesday,\" could be interpreted as the package possibly arriving on both days, which is not what the original statement implies. However, if we interpret the inference as the package having the possibility to arrive on either Monday or Tuesday (not both), then it is consistent with the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
