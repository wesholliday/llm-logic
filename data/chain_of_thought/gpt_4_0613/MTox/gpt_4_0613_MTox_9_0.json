This is a conditional statement, where being plinked leads to being varnished. \n\nSince we know that the twonk was not varnished, and we know that being plinked would result in being varnished, we can infer that the twonk was not plinked. If it had been plinked, it would have been varnished, which contradicts the information we have. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
