If the wug was sproinged, according to the second statement, it would have to be garpled. But we know from the first statement that the wug was not garpled. Therefore, the wug could not have been sproinged, because if it was, it would contradict the information we have that the wug was not garpled. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
