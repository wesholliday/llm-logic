This is a conditional statement where 'the flug was blummed' is the condition and 'the flug was zimmed' is the result. \n\nIf the result (the flug was zimmed) is not true, then the condition (the flug was blummed) cannot be true either. This is because according to the conditional statement, if the condition were true, then the result would also have to be true. But we know from the first statement that the result is not true. Therefore, the condition cannot be true either.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
