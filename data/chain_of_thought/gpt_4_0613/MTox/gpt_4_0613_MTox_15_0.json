The second statement is a conditional statement that says 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened'. \n\nThe conditional statement can be interpreted as: if a certain condition (the dreb was vroombed) is true, then a certain result (the dreb was spened) will also be true. \n\nGiven that we know the dreb was not spened, and if it were true that the dreb was vroombed then it would have to be spened, we can infer that the condition (the dreb was vroombed) must not have been met. \n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The dreb was not vroombed'. \n\nAnswer: yes",
