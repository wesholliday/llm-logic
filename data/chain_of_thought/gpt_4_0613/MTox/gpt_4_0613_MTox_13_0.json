This is a conditional statement where 'the glip was slogged' is the condition and 'the glip was tragged' is the result. \n\nIf the result (the glip was tragged) is false, as stated in the first statement, then the condition (the glip was slogged) must also be false. This is because in a conditional statement, if the result is false, then the condition must also be false. \n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The glip was not slogged'. \n\nAnswer: yes",
