This is a conditional statement where the condition is 'the splat was morphed' and the result is 'the splat quanked'. \n\nGiven that we know 'the splat did not quank', we can infer that the condition for quanking did not occur. In other words, 'the splat was not morphed'. This is because if the splat had been morphed, according to the second statement, it would have quanked. But we know it did not quank, so it must not have been morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
