The second statement is a conditional statement, where the condition is 'the flob was skizzled' and the result is 'the flob movated'. \n\nAccording to the rules of logic, if the result of a conditional statement is false, then the condition must also be false. This is known as the contrapositive. In this case, we know that 'the flob did not movated', which means the result of the conditional statement is false. Therefore, we can infer that the condition 'the flob was skizzled' is also false, or in other words, 'the flob was not skizzled'. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
