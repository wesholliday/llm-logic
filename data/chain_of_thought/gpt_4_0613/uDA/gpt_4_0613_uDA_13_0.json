            "content": "The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement. It tells us that if a certain condition (the car being red) is met, then another condition (the truck being blue) will also be met. However, it does not tell us what happens if the first condition is not met. In other words, if the car is not red, the statement does not provide any information about the color of the truck. Therefore, we cannot infer that the truck was not blue just because the car was not red. The truck could be blue or it could be some other color; the statement does not provide enough information to determine this. \n\nAnswer: no",
