However, the second part of the information given is that Alex did not finish the race. This does not necessarily mean that Chris did not finish the race. Chris could have finished the race independently of Alex. The information given does not provide a direct correlation between Alex not finishing the race and Chris not finishing the race. Therefore, we cannot infer that Chris did not finish the race based solely on the information that Alex did not finish the race. \n\nAnswer: No",
