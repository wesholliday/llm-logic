However, the absence of the bear in the cave does not guarantee the absence of the wolf in the den. The wolf could be in the den for other reasons not related to the bear's location. Therefore, we cannot infer that the wolf was not in the den just because the bear was not in the cave. \n\nAnswer: No",
