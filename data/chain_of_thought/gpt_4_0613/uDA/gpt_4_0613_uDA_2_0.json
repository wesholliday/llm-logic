It tells us what would be true if the griffin was in the forest. However, we are also told that the griffin was not in the forest. This means that the condition for the unicorn being in the forest is not met. However, this does not necessarily mean that the unicorn was not in the forest. The unicorn could be in the forest for other reasons not mentioned in the statements. Therefore, we cannot infer that the unicorn was not in the forest based on the given information. \n\nAnswer: No",
