It tells us what happens if Sue chooses pizza, but it doesn't tell us what happens if Sue doesn't choose pizza. Therefore, we can't infer anything about Bob's choice based on the information that Sue did not choose pizza. Bob could have chosen pasta or he could have chosen something else. We simply don't have enough information to make a definitive statement about Bob's choice. \n\nAnswer: No",
