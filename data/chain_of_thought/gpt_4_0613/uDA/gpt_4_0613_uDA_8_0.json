It tells us what happens if the vampire is awake, but it doesn't tell us what happens if the vampire is not awake. The second statement tells us that the vampire was not awake. However, these two statements together do not provide any information about whether the mummy was awake or not when the vampire was not awake. Therefore, we cannot infer that the mummy was not awake.",
