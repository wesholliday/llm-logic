However, it does not provide any information about the genre of books not written by James. The book not being written by James does not necessarily mean it is not a mystery novel. It could still be a mystery novel written by another author. Therefore, we cannot infer that the book is not a mystery novel just because it was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: No",
