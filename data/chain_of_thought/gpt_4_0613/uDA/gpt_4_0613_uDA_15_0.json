However, it does not tell us what happens if Sam does not take a plane. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about Erin's mode of transportation from the information that Sam did not take a plane. Erin could have taken a train or not, we simply don't have enough information to say for sure. \n\nAnswer: No",
