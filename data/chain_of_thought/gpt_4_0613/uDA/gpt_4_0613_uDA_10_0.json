However, the second statement tells us that the dog was not inside. This means that the condition for the cat being outside is not met. However, this does not necessarily mean that the cat was not outside. The cat could be outside for other reasons not mentioned in the statements. Therefore, we cannot infer that the cat was not outside based on the information given. \n\nAnswer: No",
