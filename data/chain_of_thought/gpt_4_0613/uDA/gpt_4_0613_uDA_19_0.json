            "content": "The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is a conditional statement. It tells us what happens if Tom watches football, but it doesn't tell us what happens if Tom doesn't watch football. Therefore, we can't infer anything about whether Jen watched basketball or not based on the information that Tom did not watch football. The statement doesn't tell us that Jen only watches basketball when Tom watches football, just that she definitely does when he does. So, Jen could have watched basketball even if Tom did not watch football. \n\nAnswer: No",
