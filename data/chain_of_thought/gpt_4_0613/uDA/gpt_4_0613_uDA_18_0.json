It tells us what is true if the doll is plastic, but it doesn't tell us anything about what is true if the doll is not plastic. The second statement tells us that the doll was not plastic. However, these two statements together do not provide any information about whether the truck was metal or not. The truck could be metal or not metal regardless of the material of the doll. Therefore, we cannot infer that the truck was not metal based on these statements. \n\nAnswer: no",
