However, it does not tell us anything about what is true if the cake was not chocolate. Therefore, even though we know the cake was not chocolate, we cannot infer anything about the muffins from this statement. They could be blueberry or they could be some other flavor. The information given does not allow us to make a definitive conclusion about the muffins. \n\nAnswer: No",
