It tells us what happens if Ben eats pasta, but it doesn't tell us what happens if Ben doesn't eat pasta. Therefore, we can't infer anything about whether or not Kate ate salad based on the information that Ben did not eat pasta. Kate could have eaten salad or she could have not eaten salad; we simply don't have enough information to make a determination. \n\nAnswer: No",
