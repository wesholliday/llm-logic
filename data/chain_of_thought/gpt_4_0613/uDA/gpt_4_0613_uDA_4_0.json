In this case, the alien visiting Mars is the condition for the robot visiting Jupiter. However, the statement does not specify what happens if the alien does not visit Mars. It does not necessarily mean that the robot did not visit Jupiter. The robot could have visited Jupiter under different conditions or even without any conditions. Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer that the robot did not visit Jupiter just because the alien did not visit Mars. \n\nAnswer: No",
