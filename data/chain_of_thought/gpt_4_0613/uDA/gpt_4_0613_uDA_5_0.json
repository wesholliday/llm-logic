            "content": "The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is a conditional statement. It tells us what happens if a certain condition (Jeff playing basketball) is met. However, it does not tell us what happens if that condition is not met. In other words, it does not tell us whether or not Amy played tennis if Jeff did not play basketball. Therefore, we cannot infer that Amy did not play tennis just because Jeff did not play basketball. Amy could have played tennis for other reasons, or she could have not played at all. We simply do not have enough information to make that inference. \n\nAnswer: No",
