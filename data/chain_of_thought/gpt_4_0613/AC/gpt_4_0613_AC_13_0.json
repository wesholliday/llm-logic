            "content": "The statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' is a conditional statement. It tells us that whenever the car is red, the truck is blue. However, it does not tell us that the only way the truck can be blue is if the car is red. The truck could be blue for other reasons. Therefore, knowing that 'The truck was blue' does not necessarily mean 'The car was red'. This is a common logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. \n\nAnswer: No",
