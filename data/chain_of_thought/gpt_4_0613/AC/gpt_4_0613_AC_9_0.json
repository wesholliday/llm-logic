However, it does not tell us what happens if Mark bought the blue shirt. The statement 'Mark bought the blue shirt' does not necessarily mean that Lisa bought the red shirt. The original conditional statement does not work in reverse. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'Lisa bought the red shirt' from these two statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
