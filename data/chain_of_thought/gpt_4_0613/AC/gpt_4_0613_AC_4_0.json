It tells us that if a certain condition is met (the alien visiting Mars), then a certain outcome will occur (the robot visiting Jupiter). However, it does not tell us that the only way for the robot to visit Jupiter is if the alien visits Mars. \n\nThe second statement 'The robot visited Jupiter' tells us that the outcome has occurred. However, it does not tell us what caused this outcome. It could have been the alien visiting Mars, or it could have been something else entirely. \n\nTherefore, from these two statements, we cannot infer that 'The alien visited Mars'. \n\nAnswer: no",
