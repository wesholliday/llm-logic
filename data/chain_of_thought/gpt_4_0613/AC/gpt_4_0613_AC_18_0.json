            "content": "The statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' is a conditional statement. It tells us that if a certain condition (the doll being plastic) is true, then another condition (the truck being metal) is also true. However, it does not tell us that the reverse is true. In other words, it does not tell us that if the truck is metal, then the doll must be plastic. The truck could be metal for a variety of reasons that have nothing to do with the material of the doll. Therefore, from the statement 'The truck was metal', we cannot infer 'The doll was plastic'. \n\nAnswer: No",
