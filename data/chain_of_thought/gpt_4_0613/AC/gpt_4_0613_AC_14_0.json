It tells us that if a certain condition is met (the bear being in the cave), then a certain outcome will occur (the wolf being in the den). However, it does not tell us that the only way for the wolf to be in the den is if the bear is in the cave. Therefore, knowing that 'The wolf was in the den' does not necessarily mean 'The bear was in the cave'. The wolf could be in the den for other reasons not mentioned in the statement. \n\nAnswer: No",
