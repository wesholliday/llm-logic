            "content": "The statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' is a conditional statement. It tells us that if a certain condition (the apple being red) is true, then another condition (the banana being yellow) is also true. However, it does not tell us that if the second condition (the banana being yellow) is true, then the first condition (the apple being red) must also be true. This is a common logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. Therefore, from the statement 'The banana was yellow', we cannot infer 'The apple was red'. \n\nAnswer: no",
