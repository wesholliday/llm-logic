In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement does not necessarily hold true based on the truth of the original statement. \n\nThe original statement is: If the alien visited Mars (P), then the robot visited Jupiter (Q). This can be written as: P implies Q.\n\nThe inverse statement is: If the alien did not visit Mars (not P), then the robot did not visit Jupiter (not Q). This can be written as: not P implies not Q.\n\nThe truth of the original statement (P implies Q) does not guarantee the truth of the inverse (not P implies not Q). For example, it could be the case that even if the alien did not visit Mars, the robot still visited Jupiter for some other reason. \n\nTherefore, the form of argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
