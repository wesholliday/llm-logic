In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement does not necessarily hold true based on the truth of the original statement. \n\nThe original statement is: If Lisa bought the red shirt (P), then Mark bought the blue shirt (Q). This can be represented as P -> Q.\n\nThe inverse statement is: If Lisa did not buy the red shirt (~P), then Mark did not buy the blue shirt (~Q). This can be represented as ~P -> ~Q.\n\nThe truth of P -> Q does not guarantee the truth of ~P -> ~Q. For example, it could be the case that even if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, Mark still bought the blue shirt for some other reason. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
