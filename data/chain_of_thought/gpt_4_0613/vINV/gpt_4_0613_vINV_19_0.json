The premise 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' does not provide any information about what happens when Tom does not watch football. It is possible that Jen could watch basketball even if Tom did not watch football. Therefore, the conclusion 'If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball' does not logically follow from the given premise. \n\nAnswer: No",
