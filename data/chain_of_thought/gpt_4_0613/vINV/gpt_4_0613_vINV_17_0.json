In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement does not necessarily hold true just because the original statement is true. \n\nThe original statement is: If Ben ate pasta (P), then Kate ate salad (Q). This can be represented as P -> Q.\n\nThe inverse statement is: If Ben did not eat pasta (~P), then Kate did not eat salad (~Q). This can be represented as ~P -> ~Q.\n\nThe truth of P -> Q does not guarantee the truth of ~P -> ~Q. For example, it could be the case that even if Ben did not eat pasta, Kate still ate salad for some other reason. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
