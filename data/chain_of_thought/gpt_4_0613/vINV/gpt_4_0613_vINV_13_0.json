In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement does not necessarily hold true based on the truth of the original statement. \n\nThe original statement is: If the car was red (P), then the truck was blue (Q). The inverse is: If the car was not red (~P), then the truck was not blue (~Q). \n\nThe truth of the original statement (If P, then Q) does not guarantee the truth of its inverse (If ~P, then ~Q). For example, it could be the case that even if the car was not red, the truck could still be blue for some other reason. \n\nTherefore, the form of argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
