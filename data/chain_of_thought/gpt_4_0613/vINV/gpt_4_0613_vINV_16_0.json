The inverse is 'If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim'. \n\nIn logic, the inverse of a statement does not necessarily hold true based on the truth of the original statement. Just because the shirt being cotton implies the pants are denim, it does not mean that if the shirt is not cotton, the pants are not denim. The pants could be denim regardless of the material of the shirt. \n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
