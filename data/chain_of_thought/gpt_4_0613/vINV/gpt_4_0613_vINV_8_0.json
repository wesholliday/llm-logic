Just because 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is true, it does not necessarily mean that 'If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake' is also true. The mummy could have been awake independently of the vampire's state of consciousness. Therefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
