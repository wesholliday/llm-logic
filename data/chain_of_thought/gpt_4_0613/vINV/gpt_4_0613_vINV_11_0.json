Just because 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' is true, it does not automatically mean that 'If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry' is also true. The muffins could be blueberry regardless of the type of cake. Therefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
