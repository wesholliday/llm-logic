The premise 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis' does not provide any information about what happens when Jeff does not play basketball. It is possible that Amy could still play tennis even if Jeff did not play basketball. Therefore, the conclusion 'If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis' does not logically follow from the given premise. \n\nAnswer: No",
