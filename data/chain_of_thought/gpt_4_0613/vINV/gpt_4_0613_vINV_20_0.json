            "content": "The form of argument presented here is known as the inverse of the original statement. The original statement is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'. The inverse is 'If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow'. \n\nIn logic, the inverse of a statement does not necessarily hold true just because the original statement is true. For example, consider the statement 'If it is raining, then the ground is wet'. The inverse would be 'If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet'. However, the ground could still be wet for other reasons, such as someone watering the lawn or a broken water pipe. \n\nSimilarly, in the case of the apple and banana, just because a red apple implies a yellow banana, it does not mean that a non-red apple implies a non-yellow banana. The banana could be yellow for other reasons, such as it being ripe. \n\nTherefore, the form of argument presented is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
