The inverse is 'If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den'. \n\nIn logic, the inverse of a statement does not necessarily hold true based on the truth of the original statement. Just because the bear being in the cave implies the wolf is in the den, it does not mean that if the bear is not in the cave, the wolf is not in the den. The wolf could be in the den for other reasons unrelated to the bear's location. Therefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
