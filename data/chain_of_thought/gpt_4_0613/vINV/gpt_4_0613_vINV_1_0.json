            "content": "The form of argument presented here is known as the inverse of the original statement. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement does not necessarily hold true based on the truth of the original statement. \n\nThe original statement is: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This means that Mary's presence guarantees Sue's presence. However, it does not provide any information about what happens when Mary is not present. \n\nThe inverse statement is: If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding. This statement assumes that Mary's absence guarantees Sue's absence. But based on the original statement, we cannot make this assumption. Sue could still be at the wedding even if Mary is not. \n\nTherefore, the form of argument is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No",
