This means that the grazzle has to be one of two things: either a crunk zump or a grooble. Therefore, it is not necessarily true that the grazzle must be a crunk zump, because it could also be a grooble. The statement \"The grazzle must be crunk zump\" would only be true if the original statement did not include the possibility of the grazzle being a grooble.\n\nAnswer: no",
