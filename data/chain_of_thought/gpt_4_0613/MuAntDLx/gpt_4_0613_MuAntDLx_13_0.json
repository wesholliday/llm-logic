It could be in plimp, or it could be in flim, or it could be in both. However, the statement does not guarantee that the fribble must be in plimp. It only guarantees that the fribble is in at least one of the two options. Therefore, we cannot infer from this statement that \"The fribble must be in plimp\".\n\nAnswer: no",
