This means that there are two possible locations for the floob: it could be in the glorp, or it could be on the wibble. The statement does not guarantee that the floob is in the glorp, because it could also be on the wibble. Therefore, we cannot infer from this statement that the floob must be in the glorp.\n\nAnswer: no",
