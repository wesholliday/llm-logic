It means that Joe going to the park is a sufficient condition for Lucy going to the zoo. However, it does not mean that Joe going to the park is a necessary condition for Lucy going to the zoo. Lucy could go to the zoo for other reasons, not just because Joe went to the park. Therefore, even if 'Lucy went to the zoo' is true, it does not necessarily mean that 'Joe went to the park' is true. \n\nAnswer: No",
