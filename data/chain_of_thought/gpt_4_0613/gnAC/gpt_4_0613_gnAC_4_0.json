In this type of statement, the truth of the second part (the robot visited Jupiter) does not necessarily imply the truth of the first part (the alien visited Mars). The statement only guarantees that if the first part is true, then the second part is also true. It does not work in reverse. Therefore, even though 'The robot visited Jupiter' is true, we cannot definitively say that 'The alien visited Mars' is also true based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: No",
