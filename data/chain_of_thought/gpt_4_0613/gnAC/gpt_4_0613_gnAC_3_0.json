The book is a mystery novel.\n\nFrom these statements, we know that all books written by James are mystery novels and that the book in question is a mystery novel. However, this does not necessarily mean that the book was written by James. There could be other authors who write mystery novels as well. The first statement does not imply that only James writes mystery novels. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the book was written by James just because it is a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: No",
