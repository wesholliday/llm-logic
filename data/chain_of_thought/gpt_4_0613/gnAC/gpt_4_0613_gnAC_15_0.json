It means that if the first part (Sam taking a plane) is true, then the second part (Erin taking a train) must also be true. However, it does not mean that if the second part is true, then the first part must also be true. In other words, just because Erin took a train, it does not necessarily mean that Sam took a plane. Sam could have taken a plane, or he could have taken some other form of transportation. The statement does not provide enough information to determine whether or not Sam took a plane. \n\nAnswer: no",
