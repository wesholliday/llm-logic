The first statement is a conditional statement, where the occurrence of Jen watching basketball is dependent on Tom watching football. However, the second statement, 'Jen watched basketball', does not provide any information about whether Tom watched football or not. It could be possible that Jen watched basketball for some other reason, not necessarily because Tom watched football. Therefore, from these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that 'Tom watched football' is true. \n\nAnswer: no",
