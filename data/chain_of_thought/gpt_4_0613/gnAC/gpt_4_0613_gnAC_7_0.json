It means that Alex finishing the race is a sufficient condition for Chris finishing the race. However, it does not mean that Alex finishing the race is a necessary condition for Chris finishing the race. In other words, Chris could finish the race without Alex finishing the race. Therefore, even if we know that 'Chris finished the race' is true, we cannot necessarily conclude that 'Alex finished the race' is true. \n\nAnswer: no",
