The first statement is a conditional statement, where the car being red is a sufficient condition for the truck being blue. However, it does not mean that the truck being blue is a necessary condition for the car being red. In other words, the truck can be blue without the car being red. The second statement confirms that the truck is indeed blue, but it does not provide any information about the color of the car. Therefore, from these two statements, we cannot necessarily conclude that the car was red. \n\nAnswer: no",
