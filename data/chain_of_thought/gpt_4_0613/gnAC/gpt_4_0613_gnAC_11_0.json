The first statement is a conditional statement, where the presence of a chocolate cake implies the presence of blueberry muffins. However, the reverse is not necessarily true. The presence of blueberry muffins does not imply that the cake was chocolate. The muffins could be blueberry for any number of reasons unrelated to the flavor of the cake. Therefore, even though the second statement 'The muffins were blueberry' is true, it does not necessarily mean that 'The cake was chocolate' is also true.\n\nAnswer: No",
