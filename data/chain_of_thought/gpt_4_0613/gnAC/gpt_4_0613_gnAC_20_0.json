The first statement is a conditional statement, where the condition is 'the apple was red' and the result is 'the banana was yellow'. The second statement confirms the result of the first statement, but it does not confirm the condition. In other words, just because the banana was yellow, it does not necessarily mean that the apple was red. There could be other reasons why the banana was yellow. Therefore, it does not necessarily follow that 'The apple was red' is true. \n\nAnswer: no",
