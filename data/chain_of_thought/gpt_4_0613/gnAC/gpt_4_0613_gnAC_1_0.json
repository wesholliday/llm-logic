However, it does not mean that Sue's presence at the wedding guarantees Mary's presence. Sue could be at the wedding whether or not Mary is there. Therefore, even though we know that 'Sue was at the wedding' is true, we cannot definitively say that 'Mary was at the wedding' is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
