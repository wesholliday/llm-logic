The first statement is a conditional statement, where the doll being plastic is a sufficient condition for the truck being metal. However, it does not mean that the truck being metal is a sufficient condition for the doll being plastic. The truck could be metal for other reasons not related to the doll's material. Therefore, even though the second statement 'The truck was metal' is true, it does not necessarily mean that 'The doll was plastic' is true. \n\nAnswer: No",
