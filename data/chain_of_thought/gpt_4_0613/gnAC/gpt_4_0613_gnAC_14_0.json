In this case, the statement is \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" The bear being in the cave is the condition that, if met, guarantees that the wolf is in the den. However, the reverse is not necessarily true. Just because the wolf is in the den, it does not guarantee that the bear is in the cave. The wolf could be in the den for any number of reasons that have nothing to do with the bear's location. Therefore, even though the statement \"The wolf was in the den\" is true, it does not necessarily follow that \"The bear was in the cave\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: No",
