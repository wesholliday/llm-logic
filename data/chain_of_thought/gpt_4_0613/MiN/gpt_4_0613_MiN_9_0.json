            "content": "The statement 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt' implies that there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This means that it is not certain or necessary that Lisa bought the red shirt. Therefore, it is correct to infer that 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt'. This is because the word 'must' implies a necessity or certainty, which is not present in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
