This means that it is not certain whether Jeff played basketball or not. \n\nOn the other hand, the statement 'It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball' implies that it is not necessary that Jeff played basketball. This means that there is a possibility that Jeff did not play basketball. \n\nTherefore, if it is possible that Jeff did not play basketball (as suggested by the first statement), then it is not necessary that Jeff played basketball (as suggested by the second statement). \n\nSo, from 'Jeff might not have played basketball', we can infer 'It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball'. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
