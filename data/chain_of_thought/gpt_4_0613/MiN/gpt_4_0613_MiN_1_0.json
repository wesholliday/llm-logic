This means that her presence at the wedding is not certain or guaranteed. \n\nOn the other hand, the statement 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding' implies that there is no necessity or obligation for Mary to have been at the wedding. This also means that her presence at the wedding is not certain or guaranteed. \n\nTherefore, if it is possible that Mary was not at the wedding, it follows that it is not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
