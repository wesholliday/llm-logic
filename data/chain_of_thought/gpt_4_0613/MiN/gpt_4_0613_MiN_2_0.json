This means that it is not certain or necessary that the griffin was in the forest. Therefore, it is correct to infer 'It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest' from the original statement. This is because the word 'must' implies necessity or certainty, which is not present in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
