This directly contradicts the assertion 'The dog must have been inside', which implies certainty about the dog's location. If there is a possibility that the dog was not inside, then it cannot be the case that the dog must have been inside. Therefore, from 'The dog might not have been inside', we can infer 'It's not the case that the dog must have been inside'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
