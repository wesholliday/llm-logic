It tells us that if a certain condition (the dog being inside) is true, then another condition (the cat being outside) is also true. \n\nThe second statement 'The cat was not outside' tells us that the second condition of the first statement is not true. \n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement 'If P then Q' and we know that Q is false, we can infer that P is also false. This is known as modus tollens. \n\nIn this case, P is 'The dog was inside' and Q is 'The cat was outside'. Since we know that Q is false (the cat was not outside), we can infer that P is also false (the dog was not inside). \n\nAnswer: No",
