In this case, P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel\". The second statement tells us that Q is false, or \"not Q\". According to the rules of logic, if \"If P, then Q\" is true and \"not Q\" is also true, then we can infer \"not P\". Therefore, if the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
