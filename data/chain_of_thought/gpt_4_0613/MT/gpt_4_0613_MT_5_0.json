In other words, if Jeff played basketball, Amy definitely played tennis. \n\nThe second statement 'Amy did not play tennis' contradicts the condition that would have been fulfilled if Jeff had played basketball. \n\nTherefore, given that Amy did not play tennis, it can be inferred that Jeff did not play basketball. If he had, Amy would have played tennis, which we know she did not. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
