            "content": "The statement 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta' is a conditional statement. In logic, if we have a conditional statement of the form 'If P then Q', and we know that Q is false, then we can infer that P is also false. This is known as the principle of contraposition. In this case, P is 'Sue chose pizza' and Q is 'Bob chose pasta'. We know that 'Bob did not choose pasta', which means Q is false. Therefore, we can infer that 'Sue did not choose pizza', or P is also false. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
