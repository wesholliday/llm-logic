            "content": "The statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement. In this case, Lisa buying the red shirt is the condition that leads to Mark buying the blue shirt. If we know that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then we can infer that the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) did not occur. This is because if the condition had occurred (if Lisa had bought the red shirt), then the result (Mark buying the blue shirt) would have also occurred, according to the initial statement. Since we know the result did not occur, we can infer that the condition also did not occur. Therefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. \n\nAnswer: yes",
