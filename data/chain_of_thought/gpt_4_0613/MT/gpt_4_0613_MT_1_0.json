The second statement tells us that Sue was not at the wedding. If we assume that Mary was at the wedding, then according to the first statement, Sue must also have been at the wedding. But this contradicts the second statement, which tells us that Sue was not at the wedding. Therefore, our assumption that Mary was at the wedding must be false. So, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
