In this statement, the presence of the griffin in the forest implies the presence of the unicorn in the forest. However, the statement does not specify what happens if the unicorn is not in the forest. It does not necessarily mean that the griffin was not in the forest. The griffin could still be in the forest even if the unicorn was not. Therefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer that 'The griffin was not in the forest'.\n\nAnswer: no",
