            "content": "The statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' is a conditional statement. In logic, if we have a conditional statement 'if P then Q', and we know that 'Q' is false, then we can infer that 'P' is also false. This is known as modus tollens. In this case, 'P' is 'the apple was red' and 'Q' is 'the banana was yellow'. We know that 'Q' is false because 'The banana was not yellow'. Therefore, we can infer that 'P' is also false, i.e., 'The apple was not red'. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
