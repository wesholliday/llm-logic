In this case, the doll being plastic is the condition for the truck being metal. \n\nThe second statement 'The truck was not metal' contradicts the result of the condition in the first statement. \n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that the condition (the doll being plastic) is false. It could be that the condition was true, but the result did not follow. \n\nIn other words, it could be that the doll was plastic, but the truck was not metal, despite the first statement. \n\nTherefore, from these two statements, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic.",
