In this statement, the vampire being awake is a sufficient condition for the mummy being awake. This means that if the vampire is awake, the mummy must also be awake. \n\nThe second statement 'The mummy was not awake' contradicts the consequent of the first statement. If the mummy was not awake, then according to the first statement, the vampire could not have been awake. This is because if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would also have to be awake, which contradicts the second statement. \n\nTherefore, we can infer that the vampire was not awake. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
