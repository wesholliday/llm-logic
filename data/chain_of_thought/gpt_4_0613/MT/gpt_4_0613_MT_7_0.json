In other words, if Alex finishes, Chris definitely finishes. However, it does not imply that if Chris does not finish, then Alex does not finish. \n\nThe second statement 'Chris did not finish the race' tells us that Chris did not finish the race. \n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race. This is because if Alex had finished the race, then according to the first statement, Chris would have also finished the race. But we know from the second statement that Chris did not finish the race. Therefore, Alex could not have finished the race. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
