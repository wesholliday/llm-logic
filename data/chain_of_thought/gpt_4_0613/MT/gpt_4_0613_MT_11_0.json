In this case, the cake being chocolate is the condition for the muffins being blueberry. \n\nThe second statement 'The muffins were not blueberry' contradicts the result of the condition in the first statement. \n\nIf we assume that the first statement is true, then the only way for the muffins to not be blueberry is if the condition (the cake being chocolate) did not occur. \n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The cake was not chocolate'. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
