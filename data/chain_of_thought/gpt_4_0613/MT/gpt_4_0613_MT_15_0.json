In other words, if Sam took a plane, we can be sure that Erin took a train. However, it does not tell us what happens if Erin did not take a train.\n\nThe second statement 'Erin did not take a train' tells us that the condition 'Erin took a train' is not met. \n\nSince the first statement told us that 'Sam taking a plane' leads to 'Erin taking a train', and we know from the second statement that 'Erin did not take a train', we can infer that 'Sam did not take a plane'. If he had, Erin would have taken a train, which contradicts the information we have.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
