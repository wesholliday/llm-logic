            "content": "The statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' implies that Tom watching football is a sufficient condition for Jen watching basketball. In other words, if Tom watched football, it is guaranteed that Jen watched basketball. \n\nThe second statement 'Jen did not watch basketball' contradicts the condition that would have been fulfilled if Tom had watched football. \n\nTherefore, if Jen did not watch basketball, it means that the condition for Tom watching football was not met. This implies that Tom did not watch football. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
