            "content": "The statement 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den' is a conditional statement. In logic, if we have a conditional statement 'if P then Q', and we know that Q is false, we can infer that P is also false. This is known as modus tollens. In this case, P is 'the bear was in the cave' and Q is 'the wolf was in the den'. We know that 'the wolf was not in the den', which means Q is false. Therefore, we can infer that 'the bear was not in the cave', or P is false. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
