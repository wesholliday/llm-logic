            "content": "The statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' is a conditional statement. In this case, the car being red is the condition that leads to the truck being blue. \n\nThe second statement 'The truck was not blue' contradicts the result of the first statement. \n\nIn logic, if we have a statement of the form 'If P then Q', and we know that 'Not Q' is true, then we can infer 'Not P'. This is known as Modus Tollens in logic. \n\nSo, applying this to our case, if we know that 'If the car was red (P), then the truck was blue (Q)', and we know that 'The truck was not blue (Not Q)', then we can infer 'The car was not red (Not P)'. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
