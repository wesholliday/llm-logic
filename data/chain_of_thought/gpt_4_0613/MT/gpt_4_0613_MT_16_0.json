            "content": "The statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim' is a conditional statement. In logic, if we have a conditional statement 'if P then Q', and we know that Q is false, we can infer that P is also false. This is known as modus tollens. In this case, P is 'the shirt was cotton' and Q is 'the pants were denim'. We know that 'the pants were not denim' is true, so Q is false. Therefore, we can infer that 'the shirt was not cotton' is also true. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
