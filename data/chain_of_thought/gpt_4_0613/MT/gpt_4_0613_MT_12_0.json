In other words, if Joe goes to the park, Lucy will definitely go to the zoo. \n\nThe second statement 'Lucy did not go to the zoo' contradicts the consequence of the first statement. If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then it must be the case that the condition that would have caused her to go to the zoo (Joe going to the park) did not occur. \n\nTherefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
