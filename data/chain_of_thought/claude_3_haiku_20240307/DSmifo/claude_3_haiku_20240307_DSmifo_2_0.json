The first statement is \"The book might not be resting on the table.\" This means that it is possible that the book is not on the table.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf.\" This means that the book must be either on the table or on the shelf, and it cannot be anywhere else.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the two possibilities:\n   a) If the book is not on the table (as stated in the first statement), then it must be on the shelf (as stated in the second statement).\n   b) If the book is on the table, then it cannot be on the shelf (as stated in the second statement).\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes"
