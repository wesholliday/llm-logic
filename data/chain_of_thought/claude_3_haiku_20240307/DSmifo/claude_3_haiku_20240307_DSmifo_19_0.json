We are given the following two premises:\n   - \"The watch might not be on his wrist\"\n   - \"Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser\"\n\n2. The second premise is a logical statement in the form of an \"either-or\" statement. It states that the watch must be in one of two possible locations: on the wrist or charging on the dresser.\n\n3. The first premise, \"The watch might not be on his wrist,\" suggests that the watch is not on the wrist.\n\n4. If the watch is not on the wrist, and the only other possible location is that it is charging on the dresser, then we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes"
