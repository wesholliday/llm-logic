We are given the following two premises:\n   - \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\"\n   - \"Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer\"\n\n2. The first premise tells us that it is possible that the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand.\n\n3. The second premise gives us two possibilities: either the notebook is sitting on the nightstand, or it is in the drawer.\n\n4. Since the first premise tells us that the notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand, the only remaining possibility from the second premise is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
