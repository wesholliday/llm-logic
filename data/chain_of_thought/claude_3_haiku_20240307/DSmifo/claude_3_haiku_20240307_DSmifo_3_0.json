We are given the following two premises:\n   - \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\"\n   - \"Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer\"\n\n2. The first premise tells us that it is possible that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet.\n\n3. The second premise gives us two possibilities: either the keys are dangling in the cabinet, or they are in the drawer.\n\n4. Since the first premise tells us that the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet, the only remaining possibility is that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
