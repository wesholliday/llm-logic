The first statement is 'The cat might not be playing in the bedroom'. This means that the cat may or may not be playing in the bedroom.\n\n2. The second statement is 'Either the cat is playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch'. This means that the cat is either playing in the bedroom or napping on the couch, but not both.\n\n3. From the first statement, we know that the cat might not be playing in the bedroom. This means that the cat is either napping on the couch or doing something else (not playing in the bedroom).\n\n4. The second statement tells us that the cat is either playing in the bedroom or napping on the couch. Since we know from the first statement that the cat might not be playing in the bedroom, the only remaining possibility is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The cat is napping on the couch'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
