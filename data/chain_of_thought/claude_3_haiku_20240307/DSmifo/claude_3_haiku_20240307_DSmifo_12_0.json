The first premise is: \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\"\n   This means that it is possible that the jacket is not hanging in the closet.\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair.\"\n   This means that the jacket must be either hanging in the closet or draped over the chair. There are no other possibilities.\n\n3. Now, we need to consider the two possibilities:\n   a) If the jacket is not hanging in the closet (from the first premise), then it must be draped over the chair (from the second premise).\n   b) If the jacket is hanging in the closet, then it cannot be draped over the chair (from the second premise).\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes"
