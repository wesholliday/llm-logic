If the newspaper is not sitting on the porch (from the first statement), then the only remaining possibility is that it is in the driveway (from the second statement).\n2. Therefore, we can infer that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The newspaper might not be sitting on the porch.\n2. Either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway.\n3. Since the newspaper is not sitting on the porch (from step 1), it must be in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes"
