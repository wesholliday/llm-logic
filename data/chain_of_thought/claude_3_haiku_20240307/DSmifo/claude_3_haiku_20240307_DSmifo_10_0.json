We are given the following two premises:\n   - \"The missing sock might not be under the bed\"\n   - \"Either the missing sock must be under the bed or it's in the laundry basket\"\n\n2. The first premise tells us that the missing sock might not be under the bed. This means that it's possible the missing sock is not under the bed.\n\n3. The second premise tells us that the missing sock must either be under the bed or in the laundry basket. This means that the missing sock can only be in one of those two places.\n\n4. Combining the two premises, we can conclude that if the missing sock is not under the bed, then it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes"
