The first statement, \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry,\" suggests that it is possible that the cookies are not in the pantry.\n2. The second statement, \"Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar,\" provides the only two possible locations for the cookies: either in the pantry or in the jar.\n3. Since the first statement indicates that the cookies might not be in the pantry, the only remaining possibility is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
