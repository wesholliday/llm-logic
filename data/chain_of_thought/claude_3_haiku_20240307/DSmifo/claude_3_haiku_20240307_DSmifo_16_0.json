This means that the pen may or may not be on the desk.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag\". This means that the pen is either on the desk or in the bag, but not both.\n\n3. Now, if the pen is not on the desk (as stated in the first statement), then the only other possibility is that the pen is in the bag.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The pen is in my bag\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
