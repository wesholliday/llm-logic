This means that the shoes must be in one of the two states: either they are lined up by the door, or they are in the closet.\n\nThe first statement tells us that the shoes \"might not\" be lined up by the door. This implies that it is possible that the shoes are not lined up by the door.\n\nIf the shoes are not lined up by the door, and they must be either lined up by the door or in the closet (according to the second statement), then the only remaining possibility is that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes"
