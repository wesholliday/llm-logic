We are also given the statement: \"Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack.\"\n3. The second statement is a logical disjunction, which means that either one of the two possibilities is true, or both are true.\n4. Since the first statement says that the scarf \"might not be draped on the coat rack,\" this implies that the scarf is not draped on the coat rack.\n5. Therefore, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes"
