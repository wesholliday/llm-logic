We also have the premise: \"Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar.\"\n3. From the second premise, we can see that there are two possible locations for the cookies: either in the pantry or in the jar.\n4. The first premise tells us that the cookies \"might not be hidden in the pantry.\" This means that it is possible that the cookies are not in the pantry.\n5. If the cookies are not in the pantry, then the only other possible location for them is the jar, according to the second premise.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes"
