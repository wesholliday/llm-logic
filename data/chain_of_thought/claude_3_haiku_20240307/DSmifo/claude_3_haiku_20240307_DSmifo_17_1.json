The second premise is 'Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack'. This is a disjunction (either-or) statement, which means that the scarf must be in one of the two locations: either on the coat rack or in the backpack.\n\n3. Now, we need to consider the two possibilities:\n   - If the scarf is not draped on the coat rack (as stated in the first premise), then it must be stuffed in the backpack, based on the second premise.\n   - If the scarf is draped on the coat rack, then it cannot be stuffed in the backpack, based on the second premise.\n\n4.

The second statement is in the form of a logical disjunction, which means that either the scarf is draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in the backpack, but not both.\n4. Since the first statement says that the scarf 'might not be draped on the coat rack', it implies that the scarf is not draped on the coat rack.\n5.
