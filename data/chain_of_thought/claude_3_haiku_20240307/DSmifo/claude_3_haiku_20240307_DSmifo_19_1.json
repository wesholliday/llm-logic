We are given the statements:\n   - \"The watch might not be on his wrist\"\n   - \"Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser\"\n\n2. The first statement, \"The watch might not be on his wrist,\" suggests that the watch may not be on his wrist.\n\n3. The second statement, \"Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser,\" presents two possible scenarios: either the watch is on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser.\n\n4. Since the first statement suggests that the watch might not be on his wrist, the only remaining possibility is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The watch is charging on the dresser.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
