If the remote control is not under the couch (as suggested by the first statement), then it must be on the coffee table (as stated in the second statement).\n2. If the remote control is under the couch, then it cannot be on the coffee table (as stated in the second statement).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
