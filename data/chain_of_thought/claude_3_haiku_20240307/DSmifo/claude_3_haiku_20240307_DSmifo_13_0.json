We are given the following two statements:\n   - \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\"\n   - \"Either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box\"\n\n2. The first statement tells us that it is possible that the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that the toy must either be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box. This means that the toy cannot be anywhere else.\n\n4. Combining the two statements, we can infer that if the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf, then it must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
