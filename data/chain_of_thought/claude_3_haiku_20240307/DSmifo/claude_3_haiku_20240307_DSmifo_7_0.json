The first statement is 'The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet'. This means that the umbrella may or may not be in the closet.\n\n2. The second statement is 'Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car'. This means that the umbrella must be either in the closet or in the car, but not both.\n\n3. Since the first statement suggests that the umbrella might not be in the closet, and the second statement says that the umbrella must be either in the closet or in the car, we can infer that the umbrella must be in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes"
