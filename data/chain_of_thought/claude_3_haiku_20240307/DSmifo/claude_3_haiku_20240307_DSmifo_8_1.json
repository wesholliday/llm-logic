The first premise is 'The remote control might not be hiding under the couch'. This means that the remote control may or may not be hiding under the couch.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table'. This means that the remote control is either under the couch or on the coffee table, but not both.\n\n3. Now, given the first premise that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch, and the second premise that it is either under the couch or on the coffee table, we can infer that the remote control must be on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer 'The remote control is on the coffee table'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
