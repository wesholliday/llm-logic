This means that it is possible that Fido is not in the garden.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside\". This means that Fido must either be in the garden or inside, with no other possibilities.\n\n3. Now, if Fido might not be in the garden (from the first premise), and the only other possibility is that he is inside (from the second premise), then we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
