The second statement is: 'Either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair'.\n   This statement presents two mutually exclusive possibilities for the location of the jacket: either it is hanging in the closet, or it is draped over the chair.\n\nNow, considering the two statements together, we can make the following observations:\n- The first statement tells us that the jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\n- The second statement tells us that the jacket must either be hanging in the closet or draped over the chair.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that since the jacket might not be hanging in the closet, the only remaining possibility is that it is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes"
