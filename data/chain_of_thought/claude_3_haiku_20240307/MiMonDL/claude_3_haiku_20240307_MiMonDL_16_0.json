The original statement only suggests the possibility of a delay, but does not provide any information about the possibility of the flight being on time.\n\nThe statement \"The flight might be delayed or on time\" is a stronger statement that includes both the possibility of a delay and the possibility of the flight being on time. The original statement \"The flight might be delayed\" is a weaker statement that only covers the possibility of a delay, without making any claims about the possibility of the flight being on time.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The flight might be delayed or on time\" from the original statement \"The flight might be delayed\".\n\nAnswer: no"
