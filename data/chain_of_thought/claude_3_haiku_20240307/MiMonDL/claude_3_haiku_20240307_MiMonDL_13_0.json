It only states that the meeting might be cancelled. However, the statement \"The meeting might be cancelled or rescheduled\" is more specific and includes the additional possibility of the meeting being rescheduled.\n\nWhile the original statement \"The meeting might be cancelled\" does not rule out the possibility of the meeting being rescheduled, it also does not directly imply or state that the meeting might be rescheduled. The original statement is more general and does not provide information about what might happen to the meeting if it is not cancelled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The meeting might be cancelled or rescheduled\" from the original statement \"The meeting might be cancelled\" alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
