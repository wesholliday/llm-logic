            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The computer might be broken or working' from 'The computer might be broken', we need to consider the logical implications of the given statement.\n\nThe statement 'The computer might be broken' implies that there is a possibility that the computer is broken. However, this does not necessarily mean that the computer is not working. The statement does not rule out the possibility that the computer might be working.\n\nThe statement 'The computer might be broken or working' is a disjunction, which means that either the computer is broken or it is working, or both. This statement is broader and encompasses the possibility that the computer might be broken, as well as the possibility that it might be working.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The computer might be broken or working' from the statement 'The computer might be broken' because the latter statement is a more specific case of the former.\n\nAnswer: yes"
