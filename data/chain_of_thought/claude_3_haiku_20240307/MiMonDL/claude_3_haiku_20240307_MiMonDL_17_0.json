The original statement only suggests the possibility that the concert is sold out, but it does not provide any information about the availability of tickets.\n\nTo infer that the concert might be sold out or have available tickets, we would need additional information that indicates the concert could have either of those two outcomes. The original statement alone does not provide enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
