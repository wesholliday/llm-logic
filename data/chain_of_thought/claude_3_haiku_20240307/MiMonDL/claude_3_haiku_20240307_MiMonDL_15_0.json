The original statement only suggests that there is a possibility that the student will pass the exam, but it does not provide any information about the possibility of the student failing the exam.\n\nTo infer that the student might pass the exam or fail, we would need additional information or a more specific statement that explicitly mentions both the possibility of passing and the possibility of failing the exam.\n\nAnswer: no"
