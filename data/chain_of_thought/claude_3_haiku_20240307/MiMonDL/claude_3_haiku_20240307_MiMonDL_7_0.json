The original statement only suggests the possibility of the train being late, but does not provide any information about the possibility of the train being on time.\n\nThe statement \"The train might be late or on time\" would be a stronger and more inclusive statement, as it covers both the possibility of the train being late and the possibility of the train being on time. However, the original statement \"The train might be late\" does not explicitly include the possibility of the train being on time.\n\nAnswer: no"
