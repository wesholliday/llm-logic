The statement only suggests that the team has a possibility of winning the game, but it does not provide any information about the possibility of the team losing the game.\n\nThe statement \"The team might win the game or lose\" would be a stronger statement that includes both the possibility of winning and the possibility of losing. However, the original statement \"The team might win the game\" does not explicitly state or imply the possibility of the team losing the game.\n\nAnswer: no"
