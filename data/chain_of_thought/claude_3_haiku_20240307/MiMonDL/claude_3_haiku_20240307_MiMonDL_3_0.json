The original statement only suggests that the keys might be in the drawer, but it does not rule out the possibility that the keys might be somewhere else, such as on the table.\n\nTo infer that the keys might be in the drawer or on the table, we would need additional information that explicitly states or implies that the keys could be in either of those locations. The original statement does not provide that information.\n\nAnswer: no"
