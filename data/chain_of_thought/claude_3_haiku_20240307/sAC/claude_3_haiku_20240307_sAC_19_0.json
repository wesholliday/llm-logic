This means that if the antecedent (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequent (Jen watched basketball) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement, \"Jen watched basketball,\" is a true statement.\n\nNow, we need to determine if the truth of the second statement, \"Jen watched basketball,\" implies the truth of the first statement, \"Tom watched football.\"\n\nThe logical reasoning is as follows:\n1. If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball (given)\n2. Jen watched basketball (given)\n3. From the first statement, we can conclude that if the consequent (Jen watched basketball) is true, then the antecedent (Tom watched football) must also be true.\n\nHowever, the truth of the consequent (Jen watched basketball) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (Tom watched football). The conditional statement only works in one direction, from the antecedent to the consequent, not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, the truth of \"Jen watched basketball\" does not necessarily mean that \"Tom watched football\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: no"
