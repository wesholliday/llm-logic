We know that \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is true.\n2. We also know that \"Chris finished the race\" is true.\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. Since we know that Chris finished the race, this means that the condition \"If Alex finished the race\" must be true.\n4. However, the statement \"Alex finished the race\" does not necessarily follow from the given information. The first statement only tells us that if Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished the race. It does not tell us whether Alex actually finished the race or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \"Alex finished the race\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
