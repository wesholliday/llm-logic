We are also given that \"Erin took a train\" is true.\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. This means that if Erin took a train, then Sam must have taken a plane.\n4. Since we know that Erin took a train, we can conclude that Sam must have taken a plane.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
