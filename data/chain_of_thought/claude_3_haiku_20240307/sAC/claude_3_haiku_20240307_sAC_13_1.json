However, this does not necessarily imply that if the truck was blue, then the car must have been red.\n\nThe second statement is a categorical statement: \"The truck was blue.\" This statement is true, according to the information provided.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the truth of the first two statements implies the truth of the third statement: \"The car was red.\"\n\nThe key to this problem is that the first statement is a conditional statement, not a biconditional statement. A biconditional statement would be \"The car was red if and only if the truck was blue,\" which would imply that the truth of the truck being blue is necessary and sufficient for the car being red.\n\nHowever, the given conditional statement only tells us that if the car was red, then the truck was blue.
