            "content": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the given information and the logical implications.\n\nThe first statement, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" is a conditional statement. This means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. However, this statement does not necessarily imply that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nThe second statement, \"Sue was at the wedding,\" is true. This means that the consequent of the first statement, \"Sue was at the wedding,\" is true.\n\nNow, the question is whether we can conclude that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true.\n\nTo do this, we need to use the rules of logical inference. Since the first statement is a conditional statement, and the consequent of that statement is true, we can apply the rule of modus ponens. This rule states that if a conditional statement is true and the antecedent is true, then the consequent is also true.\n\nHowever, in this case, we do not have information about the antecedent, \"Mary was at the wedding.\" The first statement only tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding, but it does not tell us whether Mary was actually at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
