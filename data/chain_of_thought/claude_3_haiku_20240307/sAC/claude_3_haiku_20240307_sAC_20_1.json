This means that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red. The conditional statement only tells us about the relationship in one direction.\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement: \"The banana was yellow\". This statement is true.\n\nNow, the question is asking whether it follows that \"The apple was red\" is true.\n\nTo determine this, we need to consider the implications of the given information.\n\nSince the first statement is a conditional statement, and the second statement is true, we can use the rule of modus ponens to conclude that the apple was red. Modus ponens states that if a conditional statement is true and the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is true, then the consequent (the \"then\" part) is also true.\n\nHowever, we cannot reverse this logic and conclude that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red. This would be the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nTherefore, given the information provided, it does follow that \"The apple was red\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
