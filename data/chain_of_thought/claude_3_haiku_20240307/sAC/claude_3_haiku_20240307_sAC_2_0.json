We are given that \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" is true.\n2. We are also given that \"The unicorn was in the forest\" is true.\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n4. Since we know the unicorn was in the forest, we can conclude that the griffin must have also been in the forest.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
