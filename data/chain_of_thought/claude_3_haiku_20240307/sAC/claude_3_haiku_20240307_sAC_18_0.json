            "content": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the given information and the logical implications.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This means that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement: \"The truck was metal.\" This statement is true.\n\nNow, the question is whether the third statement, \"The doll was plastic,\" follows from the given information.\n\nTo determine this, we need to consider the logical implications of the conditional statement and the true statement.\n\nThe conditional statement, \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal,\" does not tell us anything about the doll being plastic. It only tells us that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nSince the second statement, \"The truck was metal,\" is true, we can conclude that the doll was plastic. However, this is not a logical necessity based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no"
