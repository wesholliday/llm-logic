The first statement, \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" is a conditional statement. It means that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake.\n2. The second statement, \"The mummy was awake,\" is true.\n3. From the first statement, we know that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. Since we know that the mummy was awake, we can infer that the vampire must have been awake as well.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
