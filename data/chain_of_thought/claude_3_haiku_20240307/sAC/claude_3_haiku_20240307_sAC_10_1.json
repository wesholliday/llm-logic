However, this statement does not tell us anything about the actual location of the dog.\n\nThe second statement, \"The cat was outside,\" is a simple declarative statement that directly states the location of the cat.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Does it follow that 'The dog was inside' is true?\"\n\nTo answer this, we need to look at the logical implications of the information we have.

A conditional statement only tells us what happens if the antecedent (the dog was inside) is true, but it does not tell us anything about the converse (if the cat was outside, the dog was inside).\n\nTherefore, even though we know the cat was outside (the second statement), we cannot conclude that the dog was inside.
