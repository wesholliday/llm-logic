We are given two statements:\n   - \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is true.\n   - \"Bob chose pasta\" is true.\n\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. This means that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob may or may not have chosen pasta.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that Bob did, in fact, choose pasta.\n\n4. However, the fact that Bob chose pasta does not necessarily mean that Sue chose pizza. It is possible that Sue did not choose pizza, and Bob still chose pasta for some other reason.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \"Sue chose pizza\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
