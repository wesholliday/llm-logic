            "content": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the given information and the logic behind the statements.\n\nThe first statement, \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal,\" is a conditional statement. This statement means that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. In other words, the doll being plastic is a sufficient condition for the truck being metal.\n\nThe second statement, \"The truck was metal,\" is a simple statement that directly states the condition about the truck.\n\nNow, the question is whether the third statement, \"The doll was plastic,\" follows from the given information.\n\nTo determine this, we need to consider the logical structure of the conditional statement and the information provided.\n\nThe first statement, \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal,\" does not necessarily mean that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic. This is because the conditional statement only establishes a one-way relationship, from the doll being plastic to the truck being metal, but not the other way around.\n\nAdditionally, the second statement, \"The truck was metal,\" does not provide any information about the material of the doll.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \"The doll was plastic\" is true. The information provided is not sufficient to determine the material of the doll.\n\nAnswer: no"
