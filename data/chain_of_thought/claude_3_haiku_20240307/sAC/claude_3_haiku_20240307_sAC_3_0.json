We are given two statements:\n   a) \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is true.\n   b) \"The book is a mystery novel\" is true.\n\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if the book is a mystery novel, then it was written by James. This is because the first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", which means that if B is true, then A must also be true.\n\n3. Since we know that \"The book is a mystery novel\" is true, we can apply the logic from the first statement and conclude that \"The book was written by James\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
