However, this does not necessarily mean that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was also awake.\n\nStep 2: Consider the second statement, \"The mummy was awake.\"\nSince we know that the mummy was awake, we can infer that the condition in the first statement is satisfied. That is, the vampire was awake.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that \"The vampire was awake\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
