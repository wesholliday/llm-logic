This means that if the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) is true, then the consequent (Amy played tennis) must also be true. However, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. In other words, just because the consequent is true (Amy played tennis), it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent is also true (Jeff played basketball).\n\nThe second statement, \"Amy played tennis,\" is true. This means that the consequent of the first statement is true.\n\nNow, the question is whether we can infer that the antecedent of the first statement, \"Jeff played basketball,\" is also true.\n\nThe answer is: No.\n\nAnswer: no"
