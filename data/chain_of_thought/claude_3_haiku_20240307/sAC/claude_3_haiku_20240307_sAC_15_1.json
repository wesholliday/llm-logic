This is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Sam took a plane) is true, then the second part (Erin took a train) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Erin took a train\". This statement is true.\n\n3. Now, we need to determine if the first part of the conditional statement, \"Sam took a plane\", is also true.\n\nThe key here is that the conditional statement only tells us that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. It does not tell us anything about whether Sam actually took a plane or not.\n\nSince we know that Erin took a train (the second statement), we can infer that the first part of the conditional statement, \"Sam took a plane\", must also be true. However, this is not a necessary conclusion.\n\nIt is possible that Sam did not take a plane, and there is another reason why Erin took a train. The conditional statement does not tell us anything about this.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \"Sam took a plane\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
