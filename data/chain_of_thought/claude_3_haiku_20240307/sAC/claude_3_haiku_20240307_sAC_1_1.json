            "content": "Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:\n\n1. The first statement is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\". This is a conditional statement, which means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. However, it does not necessarily mean that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was also at the wedding.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Sue was at the wedding\". This is a true statement.\n\n3. Now, the question is asking whether it follows that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true.\n\nTo answer this, we need to consider the logical implication of the first statement and the second statement.\n\nSince the first statement is a conditional statement, and the second statement is true, we can use the rule of modus ponens to conclude that the consequent of the first statement is also true. In other words, if the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequent (Sue was at the wedding) is also true.\n\nHowever, the reverse is not necessarily true. Just because the consequent is true (Sue was at the wedding), it does not automatically mean that the antecedent is also true (Mary was at the wedding).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no"
