However, this statement does not tell us anything about the converse, which would be \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the cave.\"\n\nThe second statement, \"The wolf was in the den,\" is true.\n\nNow, we need to consider the logical relationship between these two statements.\n\nIf the first statement is true and the second statement is true, it does not necessarily follow that the third statement, \"The bear was in the cave,\" is also true.
