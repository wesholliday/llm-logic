This means that the smonk must be either plagged or vreebled, but not both.\n\nThe second premise is 'The smonk might not be plagged'. This means that it is possible for the smonk to not be plagged.\n\nNow, let's consider the two possibilities:\n1. If the smonk is not plagged, then it must be vreebled, according to the first premise.\n2. If the smonk is plagged, then it cannot be vreebled, according to the first premise.\n\nSince the second premise states that the smonk might not be plagged, the first possibility is more likely. Therefore, we can infer that 'The smonk is vreebled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
