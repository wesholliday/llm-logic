The first premise is \"Either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled.\" This means that the fribble must either be crinked or snurgled, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is \"The fribble might not be crinked.\" This means that it is possible that the fribble is not crinked.\n\n3. From the first premise, we know that if the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled. \n\n4. Since the second premise tells us that the fribble might not be crinked, we can infer that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
