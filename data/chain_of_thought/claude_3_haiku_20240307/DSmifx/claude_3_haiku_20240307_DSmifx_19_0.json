The first statement is 'Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled'. This means that the smonk is either plagged or vreebled, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is 'The smonk might not be plagged'. This means that it is possible that the smonk is not plagged.\n\nNow, let's consider the two possibilities:\n- If the smonk is not plagged, then it must be vreebled, based on the first statement.\n- If the smonk is plagged, then it cannot be vreebled, again based on the first statement.\n\nSince the second statement tells us that the smonk might not be plagged, we can infer that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
