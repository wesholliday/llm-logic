The first statement is 'Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked'. This means that the sprocket must be either daggled or cranked, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is 'The sprocket might not be daggled'. This means that it is possible that the sprocket is not daggled.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\nIf the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked, according to the first statement. This is because the first statement says that the sprocket must be either daggled or cranked, and if it is not daggled, then it must be cranked.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that 'The sprocket is cranked'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
