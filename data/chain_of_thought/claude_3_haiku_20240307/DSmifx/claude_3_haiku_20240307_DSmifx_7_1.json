The first statement is \"Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked.\" This means that the whiffle must either be tinked or shanked, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The whiffle might not be tinked.\" This means that it's possible the whiffle is not tinked.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n   - If the whiffle is not tinked, then by the first statement, it must be shanked.\n   - If the whiffle is tinked, then by the first statement, it cannot be shanked.\n\n4.
