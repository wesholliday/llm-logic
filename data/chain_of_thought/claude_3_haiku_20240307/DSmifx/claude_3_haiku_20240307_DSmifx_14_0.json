The first statement is \"Either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked.\" This means that the clug is either snugged or fleeked, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The clug might not be snugged.\" This means that it is possible that the clug is not snugged.\n\n3. From the first statement, we know that if the clug is not snugged, then it must be fleeked.\n\n4. Therefore, from the second statement, we can infer that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
