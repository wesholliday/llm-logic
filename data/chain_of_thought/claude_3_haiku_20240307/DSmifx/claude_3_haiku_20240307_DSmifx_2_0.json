The first premise is 'Either the wug must be bimmed or it is flooped'. This means that the wug must either be bimmed or it is flooped, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is 'The wug might not be bimmed'. This means that it is possible that the wug is not bimmed.\n\n3. If the wug might not be bimmed, and the wug must either be bimmed or flooped, then the only remaining possibility is that the wug is flooped.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that 'The wug is flooped'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
