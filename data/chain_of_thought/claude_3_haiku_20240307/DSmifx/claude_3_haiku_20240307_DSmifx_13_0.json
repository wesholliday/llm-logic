The first premise is 'Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged'. This means that the glip must either be tragged or slogged, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is 'The glip might not be tragged'. This means that it is possible that the glip is not tragged.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\nIf the glip is not tragged, then by the first premise, it must be slogged. This is because the first premise states that the glip must either be tragged or slogged, and if it is not tragged, then it must be slogged.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that 'The glip is slogged'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
