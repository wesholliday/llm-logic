The first statement is: \"Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked.\"\n   This means that the shank is either nugged or plooked, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The shank might not be nugged.\"\n   This means that it is possible that the shank is not nugged.\n\n3. From the first statement, we know that if the shank is not nugged, then it must be plooked.\n   This is because the first statement says that the shank must be either nugged or plooked.\n\n4.
