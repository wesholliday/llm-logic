The first premise is 'Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled'. This means that the zinger must either be smoogled or fraggled, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is 'The zinger might not be smoogled'. This means that it is possible that the zinger is not smoogled.\n\n3. If the zinger might not be smoogled, and it must either be smoogled or fraggled, then the only remaining possibility is that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer 'The zinger is fraggled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
