This means that the dreb is either spened or vroombed, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The dreb might not be spened\". This means that it is possible that the dreb is not spened.\n\n3. If the dreb might not be spened, and the dreb must either be spened or vroombed, then the only other possibility is that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The dreb is vroombed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
