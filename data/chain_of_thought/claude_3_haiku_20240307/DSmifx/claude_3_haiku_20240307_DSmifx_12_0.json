This means that the smip must either be lupped or it is shripped.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The smip might not be lupped\". This means that it is possible that the smip is not lupped.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the two possibilities:\n   a) If the smip is not lupped, then it must be shripped (based on the first statement).\n   b) If the smip is lupped, then it cannot be shripped (based on the first statement).\n\n4. Since the second statement tells us that the smip might not be lupped, the only possibility is that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes"
