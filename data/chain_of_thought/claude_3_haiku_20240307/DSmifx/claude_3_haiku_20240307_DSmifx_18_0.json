The first statement is: \"Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked.\"\n   This means that the shank must either be nugged or plooked, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The shank might not be nugged.\"\n   This means that it is possible that the shank is not nugged.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the two possibilities:\n   a) If the shank is not nugged, then it must be plooked, according to the first statement.\n   b) If the shank is nugged, then it cannot be plooked, according to the first statement.\n\n4. Since the second statement tells us that the shank might not be nugged, the only possibility left is that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
