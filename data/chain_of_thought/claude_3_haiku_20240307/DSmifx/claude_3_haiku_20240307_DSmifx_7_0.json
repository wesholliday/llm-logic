The first premise is 'Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked'. This means that the whiffle must be either tinked or shanked, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is 'The whiffle might not be tinked'. This means that it is possible that the whiffle is not tinked.\n\n3. If the whiffle might not be tinked, and it must be either tinked or shanked, then the only remaining possibility is that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that 'The whiffle is shanked'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
