The first statement is \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed.\" This means that the splat must either be quanked or it is morphed, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The splat might not be quanked.\" This means that it is possible that the splat is not quanked.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the two possibilities:\n   a) If the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed, according to the first statement.\n   b) If the splat is quanked, then it cannot be morphed, according to the first statement.\n\n4. Since the second statement tells us that the splat might not be quanked, we can infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
