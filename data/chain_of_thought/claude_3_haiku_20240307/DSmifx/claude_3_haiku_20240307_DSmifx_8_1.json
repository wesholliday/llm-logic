The first premise is 'Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked.' This means that the sprocket must be either daggled or cranked, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is 'The sprocket might not be daggled.' This means that it is possible that the sprocket is not daggled.\n\n3. From the first premise, we know that if the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked.\n\n4. Combining the two premises, we can conclude that if the sprocket is not daggled, then it is cranked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The sprocket is cranked.'\n\nAnswer: yes"
