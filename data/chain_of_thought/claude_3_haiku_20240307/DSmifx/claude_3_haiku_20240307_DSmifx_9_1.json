We are given the first statement: 'Either the twonk must be varnished or it is plinked'.\n2. This means that the twonk is either varnished or plinked, but not both.\n3. We are also given the second statement: 'The twonk might not be plinked'.\n4. This means that the twonk is not necessarily plinked.\n5. If the twonk is not plinked, then it must be varnished, as per the first statement.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that 'The twonk is varnished'.\n\nAnswer: yes"

If the twonk is not plinked, then it must be varnished, based on the first premise.\n2. If the twonk is plinked, then it cannot be varnished, based on the first premise.\n\nSince the second premise states that the twonk might not be plinked, we can infer that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes"
