The first premise is 'Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled'. This means that the flob must either be movated or skizzled, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is 'The flob might not be movated'. This means that it is possible that the flob is not movated.\n\n3. From the first premise, we know that if the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled. Since the second premise tells us that the flob might not be movated, we can infer that the flob is skizzled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that 'The flob is skizzled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
