The first premise is 'Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed'. This means that the grommet must be either plopped or sploffed, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is 'The grommet might not be plopped'. This means that it is possible that the grommet is not plopped.\n\n3. If the grommet is not plopped, and the first premise states that it must be either plopped or sploffed, then the only remaining option is that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that 'The grommet is sploffed'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
