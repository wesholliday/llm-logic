The first premise is 'Either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged'. This means that the wug must be either garpled or sproinged, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is 'The wug might not be garpled'. This means that it is possible that the wug is not garpled.\n\n3. If the wug might not be garpled, and it must be either garpled or sproinged, then the only remaining possibility is that the wug is sproinged.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that 'The wug is sproinged'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
