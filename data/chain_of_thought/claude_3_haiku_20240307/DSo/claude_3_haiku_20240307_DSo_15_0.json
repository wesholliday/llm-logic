We are given two premises:\n   a) \"The shoes aren't lined up by the door\"\n   b) \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they are lined up by the door\"\n\n2. From premise (a), we can infer that the shoes are not lined up by the door.\n\n3. From premise (b), we can infer that the shoes must be either in the closet or lined up by the door.\n\n4. Since we know from premise (a) that the shoes are not lined up by the door, the only remaining possibility is that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The shoes are in the closet\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
