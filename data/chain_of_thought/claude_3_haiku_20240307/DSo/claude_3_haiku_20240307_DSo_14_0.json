We also have the premise: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it is chilling in the fridge\".\n3. From the first premise, we know that the milk is not chilling in the fridge.\n4. From the second premise, we know that the milk must either be on the counter or chilling in the fridge.\n5. Since the milk is not chilling in the fridge (from the first premise), the only remaining possibility is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The milk is on the counter\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
