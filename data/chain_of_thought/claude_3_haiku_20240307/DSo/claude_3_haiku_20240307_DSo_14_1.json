We are given two statements:\n   - \"The milk isn't chilling in the fridge\"\n   - \"Either the milk is on the counter or it is chilling in the fridge\"\n\n2. The second statement is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two possibilities must be true: either the milk is on the counter, or it is chilling in the fridge.\n\n3. The first statement tells us that the milk is not chilling in the fridge. This means that the only remaining possibility from the disjunction is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
