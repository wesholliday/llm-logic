We are given the following information:\n   - \"The watch isn't on his wrist\"\n   - \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist\"\n\n2. From the first statement, we know that the watch is not on his wrist.\n\n3. The second statement gives us two possibilities: either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist.\n\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the watch is not on his wrist, the only remaining possibility is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The watch is charging on the dresser\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
