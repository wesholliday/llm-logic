We are given the following two statements:\n   - \"The jacket isn't hanging in the closet\"\n   - \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it is hanging in the closet\"\n\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that the jacket is not hanging in the closet.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that the jacket is either draped over the chair or hanging in the closet.\n\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the jacket is not hanging in the closet, the only remaining possibility is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes"
