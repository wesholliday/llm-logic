We are also given the statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry\".\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry.\n4. From the second statement, we can infer that the cookies must be either in the jar or hidden in the pantry.\n5. Since the cookies are not hidden in the pantry (from the first statement), the only remaining possibility is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
