We are given the following two statements:\n   - \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet\"\n   - \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet\"\n\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that the keys are not in the cabinet.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that the keys are either in the drawer or dangling in the cabinet.\n\n4. Since we know the keys are not dangling in the cabinet (from the first statement), the only remaining possibility is that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
