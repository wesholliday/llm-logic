We are given the statements:\n   - \"Fido is not in the garden\"\n   - \"Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden\"\n\n2. The second statement is a disjunction, which means that one of the two possibilities must be true: either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden.\n\n3. The first statement tells us that Fido is not in the garden.\n\n4. Since Fido is not in the garden, and the only two possibilities are that Fido is either inside or in the garden, we can infer that Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
