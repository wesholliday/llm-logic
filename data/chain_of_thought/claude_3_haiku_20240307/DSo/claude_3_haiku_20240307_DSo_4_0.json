We are given the following two statements:\n   - \"The cat isn't playing in the bedroom\"\n   - \"Either the cat is napping on the couch or it's playing in the bedroom\"\n\n2. From the second statement, we can infer that the cat is either napping on the couch or playing in the bedroom. This is because the statement uses the word \"or\", which means that one of the two options must be true.\n\n3. However, the first statement tells us that the cat is not playing in the bedroom. This means that the only remaining option from the second statement is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The cat is napping on the couch\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
