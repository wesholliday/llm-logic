We are given the following two statements:\n   - \"The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor\"\n   - \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it is blending in on the floor\"\n\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor.\n\n3. The second statement gives us two possibilities: either the missing puzzle piece is in the box, or it is blending in on the floor.\n\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, the only remaining possibility is that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
