We are given the following two premises:\n   - \"The missing sock isn't under the bed\"\n   - \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it's under the bed\"\n\n2. The first premise tells us that the missing sock is not under the bed.\n\n3. The second premise gives us two possibilities for the location of the missing sock: either it is in the laundry basket or it is under the bed.\n\n4. Since the first premise tells us that the missing sock is not under the bed, the only remaining possibility from the second premise is that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes"
