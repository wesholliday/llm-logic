We are also given the statement: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand.\"\n3. From the first statement, we know that the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand.\n4. From the second statement, we know that the notebook is either in the drawer or sitting on the nightstand.\n5. Since the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand (from the first statement), the only remaining possibility is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The notebook is in the drawer.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
