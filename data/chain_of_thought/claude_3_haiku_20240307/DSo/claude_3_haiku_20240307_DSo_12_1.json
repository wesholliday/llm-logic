The second statement provides two possible locations for the jacket: either it is draped over the chair or it is hanging in the closet.\n\nSince the first statement has already ruled out the jacket being hanging in the closet, the only remaining possibility is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes"
