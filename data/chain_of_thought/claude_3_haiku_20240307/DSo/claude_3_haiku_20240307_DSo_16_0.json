We are also given the statement \"Either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that the pen is not on the desk.\n4. From the second statement, we can infer that the pen must be either in the bag or on the desk, since those are the only two possibilities presented.\n5. Since the pen is not on the desk (from the first statement), the only remaining possibility is that the pen is in the bag.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The pen is in my bag.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
