'The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor': This statement tells us that the missing puzzle piece is not on the floor.\n\n2. 'Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it is blending in on the floor': This statement provides two possible locations for the missing puzzle piece: either it is in the box, or it is blending in on the floor.\n\nGiven the first statement that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, we can eliminate the second possibility from the second statement. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
