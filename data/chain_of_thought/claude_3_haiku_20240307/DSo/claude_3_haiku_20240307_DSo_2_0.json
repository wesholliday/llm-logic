We are given the following two statements:\n   - \"The book isn't resting on the table\"\n   - \"Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table\"\n\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that the book is not on the table.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that the book is either on the shelf or on the table.\n\n4. Since we know the book is not on the table (from the first statement), the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The book is on the shelf\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
