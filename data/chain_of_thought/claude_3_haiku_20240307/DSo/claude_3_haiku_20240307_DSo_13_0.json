We are given the following two statements:\n   - \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf\"\n   - \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf\"\n\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that the toy is not sitting on the shelf.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that the toy is either in the toy box or sitting on the shelf.\n\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the toy is not sitting on the shelf, the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
