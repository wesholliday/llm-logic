We are given the following premises:\n   - \"The apple was not red\"\n   - \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\"\n\n2. From the first premise, we know that the apple was not red.\n\n3. The second premise is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This means that if the apple was red, the banana would have been yellow.\n\n4. Since the apple was not red (from the first premise), the condition \"If the apple was red\" is not satisfied. This means that we cannot infer anything about the color of the banana.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The banana was not yellow\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
