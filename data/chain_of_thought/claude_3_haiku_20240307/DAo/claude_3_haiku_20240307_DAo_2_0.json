We are given the statement 'The griffin was not in the forest'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the griffin was in the forest) is true, then the consequent (the unicorn was in the forest) must also be true.\n4. Since the first statement tells us that the griffin was not in the forest, the antecedent of the conditional statement is false.\n5. When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the entire statement is considered to be true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nAnswer: no"
