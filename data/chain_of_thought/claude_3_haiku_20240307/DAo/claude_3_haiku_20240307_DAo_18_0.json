The first statement is 'The doll was not plastic'. This means that the doll is not made of plastic.\n\n2. The second statement is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. However, the antecedent (the doll is plastic) is false, based on the first statement.\n\n3. When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the entire statement is considered to be true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent (the truck is metal).\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot infer 'The truck was not metal'. The second statement does not provide any information about the material of the truck.\n\nAnswer: no"
