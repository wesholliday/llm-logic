We are given the statement 'The cake was not chocolate'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the cake was chocolate) is true, then the consequent (the muffins were blueberry) must also be true.\n4. Since we know that the cake was not chocolate (from the first statement), the antecedent of the conditional statement is false.\n5. When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the entire statement is considered to be true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that the consequent, 'the muffins were blueberry', is also false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
