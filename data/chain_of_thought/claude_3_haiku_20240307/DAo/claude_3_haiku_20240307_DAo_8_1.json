We are given two premises:\n   - \"The vampire was not awake\"\n   - \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\"\n\n2. From the second premise, we can infer that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was also not awake. This is because the second premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n\n3. Since the first premise tells us that \"The vampire was not awake\", we can infer from the second premise that \"The mummy was not awake\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
