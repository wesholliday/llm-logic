We are given the statement 'The apple was not red'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the apple was red) is true, then the consequent (the banana was yellow) must also be true.\n4. However, since the first statement tells us that the apple was not red, the antecedent of the conditional statement is false.\n5. When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the entire statement is considered to be true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent.\n6. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The banana was not yellow' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
