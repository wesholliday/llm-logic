We are given the statement 'Mary was not at the wedding'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequent (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true.\n4. Since we know that Mary was not at the wedding, the antecedent of the conditional statement is false.\n5. When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the entire statement is considered to be true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no"
