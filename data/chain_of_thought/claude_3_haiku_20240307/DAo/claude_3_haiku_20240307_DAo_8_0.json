We are given the statement 'The vampire was not awake'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake'.\n3. From the first statement, we know that the vampire was not awake.\n4. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n5. Since we know the vampire was not awake, the condition in the second statement is not met. This means that the conclusion 'the mummy was awake' does not necessarily follow.\n6. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The mummy was not awake' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
