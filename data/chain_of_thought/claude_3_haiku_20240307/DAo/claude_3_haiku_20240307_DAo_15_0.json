If Sam did not take a plane, then the condition \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is not satisfied.\n2. When the condition in a conditional statement is not satisfied, the conclusion does not necessarily follow.\n3. Therefore, from the given information, we cannot infer that \"Erin did not take a train.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
