We are given the statement 'The shirt was not cotton'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the shirt was cotton) is true, then the consequent (the pants were denim) must also be true.\n4. Since the first statement tells us that the shirt was not cotton, the antecedent of the conditional statement is false.\n5. When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the entire statement is considered to be true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent.\n6. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the pants being denim or not denim from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
