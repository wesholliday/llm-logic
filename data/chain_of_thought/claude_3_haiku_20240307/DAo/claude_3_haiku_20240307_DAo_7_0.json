'Alex did not finish the race': This statement tells us that Alex did not complete the race.\n\n2. 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race': This is a conditional statement, which means that if Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished the race. However, this does not imply that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\n\nThe given information does not provide enough information to determine whether Chris finished the race or not. The fact that Alex did not finish the race does not necessarily mean that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Chris did not finish the race' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
