We are given the statement 'The dog was not inside'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside'.\n3. The statement 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' is a conditional statement. It means that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.\n4. From the given information, we can only conclude that if the dog was not inside, we cannot infer anything about the location of the cat. The cat could be either outside or not outside.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The cat was not outside' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
