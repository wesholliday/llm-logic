We are given the statement 'Sue did not choose pizza'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the consequent (Bob chose pasta) is also true.\n4. Since we know that 'Sue did not choose pizza', the antecedent of the conditional statement is false.\n5. When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the entire statement is considered to be true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that 'Bob did not choose pasta'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
