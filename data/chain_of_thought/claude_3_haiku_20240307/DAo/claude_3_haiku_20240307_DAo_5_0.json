We are given the statement 'Jeff did not play basketball'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) is true, then the consequent (Amy played tennis) must also be true.\n4. However, since we know that 'Jeff did not play basketball' (the antecedent is false), we cannot conclude anything about the consequent (Amy played tennis).\n5. The fact that Jeff did not play basketball does not necessarily mean that Amy did not play tennis.\n\nAnswer: no"
