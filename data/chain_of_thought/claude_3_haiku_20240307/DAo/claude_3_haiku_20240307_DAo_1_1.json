It means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. This does not imply anything about Sue's presence if Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nStep 2: Consider the first statement.\nThe first statement, \"Mary was not at the wedding,\" tells us that Mary was not present at the wedding.\n\nStep 3: Combine the two statements.\nSince we know that Mary was not at the wedding, the conditional statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" does not apply. This means that we cannot infer anything about Sue's presence at the wedding based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"Sue was not at the wedding\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
