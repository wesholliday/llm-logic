'Tom did not watch football': This means that Tom did not watch football.\n\n2. 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball': This is a conditional statement. It states that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. However, this does not necessarily mean that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nThe given information does not provide any direct information about whether Jen watched basketball or not. The only information we have is that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. But since we know that Tom did not watch football, we cannot infer anything about Jen's actions.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Jen did not watch basketball' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
