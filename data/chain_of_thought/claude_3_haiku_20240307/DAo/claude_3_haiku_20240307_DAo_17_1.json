We are given the following two statements:\n   - \"Ben did not eat pasta\"\n   - \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\"\n\n2. The first statement tells us that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the consequent (Kate ate salad) must also be true.\n\n4. Since we know that Ben did not eat pasta (the antecedent is false), the conditional statement does not tell us anything about whether Kate ate salad or not.\n\n5. Therefore, from the given information, we cannot infer that \"Kate did not eat salad\".\n\nAnswer: no"
