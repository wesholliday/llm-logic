The first statement is 'The car was not red'. This means that the car is not red.\n\n2. The second statement is 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the car is not red, then the truck is not blue.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The truck was not blue'. The information provided is not sufficient to draw that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
