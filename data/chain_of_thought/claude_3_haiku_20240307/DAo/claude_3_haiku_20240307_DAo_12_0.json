We are given the statement 'Joe did not go to the park'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Joe went to the park) is true, then the consequent (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true.\n4. However, since we know that Joe did not go to the park (the antecedent is false), we cannot conclude anything about the consequent (whether Lucy went to the zoo or not).\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Lucy did not go to the zoo' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
