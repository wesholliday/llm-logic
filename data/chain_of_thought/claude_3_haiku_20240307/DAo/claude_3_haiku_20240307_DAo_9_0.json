We are given the statement 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n3. From the first statement, we know that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n4. If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then the condition 'If Lisa bought the red shirt' in the second statement is not met.\n5. If the condition 'If Lisa bought the red shirt' is not met, then the conclusion 'then Mark bought the blue shirt' does not necessarily follow.\n6. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
