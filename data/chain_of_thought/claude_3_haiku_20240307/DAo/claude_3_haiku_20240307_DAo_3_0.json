We are given the statement 'The book was not written by James'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel'.\n3. The first statement tells us that the book was not written by James.\n4. The second statement is a conditional statement that says if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel.\n5. Since the first statement tells us that the book was not written by James, the condition in the second statement is not met.\n6. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the book is a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: yes"
