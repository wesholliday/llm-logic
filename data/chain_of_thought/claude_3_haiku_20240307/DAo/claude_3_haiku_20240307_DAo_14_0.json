We are given the statement 'The bear was not in the cave'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the bear was in the cave) is true, then the consequent (the wolf was in the den) must also be true.\n4. Since the first statement tells us that the bear was not in the cave, the antecedent of the conditional statement is false.\n5. When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the entire statement is considered to be true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that the wolf was in the den.\n\nAnswer: no"
