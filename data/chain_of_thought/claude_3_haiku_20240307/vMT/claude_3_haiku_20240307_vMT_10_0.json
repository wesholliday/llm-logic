            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following structure:\nPremise 1: If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\nPremise 2: The cat was not outside.\nConclusion: The dog was not inside.\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we can use the rules of propositional logic.\n\nThe first premise, \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside,\" can be represented as the conditional statement: \"If P, then Q,\" where P represents \"the dog was inside\" and Q represents \"the cat was outside.\"\n\nThe second premise, \"The cat was not outside,\" can be represented as the negation of Q, which is \"not Q.\"\n\nThe conclusion, \"The dog was not inside,\" can be represented as the negation of P, which is \"not P.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the logical validity of the argument:\nIf the first premise is true (i.e., \"If P, then Q\") and the second premise is true (i.e., \"not Q\"), then we can logically conclude that \"not P\" is also true, which corresponds to the conclusion.\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus tollens, and it is a valid form of logical inference. The conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
