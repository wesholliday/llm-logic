            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe argument has the following structure:\nPremise 1: If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\nPremise 2: The muffins were not blueberry.\nConclusion: The cake was not chocolate.\n\nLet's break down the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. This is a conditional statement in the form of \"If A, then B\".\n2. The second premise states that the muffins were not blueberry.\n3. To arrive at the conclusion that the cake was not chocolate, we can use the principle of modus tollens, which states that if the consequent (B) is false, then the antecedent (A) must also be false.\n\nApplying the modus tollens principle:\nIf the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry (Premise 1)\nThe muffins were not blueberry (Premise 2)\nTherefore, the cake was not chocolate (Conclusion)\n\nThis form of argument, known as modus tollens, is a logically valid form of reasoning.\n\nAnswer: yes"
