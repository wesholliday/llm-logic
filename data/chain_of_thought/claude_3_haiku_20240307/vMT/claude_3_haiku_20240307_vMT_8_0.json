            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following structure:\nPremise 1: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\nPremise 2: The mummy was not awake.\nConclusion: The vampire was not awake.\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we can use the rules of propositional logic.\n\nThe first premise, \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" can be represented as the conditional statement: \"P \u2192 Q,\" where P represents \"the vampire was awake\" and Q represents \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\nThe second premise, \"The mummy was not awake,\" can be represented as the negation of Q, which is \"\u00acQ.\"\n\nThe conclusion, \"The vampire was not awake,\" can be represented as the negation of P, which is \"\u00acP.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the logical validity of the argument:\nIf the first premise is true (P \u2192 Q) and the second premise is true (\u00acQ), then we can logically conclude that the first premise must be false (\u00acP), which is the conclusion of the argument.\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus tollens, and it is a valid form of logical reasoning. The conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
