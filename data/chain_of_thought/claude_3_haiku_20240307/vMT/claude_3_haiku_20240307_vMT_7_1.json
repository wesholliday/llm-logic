If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n2. Chris did not finish the race.\n3. Therefore, Alex did not finish the race.\n\nThis form of argument is known as a \"modus tollens\" logical argument. The structure of a modus tollens argument is as follows:\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn the given argument, P represents \"Alex finished the race\" and Q represents \"Chris finished the race\". The second premise, \"Chris did not finish the race,\" is equivalent to \"Not Q.\"\n\nThe modus tollens form of argument is logically valid, meaning that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
