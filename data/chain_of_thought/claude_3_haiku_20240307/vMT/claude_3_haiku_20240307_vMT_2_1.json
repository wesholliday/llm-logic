If the first premise is true, then if the griffin was in the forest, the unicorn must have been in the forest as well.\n2. The second premise tells us that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n3. Since the first premise states that the unicorn being in the forest is a necessary condition for the griffin being in the forest, and the second premise tells us that the unicorn was not in the forest, we can logically conclude that the griffin was also not in the forest.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
