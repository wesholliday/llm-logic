            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\nPremise 2: Chris did not finish the race.\nConclusion: Alex did not finish the race.\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we can use the principle of modus tollens, which states that if the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, then the consequent must also be false.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" The second premise tells us that Chris did not finish the race, which means the consequent of the conditional statement is false.\n\nAccording to the principle of modus tollens, if the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false. Therefore, the conclusion \"Alex did not finish the race\" follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
