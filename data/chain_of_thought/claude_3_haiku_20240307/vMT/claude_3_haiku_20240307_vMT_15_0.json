            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\nPremise 2: Erin did not take a train.\nConclusion: Sam did not take a plane.\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity of this argument, we can use the rules of propositional logic.\n\nThe first premise, \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train,\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the antecedent (Sam took a plane) is true, then the consequent (Erin took a train) must also be true.\n\nThe second premise, \"Erin did not take a train,\" is the negation of the consequent in the first premise.\n\nThe conclusion, \"Sam did not take a plane,\" is the negation of the antecedent in the first premise.\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. The structure of the argument is as follows:\nIf P, then Q\nNot Q\nTherefore, not P\n\nSince the argument follows a valid logical form, the conclusion \"Sam did not take a plane\" logically follows from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
