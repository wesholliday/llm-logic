            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\nPremise 2: The pants were not denim.\nConclusion: The shirt was not cotton.\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity of this argument, we can use the rules of propositional logic.\n\nThe first premise, \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the antecedent (the shirt was cotton) is true, then the consequent (the pants were denim) must also be true.\n\nThe second premise, \"The pants were not denim,\" contradicts the consequent of the first premise.\n\nThe conclusion, \"The shirt was not cotton,\" follows logically from the first two premises. If the pants were not denim, then the antecedent of the first premise (the shirt was cotton) must be false.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
