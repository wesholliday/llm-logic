            "content": "To determine if the given argument form is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\nPremise 2: Amy did not play tennis.\nConclusion: Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nLet's analyze the validity of this argument step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the consequent (Amy playing tennis) must also be true.\n\n2. The second premise states that Amy did not play tennis. This directly contradicts the consequent of the first premise.\n\n3. If the second premise is true (Amy did not play tennis), then the consequent of the first premise must be false. This means that the antecedent of the first premise (Jeff playing basketball) must also be false.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Jeff did not play basketball\" necessarily follows from the given premises. This argument form is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
