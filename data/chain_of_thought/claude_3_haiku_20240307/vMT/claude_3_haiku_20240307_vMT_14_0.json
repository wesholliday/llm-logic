            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe argument has the following structure:\nPremise 1: If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\nPremise 2: The wolf was not in the den.\nConclusion: The bear was not in the cave.\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity of this argument, we can use the rules of propositional logic.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q is \"the wolf was in the den\".\n\nThe second premise is the negation of the consequent of the first premise, which is \"not Q\" (the wolf was not in the den).\n\nThe conclusion is the negation of the antecedent of the first premise, which is \"not P\" (the bear was not in the cave).\n\nThis form of argument is known as the \"Modus Tollens\" rule of inference, which is a valid form of logical reasoning. The Modus Tollens rule states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and the negation of the consequent \"not Q\", then we can validly conclude the negation of the antecedent \"not P\".\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
