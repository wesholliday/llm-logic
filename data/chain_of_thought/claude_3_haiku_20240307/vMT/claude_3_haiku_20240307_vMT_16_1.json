This can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q represents \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nThe second premise states that the pants were not denim, which can be represented as \"not Q.\"\n\nThe conclusion states that the shirt was not cotton, which can be represented as \"not P.\"\n\nThe logical rule that applies here is called modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that \"not Q\" is true, then we can validly conclude that \"not P\" is also true.\n\nTherefore, the given argument form is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"

The Modus Tollens rule states that if we have a conditional statement (the first premise) and the negation of the consequent (the second premise), then we can validly conclude the negation of the antecedent (the conclusion).\n\nLogically, the argument is valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.
