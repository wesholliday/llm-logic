The structure of modus tollens is as follows:\nIf P, then Q.\nNot Q.\nTherefore, not P.\n\nIn the given argument, P represents \"the griffin was in the forest,\" and Q represents \"the unicorn was in the forest.\" The premises and the conclusion follow this valid logical structure.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
