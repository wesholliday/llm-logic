            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following structure:\nPremise 1: If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\nPremise 2: The book is not a mystery novel.\nConclusion: The book was not written by James.\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity of this argument, we can use the principle of modus tollens, which states that if the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, then the consequent must also be false.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" The second premise states that the book is not a mystery novel, which means the consequent of the first premise is false.\n\nAccording to the principle of modus tollens, if the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false. Therefore, the conclusion \"The book was not written by James\" follows logically from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
