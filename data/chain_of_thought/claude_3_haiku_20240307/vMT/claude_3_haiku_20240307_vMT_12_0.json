            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\nPremise 2: Lucy did not go to the zoo.\nConclusion: Joe did not go to the park.\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we can use the rules of propositional logic.\n\nThe first premise, \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo,\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the antecedent (Joe went to the park) is true, then the consequent (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true.\n\nThe second premise, \"Lucy did not go to the zoo,\" is the negation of the consequent in the first premise.\n\nUsing the rules of propositional logic, we can conclude that if the consequent is false (Lucy did not go to the zoo), then the antecedent must also be false (Joe did not go to the park).\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
