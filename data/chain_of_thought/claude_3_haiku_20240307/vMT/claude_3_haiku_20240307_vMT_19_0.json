If the first premise is true, then if Tom watched football, Jen must have watched basketball.\n2. However, the second premise states that Jen did not watch basketball.\n3. Therefore, the first premise must be false, and Tom did not watch football.\n\nSo, the conclusion \"Tom did not watch football\" follows necessarily from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
