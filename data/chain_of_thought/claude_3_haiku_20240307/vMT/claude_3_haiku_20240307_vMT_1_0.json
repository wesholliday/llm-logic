            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\nPremise 2: Sue was not at the wedding.\nConclusion: Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we can use the rules of propositional logic.\n\nThe first premise, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" is a conditional statement. This means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding as well.\n\nThe second premise, \"Sue was not at the wedding,\" is the negation of the consequent of the first premise.\n\nUsing the rule of modus tollens, which states that if the consequent of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent must also be false, we can conclude that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary must not have been at the wedding either.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
