            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\nPremise 2: The banana was not yellow.\nConclusion: The apple was not red.\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity of this argument, we can use the rules of propositional logic.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow\".\n\nThe second premise is the negation of the consequent of the first premise, which is \"the banana was not yellow\".\n\nThe conclusion is the negation of the antecedent of the first premise, which is \"the apple was not red\".\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. In modus tollens, if the conditional statement is true and the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
