The statement only suggests that the report could be accurate, but it does not make any claims about the timing of the report's submission.\n\nTo infer that the report \"might be accurate and be submitted by noon\" would require additional information that is not present in the original statement. The original statement does not mention anything about the report being submitted by a specific time, such as noon.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the original statement, we cannot infer that the report \"might be accurate and be submitted by noon.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
