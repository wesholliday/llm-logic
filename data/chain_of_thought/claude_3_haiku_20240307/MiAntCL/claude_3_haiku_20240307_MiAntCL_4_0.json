It only specifies the potential time of the meeting, but does not mention the location. Therefore, we cannot infer that the meeting \"might be at 2 PM and in the conference room\" from the given information. The statement about the location of the meeting is an additional piece of information that is not implied by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
