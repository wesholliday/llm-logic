            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The document might be signed and notarized' from 'The document might be signed', we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe statement 'The document might be signed' is a weaker, more general statement than 'The document might be signed and notarized'. This is because for a document to be signed and notarized, it must first be signed. However, a document can be signed without necessarily being notarized.\n\nTherefore, the statement 'The document might be signed' does not necessarily imply that the document is also notarized. It is possible for a document to be signed without being notarized.\n\nAnswer: no"
