It only suggests that the project might be completed by a certain date, Friday. The statement does not make any claims about the project being under budget.\n\nTo infer that the project might be completed by Friday and be under budget, we would need additional information that specifically mentions the project's budget or financial status. The given statement alone does not provide enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
