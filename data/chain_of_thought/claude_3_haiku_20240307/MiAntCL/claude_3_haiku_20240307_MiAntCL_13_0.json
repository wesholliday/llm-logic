The statement only suggests that the movie might be in the English language, but it does not provide any information about whether the movie will have subtitles or not.\n\nThe presence of subtitles is a separate piece of information that is not directly implied by the given statement. The movie could be in English without having subtitles, or it could have subtitles in addition to being in English.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from the statement \"The movie might be in English\" that the movie \"might be in English and have subtitles.\" The two pieces of information are not directly related in the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
