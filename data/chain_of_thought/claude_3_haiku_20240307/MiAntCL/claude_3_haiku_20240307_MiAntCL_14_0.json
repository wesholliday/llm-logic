The statement only indicates that the contract might be valid for a year, but it does not provide any information about whether the contract can be renewed or extended beyond that year.\n\nTo infer that the contract might be valid for a year and be renewable, we would need additional information or context that explicitly states or suggests the possibility of renewal or extension. The original statement alone does not provide enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
