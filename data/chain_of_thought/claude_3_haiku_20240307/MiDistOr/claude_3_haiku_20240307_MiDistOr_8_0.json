The key word here is \"or\", which indicates that these are two separate and mutually exclusive possibilities.\n\nThe statement \"The restaurant might be closed on Mondays or it might be open for limited hours\" is logically equivalent to the original statement. This is because the two statements are expressing the same two possibilities, just using slightly different wording.\n\nAnswer: yes"
