The statement does not imply that both possibilities are equally likely or that they are mutually exclusive.\n\nThe statement \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or it might be cancelled\" is also a disjunction, but it is more explicit in stating that both possibilities are equally likely. This statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, as it conveys the same information.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the statement \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or it might be cancelled\" can be derived from the original statement \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or be cancelled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
