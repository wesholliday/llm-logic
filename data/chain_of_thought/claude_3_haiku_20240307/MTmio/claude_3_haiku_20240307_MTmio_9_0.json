We are also given the statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\".\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n4. This is because the second statement says that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n5. Therefore, if Mark did not buy the blue shirt (as stated in the first statement), then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
