We are given the following premises:\n   - \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\"\n   - \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\"\n\n2. From the first premise, we can infer that it is possible that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\n3. The second premise tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding as well.\n\n4. Now, let's consider the contrapositive of the second premise: \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\n5. Since we know from the first premise that it is possible that Sue was not at the wedding, we can infer that it is possible that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
