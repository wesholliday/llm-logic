The first statement, \"The truck might not have been metal,\" suggests that the truck may or may not have been metal.\n2. The second statement, \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal,\" is a conditional statement. It means that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n3. However, the first statement contradicts the conclusion of the second statement, which is that the truck must have been metal. If the truck might not have been metal, then the condition \"if the doll was plastic\" cannot be true.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes"
