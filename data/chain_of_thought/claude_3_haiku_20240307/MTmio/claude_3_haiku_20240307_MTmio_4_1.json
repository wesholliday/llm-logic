This means that it's possible that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n5) If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the conditional statement \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter\" cannot be true.\n6) Therefore, we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes"

This statement does not provide any information about the alien's visit to Mars.\n\nThe second premise is 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the alien visited Mars) is true, then the consequent (the robot must have visited Jupiter) must also be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the contrapositive of this conditional statement. The contrapositive is 'If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars'. This is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement.\n\nGiven the first premise, 'The robot might not have visited Jupiter', we can infer that the contrapositive of the second premise is true. This means that 'The alien did not visit Mars'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
