The second premise tells us that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race as well.\n5. If Chris might not have finished the race, then it follows that Alex did not finish the race, because if Alex had finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race according to the second premise.\n\nAnswer: yes"
