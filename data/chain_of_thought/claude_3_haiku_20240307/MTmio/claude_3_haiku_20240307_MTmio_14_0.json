We are given the following premises:\n   - \"The wolf might not have been in the den\"\n   - \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den\"\n\n2. From the second premise, we can infer that if the wolf was not in the den, then the bear must not have been in the cave.\n\n3. Therefore, from the first premise (\"The wolf might not have been in the den\") and the inference from the second premise, we can conclude that \"The bear was not in the cave\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
