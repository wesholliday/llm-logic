The first premise is 'The banana might not have been yellow'. This statement does not provide any information about the color of the apple.\n\n2. The second premise is 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow'. This is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between the colors of the apple and the banana.\n\n3. The key question is whether we can infer that 'The apple was not red' from these two premises.\n\nTo do this, we need to consider the contrapositive of the second premise, which is 'If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red'.\n\n4. Since the first premise states that 'The banana might not have been yellow', we can conclude that the banana was not necessarily yellow.
