We are given the following two premises:\n   - \"The mummy might not have been awake\"\n   - \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake\"\n\n2. From the second premise, we can infer that if the mummy was not awake, then the vampire must not have been awake either.\n\n3. This is because the second premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake as well.\n\n4. Therefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The vampire was not awake\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
