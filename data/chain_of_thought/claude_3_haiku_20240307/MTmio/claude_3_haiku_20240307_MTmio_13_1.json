If the car was red, then the second premise states that the truck must have been blue. However, the first premise states that the truck might not have been blue. This means that the assumption 'the car was red' is contradictory to the first premise.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"

We are given the following two statements:\n   - \"The truck might not have been blue\"\n   - \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\"\n\n2. From the second statement, we can infer that if the car was not red, then the truck might not have been blue.

The first statement, \"The truck might not have been blue\", suggests that the truck was not necessarily blue.\n2. The second statement, \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\", implies that if the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n3. If the truck might not have been blue (from the first statement), then the condition \"If the car was red\" in the second statement cannot be true.\n4. If the condition \"If the car was red\" cannot be true, then the conclusion \"the truck must have been blue\" also cannot be true.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that \"The car was not red\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
