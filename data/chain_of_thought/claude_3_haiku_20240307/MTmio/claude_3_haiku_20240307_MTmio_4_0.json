We are given the following two premises:\n   - \"The robot might not have visited Jupiter\"\n   - \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter\"\n\n2. From the second premise, we can infer that if the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars. This is because the second premise states that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n\n3. Since the first premise states that \"The robot might not have visited Jupiter\", we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes"
