We are given the following two statements:\n   - \"Bob might not have chosen pasta\"\n   - \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\"\n\n2. From the second statement, we can infer that if Bob chose pasta, then Sue must have chosen pizza. This is because the statement says that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\n3. Now, the first statement says that \"Bob might not have chosen pasta\". This means that it's possible that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\n4. If Bob did not choose pasta, then according to the second statement, Sue must not have chosen pizza. This is because the second statement says that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"Sue did not choose pizza\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
