We are given the following premises:\n   - \"The truck might not have been metal\"\n   - \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\"\n\n2. The second premise is a conditional statement, which can be expressed as:\n   - If (the doll was plastic), then (the truck must have been metal)\n\n3. The first premise tells us that the truck \"might not have been metal\". This means that the truck might or might not have been metal.\n\n4. Now, let's consider the second premise. If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. However, the first premise tells us that the truck might not have been metal.\n\n5. Therefore, the only way for both premises to be true is if the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes"
