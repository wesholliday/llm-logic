We are given the following two premises:\n   - \"The cat might not have been outside\"\n   - \"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside\"\n\n2. From the second premise, we can infer that if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside. This means that if the cat was not outside, then the dog must not have been inside.\n\n3. Combining this with the first premise, \"The cat might not have been outside,\" we can conclude that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
