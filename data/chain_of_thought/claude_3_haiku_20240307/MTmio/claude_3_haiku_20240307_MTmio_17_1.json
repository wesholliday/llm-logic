We are given the premises:\n   - \"Kate might not have eaten salad\"\n   - \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad\"\n\n2. We want to determine if we can infer \"Ben did not eat pasta\" from these premises.\n\n3. The second premise, \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad\", is a conditional statement. It means that if the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the consequent (Kate must have eaten salad) is also true.\n\n4. The first premise, \"Kate might not have eaten salad\", suggests that it is possible that Kate did not eat salad.\n\n5. If Kate did not eat salad, then the consequent of the second premise (\"Kate must have eaten salad\") would be false. This means that the antecedent (\"Ben ate pasta\") must also be false, as the conditional statement cannot be true if the consequent is false.\n\n6. Therefore, we can infer that \"Ben did not eat pasta\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
