We are given the following two premises:\n   - \"The book might not be a mystery novel\"\n   - \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\"\n\n2. From the second premise, we can infer that if the book is not a mystery novel, then it was not written by James.\n\n3. The first premise tells us that \"The book might not be a mystery novel\", which means that it is possible that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\n4. Combining the two premises, we can infer that if the book is not a mystery novel, then it was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes"
