This means that it's possible that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\n2) The second premise is \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\". This means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\n3) We are asked if we can infer from these two premises that \"Sue did not choose pizza\".\n\n4) Let's consider the two possibilities:\n   a) If Sue chose pizza, then by the second premise, Bob must have chosen pasta. This contradicts the first premise that Bob might not have chosen pasta.\n   b) If Sue did not choose pizza, then the second premise does not apply, and there is no contradiction with the first premise.\n\n5) Therefore, the only way to resolve the contradiction is to conclude that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes"
