It means that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. However, it does not imply anything about whether Tom actually watched football or not.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot infer that \"Tom did not watch football.\" The second statement only tells us that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball, but it does not tell us whether Tom actually watched football or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
