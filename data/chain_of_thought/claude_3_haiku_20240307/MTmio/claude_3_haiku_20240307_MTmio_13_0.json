We are also given the statement \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\".\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that if the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\n4. This is because the second statement says that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. So, if the truck was not blue, then the car could not have been red.\n5. Therefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The car was not red\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
