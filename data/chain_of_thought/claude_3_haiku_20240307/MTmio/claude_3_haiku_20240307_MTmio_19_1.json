From the second premise, we can infer that if Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom must not have watched football. This is because the premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n\n3. Since the first premise tells us that \"Jen might not have watched basketball\", we can infer that it is possible that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\n4. Therefore, from the second premise, we can conclude that if Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\n\n5.
