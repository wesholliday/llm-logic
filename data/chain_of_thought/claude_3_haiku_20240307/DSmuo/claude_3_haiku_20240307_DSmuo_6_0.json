The first statement is \"It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen.\" This means that it is not necessary for the phone to be ringing in the kitchen.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen.\" This means that the phone is either in the living room or it is ringing in the kitchen.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the two possibilities:\n   a) If the phone is not ringing in the kitchen (as stated in the first statement), then it must be in the living room, according to the second statement.\n   b) If the phone is not in the living room, then it must be ringing in the kitchen, according to the second statement.\n\n4. Therefore, from the given information, we can infer that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes"
