The first premise is \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\" This means that the milk is not necessarily chilling in the fridge.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\" This means that the milk is either on the counter or it is chilling in the fridge.\n\n3. Combining the two premises, we can conclude that the milk is not chilling in the fridge. This leaves us with the option that the milk is on the counter.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes"
