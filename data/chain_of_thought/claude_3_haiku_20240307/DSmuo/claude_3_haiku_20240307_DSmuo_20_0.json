The first statement is \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\" This means that the sunglasses are not necessarily on her head.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\" This means that the sunglasses are either in her bag or on her head.\n\n3. Combining the two statements, we can conclude that the sunglasses are not on her head (from the first statement), and they must be in her bag (from the second statement).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
