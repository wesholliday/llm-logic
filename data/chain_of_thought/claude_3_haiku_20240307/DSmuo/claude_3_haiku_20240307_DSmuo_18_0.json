The first statement is \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\" This means that the notebook is not necessarily on the nightstand.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\" This means that the notebook is either in the drawer or on the nightstand.\n\n3. Combining the two statements, we can conclude that the notebook is not necessarily on the nightstand, and it is either in the drawer or on the nightstand.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
