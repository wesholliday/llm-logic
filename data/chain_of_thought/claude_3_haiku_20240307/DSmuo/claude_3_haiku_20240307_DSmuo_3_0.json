The first statement is \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\" This means that the keys are not necessarily dangling in the cabinet.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\" This means that the keys are either in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet.\n\n3. Combining the two statements, we can conclude that if the keys are not necessarily dangling in the cabinet, then they must be in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
