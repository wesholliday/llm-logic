The first premise is \"It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door.\" This means that the shoes do not have to be lined up by the door.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door.\" This means that the shoes are either in the closet or they must be lined up by the door.\n\n3. From the first premise, we know that the shoes do not have to be lined up by the door. This means that the only other possibility is that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes"
