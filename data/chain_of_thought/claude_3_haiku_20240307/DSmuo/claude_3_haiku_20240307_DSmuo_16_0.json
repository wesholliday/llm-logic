The first premise is \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\" This means that the pen is not necessarily on the desk.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk.\" This means that the pen is either in the bag or on the desk, but it cannot be anywhere else.\n\n3. From the first premise, we know that the pen is not necessarily on the desk. This means that the only other possibility is that the pen is in the bag.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
