            "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. The first premise states \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\" This means that the sunglasses are not necessarily on her head.\n\n2. The second premise states \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\" This means that the sunglasses are either in her bag or on her head.\n\n3. Combining the two premises, we can infer that if the sunglasses are not on her head, then they must be in her bag. This is because the only two options are that the sunglasses are either on her head or in her bag, and we know that they are not on her head.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"

The second premise is \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\" This means that the sunglasses can only be in one of two places: in her bag or perched on her head.\n\n3.
