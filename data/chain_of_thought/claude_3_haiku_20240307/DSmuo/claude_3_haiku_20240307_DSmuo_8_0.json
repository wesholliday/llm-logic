The first premise is \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\" This means that the remote control is not necessarily hiding under the couch.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\" This means that the remote control is either on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch.\n\n3. Given the first premise, we can conclude that the remote control is not necessarily hiding under the couch. This means that the only remaining possibility is that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
