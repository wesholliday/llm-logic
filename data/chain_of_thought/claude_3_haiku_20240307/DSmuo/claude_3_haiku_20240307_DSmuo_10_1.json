We are given two premises:\n   - \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\"\n   - \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed\"\n\n2. The first premise tells us that it is not necessary for the missing sock to be under the bed.\n\n3. The second premise gives us two possibilities for the location of the missing sock: either it is in the laundry basket, or it must be under the bed.\n\n4. Since the first premise tells us that the missing sock is not necessarily under the bed, the only remaining possibility from the second premise is that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes"
