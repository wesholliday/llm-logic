The first premise is \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.\" This means that it is not necessary for the cat to be playing in the bedroom.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom.\" This means that the cat is either napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom.\n\n3. Since the first premise states that it is not necessary for the cat to be playing in the bedroom, the only remaining possibility is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes"
