The first statement tells us that it is not necessary for the notebook to be sitting on the nightstand.\n2. The second statement presents two possibilities for the location of the notebook: either it is in the drawer, or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\n3. Since the first statement tells us that the notebook doesn't have to be on the nightstand, the only remaining possibility is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
