The first statement is \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\" This means that the cookies are not necessarily hidden in the pantry.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\" This means that the cookies are either in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry.\n\n3. Combining the two statements, we can conclude that the cookies are not necessarily hidden in the pantry, and they are either in the jar or hidden in the pantry.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes"
