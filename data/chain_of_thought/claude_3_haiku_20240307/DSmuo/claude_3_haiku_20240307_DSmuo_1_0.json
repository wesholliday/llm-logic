This means that it is not necessary for Fido to be in the garden.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\". This means that Fido is either inside or it is necessary for Fido to be in the garden.\n\n3. Now, if it is not necessary for Fido to be in the garden (from the first premise), and Fido must either be inside or in the garden (from the second premise), then the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
