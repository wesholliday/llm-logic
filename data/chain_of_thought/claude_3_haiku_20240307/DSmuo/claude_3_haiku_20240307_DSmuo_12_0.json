The first statement, \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet,\" means that the jacket is not necessarily hanging in the closet.\n\n2. The second statement, \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet,\" presents two possibilities: either the jacket is draped over the chair, or it must be hanging in the closet.\n\n3. Given the first statement, which says that the jacket is not necessarily hanging in the closet, the only remaining possibility is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes"
