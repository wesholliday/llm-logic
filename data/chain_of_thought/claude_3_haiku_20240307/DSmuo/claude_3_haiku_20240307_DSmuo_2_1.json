This statement does not provide any information about the location of the book.\n\nThe second statement, \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table,\" provides more information. This statement suggests that the book is either on the shelf or on the table. There are two possible scenarios: the book is on the shelf or the book is resting on the table.\n\nNow, considering the two statements together, we can make the following inferences:\n1. The book is not necessarily resting on the table (from the first statement).\n2. The book is either on the shelf or resting on the table (from the second statement).\n\nFrom these two inferences, we can conclude that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes"
