The first statement is \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\" This means that the toy is not necessarily on the bookshelf.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\" This means that the toy is either in the toy box or on the bookshelf.\n\n3. Combining the two statements, we can conclude that if the toy is not on the bookshelf, then it must be in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
