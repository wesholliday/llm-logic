The first premise is \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\" This means that the book is not necessarily on the table.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\" This means that the book is either on the shelf or on the table.\n\n3. Combining the two premises, we can conclude that the book is not on the table, as it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table. Therefore, the book must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes"
