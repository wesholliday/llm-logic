The first premise is \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\" This means that the umbrella is not necessarily in the closet.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet.\" This means that the umbrella is either in the car or in the closet.\n\n3. Combining the two premises, we can conclude that the umbrella is not in the closet, and it must be in the car.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
