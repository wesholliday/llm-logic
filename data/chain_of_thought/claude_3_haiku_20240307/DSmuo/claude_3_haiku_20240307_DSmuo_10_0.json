The first premise is \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\" This means that the missing sock is not necessarily under the bed.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed.\" This means that the missing sock is either in the laundry basket or under the bed, but not both.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the two possibilities:\n   a) If the missing sock is not under the bed (from the first premise), then it must be in the laundry basket (from the second premise).\n   b) If the missing sock is not in the laundry basket, then it must be under the bed (from the second premise), which contradicts the first premise.\n\nTherefore, the only possible conclusion is that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes"
