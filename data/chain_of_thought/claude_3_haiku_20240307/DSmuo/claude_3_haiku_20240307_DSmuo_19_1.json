The first premise states: \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\"\n   This means that the watch is not necessarily on his wrist.\n\n2. The second premise states: \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\"\n   This means that the watch is either charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist. It cannot be both.\n\n3. Combining the two premises, we can conclude that the watch is not on his wrist. This leaves us with two possibilities:\n   - The watch is charging on the dresser.\n   - The watch is not on his wrist and not charging on the dresser (but we don't have enough information to determine its location).\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes"
