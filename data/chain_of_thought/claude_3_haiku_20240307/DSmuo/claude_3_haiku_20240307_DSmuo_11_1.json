The first statement is \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch.\" This means that the newspaper is not necessarily sitting on the porch.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch.\" This means that the newspaper is either in the driveway or it must be on the porch.\n\n3. Combining these two statements, we can conclude that if the newspaper is not necessarily on the porch, and it must be either on the porch or in the driveway, then the newspaper must be in the driveway.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The newspaper is in the driveway.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"

From premise (a), we can infer that it is not necessarily the case that the newspaper is sitting on the porch. In other words, the newspaper may or may not be sitting on the porch.\n\n3.
