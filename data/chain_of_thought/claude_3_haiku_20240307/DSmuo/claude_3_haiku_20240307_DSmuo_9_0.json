The first premise is: \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\"\n   This means that the missing puzzle piece is not necessarily blending in on the floor.\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor.\"\n   This means that the missing puzzle piece is either in the box or it is blending in on the floor.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the two possibilities:\n   a) If the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor (from the first premise), then it must be in the box (from the second premise).\n   b) If the missing puzzle piece is not in the box, then it must be blending in on the floor (from the second premise).\n\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
