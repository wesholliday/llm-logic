The first premise is \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\" This means that the watch is not necessarily on his wrist.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\" This means that the watch is either charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist.\n\n3. From the first premise, we know that the watch is not necessarily on his wrist. This means that the only other possibility is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The watch is charging on the dresser.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
