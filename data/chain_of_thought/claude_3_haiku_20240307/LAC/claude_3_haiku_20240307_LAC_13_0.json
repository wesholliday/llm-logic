The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This means that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the truck was blue, then the car was red.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The truck was blue.\" This statement is consistent with the first statement, as it confirms that the truck was blue.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not provide enough information to logically infer that the car was red. The first statement only tells us that if the car was red, then the truck was blue, but it does not tell us that if the truck was blue, then the car was red.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically infer that \"The car was red.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
