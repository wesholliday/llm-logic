The question is asking whether we can logically infer 'The cake was chocolate' from these two statements.\n\nThe key to answering this question is to understand the logical relationship between the two statements. In a conditional statement, the truth of the consequent (the 'then' part) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (the 'if' part).\n\nIn other words, the fact that the muffins were blueberry (the consequent) does not logically imply that the cake was chocolate (the antecedent). There could be other possible reasons for the muffins being blueberry.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer 'The cake was chocolate' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
