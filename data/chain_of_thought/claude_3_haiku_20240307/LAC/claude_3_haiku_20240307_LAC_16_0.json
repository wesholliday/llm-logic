The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\n2. The second statement is a categorical statement: \"The pants were denim.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the logical inference:\n- The first statement tells us that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n- The second statement tells us that the pants were denim.\n- From this, we can conclude that the condition in the first statement is true (the pants were denim), but we cannot logically infer the truth of the antecedent (the shirt was cotton).\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer 'The shirt was cotton' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
