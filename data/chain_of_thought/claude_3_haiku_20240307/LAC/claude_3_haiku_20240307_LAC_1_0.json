The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. However, this does not necessarily mean that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was also at the wedding.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that Sue was present at the wedding.\n\nFrom the given information, we can conclude that Sue was at the wedding, but we cannot logically infer that Mary was at the wedding. The first statement only tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding, but it does not provide any information about Mary's presence at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no"
