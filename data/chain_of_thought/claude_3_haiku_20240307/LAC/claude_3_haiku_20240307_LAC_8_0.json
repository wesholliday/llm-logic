The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This means that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake, but it does not necessarily mean that if the mummy was awake, the vampire was also awake.\n\n2. The second statement is a categorical statement: \"The mummy was awake.\" This means that the mummy was indeed awake.\n\n3. From the first statement, we know that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. Since the second statement tells us that the mummy was awake, we can infer that the condition in the first statement (the vampire being awake) must have been true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can logically infer that 'The vampire was awake.'\n\nAnswer: yes"
