This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the apple was red) is true, then the consequent (the banana was yellow) must also be true.\n\nThe second premise is 'The banana was yellow'. This is a statement about the actual state of the banana.\n\nNow, the question is whether we can infer the truth of the antecedent (the apple was red) from the truth of the consequent (the banana was yellow) and the conditional statement.\n\nThe logical rule that applies here is called modus ponens. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (If A, then B) and the antecedent (A) is true, then we can infer that the consequent (B) is also true.\n\nHowever, in this case, we do not have the truth of the antecedent (the apple was red). Instead, we have the truth of the consequent (the banana was yellow). This means that we cannot apply the modus ponens rule to infer the truth of the antecedent.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we cannot logically infer 'The apple was red'.\n\nAnswer: no"
