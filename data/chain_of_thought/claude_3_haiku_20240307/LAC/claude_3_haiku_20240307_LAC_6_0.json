The first statement is \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition \"Sue chose pizza\" is true, then the consequence \"Bob chose pasta\" is also true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Bob chose pasta.\" This is a direct statement about Bob's choice.\n\n3. Now, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nIf the first statement is true (i.e., \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\") and the second statement is also true (i.e., \"Bob chose pasta\"), then we can logically infer that the condition in the first statement must also be true, which is \"Sue chose pizza.\"\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can logically infer that \"Sue chose pizza.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
