The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This means that if Sam took a plane, then it necessarily follows that Erin took a train.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Erin took a train.\" This means that Erin did, in fact, take a train.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical inference:\n- The first statement tells us that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n- The second statement tells us that Erin did take a train.\n- However, the information given does not allow us to infer that Sam took a plane. The first statement only tells us that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train, but it does not tell us whether Sam actually took a plane or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer 'Sam took a plane' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
