The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This means that if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"The cat was outside.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the logical inference:\n\nIf the first statement is true (\"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\") and the second statement is also true (\"The cat was outside\"), can we logically infer that \"The dog was inside\"?\n\nThe answer is no. From the given information, we can only infer that if the cat was outside, then the dog must have been inside (according to the first statement). However, we cannot logically infer the opposite, that is, that the dog was inside just because the cat was outside.\n\nAnswer: no"
