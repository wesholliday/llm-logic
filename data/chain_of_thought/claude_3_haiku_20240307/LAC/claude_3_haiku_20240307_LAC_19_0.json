The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This means that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball, but it does not necessarily mean that if Jen watched basketball, then Tom must have watched football.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Jen watched basketball.\" This statement is consistent with the first statement, as it confirms that Jen watched basketball.\n\nHowever, the first statement does not provide enough information to infer that Tom watched football. The first statement only tells us that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball, but it does not tell us whether Tom actually watched football or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically infer that \"Tom watched football.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
