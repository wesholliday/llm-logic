The question is asking whether we can logically infer 'Lisa bought the red shirt' from these two premises.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n- The first premise is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q.\" This means that if P (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then Q (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true.\n- The second premise tells us that Q (Mark bought the blue shirt) is true.\n- However, the first premise does not tell us whether P (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true or not. It only tells us that if P is true, then Q must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we cannot logically infer that 'Lisa bought the red shirt.'
