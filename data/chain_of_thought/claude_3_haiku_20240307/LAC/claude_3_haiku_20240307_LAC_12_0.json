The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This means that if the antecedent (Joe went to the park) is true, then the consequent (Lucy went to the zoo) is also true.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" This means that the consequent of the first statement is true.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical inference:\n* If the consequent of a conditional statement is true, and we know the conditional statement is true, then we can infer that the antecedent is also true.\n* In this case, the consequent \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is true, and the conditional statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is true.\n* Therefore, we can logically infer that the antecedent \"Joe went to the park\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
