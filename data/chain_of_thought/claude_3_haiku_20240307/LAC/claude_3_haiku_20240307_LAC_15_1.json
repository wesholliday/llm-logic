Erin took a train.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that Erin did indeed take a train. \n\nNow, let's consider the first statement. It is a conditional statement that says \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This means that if the premise \"Sam took a plane\" is true, then the conclusion \"Erin took a train\" must also be true.\n\nHowever, the given information does not tell us whether the premise \"Sam took a plane\" is true or not.
