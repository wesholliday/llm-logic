The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This means that if the condition \"Jeff played basketball\" is true, then the consequence \"Amy played tennis\" is also true.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Amy played tennis.\" This means that the consequence \"Amy played tennis\" is true.\n\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer the condition \"Jeff played basketball\" from the given information.\n\nThe rules of logical inference state that if we have a conditional statement (the first statement) and the consequence of that statement is true (the second statement), then we can infer the condition is also true.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can logically infer that \"Jeff played basketball.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
