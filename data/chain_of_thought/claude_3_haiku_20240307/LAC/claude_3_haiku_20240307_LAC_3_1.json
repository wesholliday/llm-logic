We are given the following two statements:\n   - If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n   - The book is a mystery novel.\n\n2. From the first statement, we can see that if the book was written by James, then it would be a mystery novel. This means that the book being a mystery novel is a necessary condition for the book being written by James.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that the book is a mystery novel. This satisfies the necessary condition from the first statement.\n\n4. However, the fact that the book is a mystery novel does not necessarily mean that it was written by James. There could be other authors who have written mystery novels as well.\n\n5. Therefore, from the given information, we cannot logically infer that \"The book was written by James.\" The information provided is not sufficient to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
