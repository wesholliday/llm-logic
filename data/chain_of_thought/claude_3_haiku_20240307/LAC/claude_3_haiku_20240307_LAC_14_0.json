The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\"\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"The wolf was in the den.\"\n3. From the conditional statement, we can infer that if the wolf was in the den, then the bear must have been in the cave.\n4. However, the second statement only tells us that the wolf was in the den, but it does not provide any information about the location of the bear.\n5. Therefore, we cannot logically infer 'The bear was in the cave' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
