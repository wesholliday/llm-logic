The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This means that if the condition \"Ben ate pasta\" is true, then the consequence \"Kate ate salad\" is also true.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Kate ate salad.\" This means that the consequence \"Kate ate salad\" is true.\n\n3. Now, we need to consider the logical relationship between the conditional statement and the simple statement. If the consequence of the conditional statement is true (Kate ate salad), then we can infer that the condition of the conditional statement is also true (Ben ate pasta).\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can logically infer that \"Ben ate pasta.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
