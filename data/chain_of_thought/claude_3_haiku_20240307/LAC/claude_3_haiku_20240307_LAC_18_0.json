The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n2. The second statement is a categorical statement: \"The truck was metal.\"\n3. From the conditional statement, we can infer that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic. This is because the conditional statement is a biconditional statement, meaning that the two parts are logically equivalent.\n4. However, the second statement only tells us that the truck was metal, but it does not provide any information about the doll being plastic.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically infer that \"The doll was plastic.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
