The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then it necessarily follows that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This means that Mark did, in fact, buy the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical inference:\n* If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt (from the first statement)\n* Mark did buy the blue shirt (from the second statement)\n* Therefore, we can logically infer that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
