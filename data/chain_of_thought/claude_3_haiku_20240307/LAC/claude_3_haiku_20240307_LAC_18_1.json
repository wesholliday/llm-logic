However, the converse of this statement (if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic) does not necessarily hold true.\n\nThe second premise is \"The truck was metal.\" This statement is consistent with the first premise, as it confirms that the truck was metal.\n\nNow, the question is whether we can logically infer 'The doll was plastic' from these two premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. Since the second premise confirms that the truck was metal, we can infer that the doll was plastic. However, this inference is not guaranteed to be true, as the first premise only states a sufficient condition, not a necessary condition.\n\nIn other words, the fact that the truck was metal does not necessarily mean that the doll was plastic.
