The first statement is \"Either the pen is on my desk or it is in my bag.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two possibilities must be true, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The pen isn't on my desk.\" This means that the first part of the disjunction, \"the pen is on my desk,\" is false.\n\n3. Since the first part of the disjunction is false, the second part, \"the pen is in my bag,\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The pen is in my bag.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
