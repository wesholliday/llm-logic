The first statement is \"Either the phone is ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen.\" This means that the first part of the disjunction is false, so the second part must be true.\n\n3. Therefore, we can infer that \"The phone is in the living room.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
