This means that either one of the two possibilities is true, but not both.\n\n2. The statement \"The shoes aren't lined up by the door\" is the negation of one of the possibilities in the disjunctive statement.\n\n3. Since the shoes aren't lined up by the door, the only remaining possibility from the disjunctive statement is that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes"
