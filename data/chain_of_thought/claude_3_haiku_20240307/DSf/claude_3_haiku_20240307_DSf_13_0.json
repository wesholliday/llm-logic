The first statement is \"Either the toy is sitting on the shelf or it is in the toy box.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf.\" This means that the first part of the disjunction is false.\n\n3. Since the first part of the disjunction is false, the second part must be true. In other words, if the toy is not sitting on the shelf, then it must be in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
