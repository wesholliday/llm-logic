This means that Fido's location is limited to either being in the garden or being inside.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Fido is not in the garden\". This means that Fido cannot be in the garden.\n\n3. Given the first premise that Fido's location is limited to either being in the garden or being inside, and the second premise that Fido is not in the garden, the only remaining possibility is that Fido must be inside.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that \"Fido is inside\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
