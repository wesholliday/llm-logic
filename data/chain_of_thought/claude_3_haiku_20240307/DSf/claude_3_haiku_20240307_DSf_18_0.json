The first statement is \"Either the notebook is sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer.\" This means that the notebook is either on the nightstand or in the drawer, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand.\" This means that the notebook is not on the nightstand.\n\n3. Given the first statement, if the notebook is not on the nightstand, then it must be in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The notebook is in the drawer.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
