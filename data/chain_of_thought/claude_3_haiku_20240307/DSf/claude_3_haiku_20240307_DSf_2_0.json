The first statement is \"Either the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf.\" This is an \"either-or\" statement, which means that the book must be in one of the two locations, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The book isn't resting on the table.\" This means that the book is not on the table.\n\n3. Given the first statement, if the book is not on the table, then it must be on the shelf. This is the only other possible location for the book.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
