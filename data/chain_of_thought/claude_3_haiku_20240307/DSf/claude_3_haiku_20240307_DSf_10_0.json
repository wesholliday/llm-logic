The initial statement is \"Either the missing sock is under the bed or it's in the laundry basket.\"\n2. This is an \"either-or\" statement, which means that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n3. The second statement is \"The missing sock isn't under the bed.\"\n4. This means that the first possibility, \"the missing sock is under the bed,\" is false.\n5. Since the initial statement is an \"either-or\" statement, and the first possibility is false, the second possibility must be true.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that \"The missing sock is in the laundry basket.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
