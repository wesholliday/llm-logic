The first statement is \"Either the shoes are lined up by the door or they are in the closet.\" This is a disjunctive statement, meaning that one of the two possibilities must be true, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The shoes aren't lined up by the door.\" This means that the first part of the disjunction is false.\n\n3. Since the first part of the disjunction is false, the second part must be true. In other words, if the shoes are not lined up by the door, then they must be in the closet.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The shoes are in the closet.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
