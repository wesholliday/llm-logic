The first statement is \"Either the sunglasses are perched on her head or they are in her bag.\" This is an \"either-or\" statement, meaning that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The sunglasses aren't perched on her head.\" This means that the first possibility in the \"either-or\" statement is not true.\n\n3. Since the first possibility is not true, the only remaining possibility from the \"either-or\" statement must be true. In other words, if the sunglasses are not on her head, then they must be in her bag.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
