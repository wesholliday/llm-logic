The first statement is \"Either the cat is playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch.\" This is an \"either-or\" statement, which means that one of the two possibilities must be true, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The cat isn't playing in the bedroom.\" This means that the first part of the \"either-or\" statement is false, which leaves the second part as the only possible option.\n\n3. Therefore, we can infer that \"The cat is napping on the couch.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
