This is an \"either-or\" statement, meaning that one of the two options must be true.\n\n2) The second statement is \"The newspaper isn't sitting on the porch\". This means that the first option in the \"either-or\" statement is false.\n\n3) Since the first option is false, the second option must be true. In other words, if the newspaper is not on the porch, then it must be in the driveway.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"

The first statement is \"Either the newspaper is sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway.\" This is a disjunctive statement, which means that one of the two possibilities must be true, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The newspaper isn't sitting on the porch.\" This means that the first possibility in the disjunctive statement is not true.\n\n3. Since the first possibility (the newspaper is sitting on the porch) is not true, and the statement is disjunctive, the only remaining possibility must be true.

This is a disjunctive statement, which means that one of the two options must be true, but they cannot both be true simultaneously.\n\n2.
