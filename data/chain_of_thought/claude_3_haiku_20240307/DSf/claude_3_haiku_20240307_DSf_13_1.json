            "content": "To answer this, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"Either the toy is sitting on the shelf or it is in the toy box.\" This means that the toy can be in one of two locations: on the shelf or in the toy box.\n2. The second premise is \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf.\" This means that the toy is not on the shelf.\n3. Given the first premise and the second premise, we can logically infer that the toy must be in the toy box. Since the toy is not on the shelf, and it can only be in one of two locations (on the shelf or in the toy box), the only remaining possibility is that it is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
