The first statement is \"Either the remote control is hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\" This means that the first possibility in the disjunction is false.\n\n3. Since the first possibility is false, the second possibility must be true. In other words, if the remote control is not under the couch, then it must be on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
