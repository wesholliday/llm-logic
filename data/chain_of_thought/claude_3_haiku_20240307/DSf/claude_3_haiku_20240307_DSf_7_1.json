The first statement is a disjunction: \"Either the umbrella is tucked away in the closet or it is in the car.\" This means that the umbrella is either in the closet or in the car, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is the negation of the first part of the disjunction: \"The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet.\" This means that the umbrella is not in the closet.\n\n3. Given the first statement and the negation of the first part of the disjunction, we can logically infer that the umbrella must be in the car.
