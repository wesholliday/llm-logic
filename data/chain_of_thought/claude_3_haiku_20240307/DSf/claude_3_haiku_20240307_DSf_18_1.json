The first statement is a disjunction, which means that either the notebook is sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer. This can be represented as: (Nightstand \u2228 Drawer).\n\n2. The second statement is a negation, which means that the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand. This can be represented as: \u00acNightstand.\n\n3.
