The first statement is \"Either the milk is chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter.\" This is an \"either-or\" statement, which means that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The milk isn't chilling in the fridge.\" This means that the first part of the \"either-or\" statement is false.\n\n3. Since the first part of the \"either-or\" statement is false, the second part must be true. In other words, if the milk is not in the fridge, then it must be on the counter.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
