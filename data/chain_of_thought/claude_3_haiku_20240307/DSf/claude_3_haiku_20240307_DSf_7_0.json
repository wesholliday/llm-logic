The first statement is \"Either the umbrella is tucked away in the closet or it is in the car.\" This is an \"either-or\" statement, which means that the umbrella must be in one of those two locations, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet.\" This means that the umbrella is not in the closet.\n\n3. Given the first statement, if the umbrella is not in the closet, then it must be in the car. This is the only other possible location for the umbrella based on the first statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that \"The umbrella is in the car.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
