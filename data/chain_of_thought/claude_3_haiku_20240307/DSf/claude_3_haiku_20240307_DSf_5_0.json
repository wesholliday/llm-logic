The initial statement is: \"Either the cookies are hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar.\"\n2. This means that the cookies must be in one of these two locations: the pantry or the jar.\n3. The second statement is: \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry.\"\n4. This means that the cookies cannot be in the pantry, as they are not hidden there.\n5. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes"
