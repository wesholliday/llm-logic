The first statement is \"Either the jacket is hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair.\" This is an \"either-or\" statement, which means that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The jacket isn't hanging in the closet.\" This means that the first possibility in the \"either-or\" statement is false.\n\n3. Since the first possibility is false, the second possibility must be true. In other words, if the jacket is not hanging in the closet, then it must be draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The jacket is draped over the chair.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
