The first statement is \"Either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\" This is an \"either-or\" statement, which means that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet.\" This means that the first part of the \"either-or\" statement is false.\n\n3. Since the first part of the \"either-or\" statement is false, the second part must be true. In other words, if the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, then they must be in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
