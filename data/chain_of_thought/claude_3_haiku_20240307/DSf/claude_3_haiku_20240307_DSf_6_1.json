The first statement is \"Either the phone is ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room.\" This means that the phone is either in the kitchen and ringing, or it is in the living room.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen.\" This means that the phone is not in the kitchen and ringing.\n\n3.

The second statement is \"The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen.\" This means that the first part of the disjunction, \"the phone is ringing in the kitchen,\" is false.\n\n3.

The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen.\n\nWe can use the rule of disjunctive syllogism to infer the conclusion.\n\nThe rule of disjunctive syllogism states that if we have a disjunction (either-or statement) and we can negate one of the disjuncts, then we can infer the other disjunct.\n\nIn this case, the disjunction is \"Either the phone is ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room.\" We are given that the phone isn't ringing in the kitchen, which negates the first disjunct.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes"
