This means that one of the two options must be true, but not both.\n\nThe second statement, \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet,\" is the negation of the first part of the disjunction.\n\nSince the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, the only remaining option from the disjunction is that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"

The second premise, 'The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet,' is the negation of one of the disjuncts.\n\nUsing the principle of disjunction elimination, if one disjunct is false, the other disjunct must be true.
