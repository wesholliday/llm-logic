We are given the statement: \"Either the cookies are hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar.\"\n2. We are also given the statement: \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry.\"\n3. The first statement is a disjunction, which means that either one of the two possibilities is true, but not both.\n4. The second statement tells us that the first part of the disjunction is false, that is, the cookies are not hidden in the pantry.\n5. Therefore, the second part of the disjunction must be true, which means that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes"

The second statement is: \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry.\"\n3. The question is whether we can infer from these two statements that \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\nLet's consider the logic:\n- The first statement gives us two possibilities: the cookies are either in the pantry or in the jar.\n- The second statement eliminates the first possibility, that the cookies are in the pantry.\n- Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes"

Either the cookies are hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar.\n2. The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry.\n\nFrom this information, we can make the following logical inference:\n\nIf the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, then they must be in the jar.\n\nThis is because the first statement gives us two possible locations for the cookies: the pantry or the jar. The second statement then eliminates one of those possibilities (the pantry), leaving us with only the other possibility (the jar).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes"
