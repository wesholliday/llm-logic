The first statement is \"Either the watch is on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser.\" This means that the watch can only be in one of two places: on his wrist or charging on the dresser.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The watch isn't on his wrist.\" This means that the watch is not on his wrist.\n\n3. Since the watch can only be in one of two places (on his wrist or charging on the dresser), and we know it's not on his wrist, the only remaining possibility is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The watch is charging on the dresser.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
