The first premise states: 'Either the cat is playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch.' This means that the cat's behavior is limited to these two possibilities.\n2. The second premise states: 'The cat isn't playing in the bedroom.' This eliminates the first possibility from the first premise.\n3. Since the first premise states that the cat's behavior is limited to these two possibilities, and the second premise eliminates the first possibility, we can logically infer that the remaining possibility must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
