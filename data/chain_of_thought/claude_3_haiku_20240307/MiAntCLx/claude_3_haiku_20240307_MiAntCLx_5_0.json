The original statement only suggests that \"the wobble might be wump bimboozle\", but it does not indicate that there is any additional information or that the \"wump\" is also \"for\" something. Without any further context or details, we cannot logically conclude that the original statement implies the additional information provided in the second statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
