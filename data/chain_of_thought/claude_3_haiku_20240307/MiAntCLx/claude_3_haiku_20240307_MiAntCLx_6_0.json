The original statement only makes a claim about the plimp being \"blurble quank\", but does not mention anything about it being \"zibble at zibber zibber\". Without any additional information, we cannot infer that the plimp might be \"blurble quank and zibble at zibber zibber\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
