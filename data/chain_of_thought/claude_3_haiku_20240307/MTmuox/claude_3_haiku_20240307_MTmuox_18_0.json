We are also given the statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged.\"\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that if the shank was not nugged, then it was not plooked.\n4. This is because the second statement says that if the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged. The contrapositive of this statement is that if the shank was not nugged, then it was not plooked.\n5. Therefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The shank was not plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
