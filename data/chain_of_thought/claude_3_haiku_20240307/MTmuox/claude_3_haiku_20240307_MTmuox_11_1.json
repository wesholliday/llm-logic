The second premise is \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed.\" This means that if the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed.\n\n3. Now, we need to consider the contrapositive of the second premise, which is: \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\" This is because if the flug was not zimmed, then the condition for it to have been zimmed is not met, and therefore, it must not have been blummed.\n\n4.
