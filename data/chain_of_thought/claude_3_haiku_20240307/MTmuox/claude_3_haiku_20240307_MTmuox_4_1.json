The first premise is \"It's not the case that the fribble must have crinked.\" This means that it is not necessary for the fribble to have crinked.\n\n2. The second premise is \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked.\" This means that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the contrapositive of the second premise: \"If the fribble did not crinck, then the fribble was not snurgled.\" This is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. Since the first premise tells us that it's not the case that the fribble must have crinked, we can infer that the fribble did not crinck.\n\n5. Applying the contrapositive of the second premise, we can then conclude that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
