We are given the following two premises:\n   - \"It's not the case that the splat must have quanked\"\n   - \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked\"\n\n2. From the second premise, we can infer that if the splat was not morphed, then the splat must not have quanked. This is because the premise states that if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked. The contrapositive of this statement is that if the splat did not quank, then it must not have been morphed.\n\n3. Now, the first premise tells us that \"It's not the case that the splat must have quanked\". This means that the splat did not quank.\n\n4. Combining the conclusions from steps 2 and 3, we can infer that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
