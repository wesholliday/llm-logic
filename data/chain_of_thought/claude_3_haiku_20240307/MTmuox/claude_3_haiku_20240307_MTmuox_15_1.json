However, the second statement tells us that if the dreb was vroombed, then it must have been spened.\n\nIf the dreb was not spened (as per the first statement), then it must not have been vroombed, as the second statement indicates that the dreb being vroombed would have resulted in it being spened.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
