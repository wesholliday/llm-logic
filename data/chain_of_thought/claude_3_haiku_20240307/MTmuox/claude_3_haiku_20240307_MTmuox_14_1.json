This means that the clug was not necessarily snugged.\n\n2. The second premise is \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged\". This means that if the clug was fleeked, then it must have been snugged.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the contrapositive of the second premise: \"If the clug was not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked\". This is logically equivalent to the original second premise.\n\n4. Combining the first premise (\"It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged\") with the contrapositive of the second premise (\"If the clug was not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked\"), we can infer that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
