This means that it is not necessary for the zinger to have been smoogled.\n\n2) We are also given the statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled\". This means that if the zinger was fraggled, then it must have been smoogled.\n\n3) From these two statements, we can infer that if the zinger was not smoogled, then it must not have been fraggled. In other words, \"The zinger was not fraggled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
