We are also given the statement \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged\".\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that if the clug was not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked.\n4. This is because the second statement says that if the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged. The contrapositive of this statement is that if the clug was not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked.\n5. Therefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The clug was not fleeked\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
