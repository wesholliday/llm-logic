We are given the statement \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been varnished.\" This means that it is not necessarily true that the twonk was varnished.\n\n2. We are also given the statement \"If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished.\" This means that if the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\n\n3. From these two statements, we can infer that if the twonk was not varnished, then it was not plinked. This is because the second statement tells us that the only way for the twonk to have been varnished is if it was plinked.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
