We have the statement: \"It's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled.\"\n   This means that it is not necessary for the flugel to have been zargled.\n\n2. We also have the statement: \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled.\"\n   This means that if the flugel was blimmed, then it must have been zargled.\n\n3. The question is asking whether we can infer that \"The flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nTo answer this, we need to consider the contrapositive of the second statement. The contrapositive is: \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\n4. Since we know from the first statement that it is not the case that the flugel must have been zargled, we can infer that the flugel was not zargled.\n\n5.
