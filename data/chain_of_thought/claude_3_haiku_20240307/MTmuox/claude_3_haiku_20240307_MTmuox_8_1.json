The first premise is: \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled.\" This means that it is not necessarily true that the sprocket was daggled.\n\n2. The second premise is: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled.\" This means that if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the contrapositive of the second premise: \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\" This is logically equivalent to the original second premise.\n\n4. Given the first premise, \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled,\" we can infer that the sprocket was not daggled.\n\n5.
