This means that it is not necessary for the smip to have lupped the zoint.\n2) The second premise is \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint\". This means that if the smip was shripped, then it must have lupped the zoint.\n3) From the two premises, we can infer that if the smip did not lup the zoint, then it must not have been shripped. In other words, the smip was not shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes"
