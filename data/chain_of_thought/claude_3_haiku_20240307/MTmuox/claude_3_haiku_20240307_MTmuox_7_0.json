We are given the following premises:\n   - \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have tinked\"\n   - \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked\"\n\n2. The first premise tells us that it is not necessary for the whiffle to have tinked.\n\n3. The second premise tells us that if the whiffle was shanked, then it must have tinked.\n\n4. Now, let's consider the contrapositive of the second premise: \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\n5. Since the first premise tells us that it is not necessary for the whiffle to have tinked, we can infer that the whiffle did not tink.\n\n6. Therefore, using the contrapositive of the second premise, we can infer that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
