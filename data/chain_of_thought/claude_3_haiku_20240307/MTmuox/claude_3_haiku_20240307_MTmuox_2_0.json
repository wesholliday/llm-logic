This means that it is not necessarily true that the wug bimmed the zoint.\n\n2) The second premise is \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint\". This means that if the wug was flooped, then it must have bimmed the zoint.\n\n3) From these two premises, we can infer that if the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug must not have been flooped. \n\n4) In other words, the negation of the first premise (\"It's not the case that the wug must have bimmed the zoint\") implies the negation of the second premise (\"The wug was not flooped\").\n\nAnswer: yes"
