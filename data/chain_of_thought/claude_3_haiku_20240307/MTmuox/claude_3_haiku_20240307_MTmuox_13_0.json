We are given the following premises:\n   - \"It's not the case that the glip must have tragged\"\n   - \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged\"\n\n2. From the second premise, we can infer that if the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged.\n\n3. The first premise tells us that it's not the case that the glip must have tragged.\n\n4. If the glip must have tragged when it was slogged, but it's not the case that the glip must have tragged, then we can infer that the glip was not slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
