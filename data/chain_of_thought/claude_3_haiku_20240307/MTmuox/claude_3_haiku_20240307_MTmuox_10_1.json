We are given two premises:\n   a) \"It's not the case that the wug must have been garpled\"\n   b) \"If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled\"\n\n2. From premise (b), we can infer that if the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged. This is because the premise states that if the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled.\n\n3. Premise (a) states that \"It's not the case that the wug must have been garpled\". This means that the wug was not necessarily garpled.\n\n4. Combining the inferences from steps (2) and (3), we can conclude that if the wug was not necessarily garpled, then it was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
