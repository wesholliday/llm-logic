We are given the statement: \"It's not the case that the wug must have been garpled.\"\n   This means that it is not necessary for the wug to have been garpled.\n\n2. We are also given the statement: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled.\"\n   This means that if the wug was sproinged, then it was necessarily garpled.\n\n3. From these two statements, we can infer that if the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged.\n   This is because the second statement tells us that if the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled. Therefore, if the wug was not garpled, it could not have been sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
