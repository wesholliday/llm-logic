This is because the statement says that if the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged.\n\nTherefore, if the shank must not have been nugged (as stated in the first statement), then it follows that the shank was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes"

If the shank was not plooked, then the second statement does not apply, and we cannot infer anything about whether the shank was nugged or not.\n2. If the shank was plooked, then the second statement tells us that the shank must have been nugged. However, the first statement tells us that it's not the case that the shank must have been nugged.
