This means that if the smip was shripped, then it must have lupped the zoint.\n\n3) The question asks if we can infer from these two premises that \"The smip was not shripped\".\n\n4) The key here is that the first premise tells us that it is not necessarily true that the smip lupped the zoint.

In other words, the smip may or may not have lupped the zoint.\n\nThe second statement tells us that if the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint. This means that the condition of the smip being shripped implies that the smip lupped the zoint.\n\nNow, let's consider the inference \"The smip was not shripped\". To arrive at this conclusion, we need to negate the condition in the second statement, which means that if the smip was not shripped, then the smip did not lupp the zoint.\n\nIf the smip did not lupp the zoint, then the first statement (\"It's not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint\") is true.
