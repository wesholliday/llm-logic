This means that the dreb does not necessarily have to be spened.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened\". This means that the dreb is either vroombed or it must be spened.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the two possibilities:\n   a) If the dreb is not spened (from the first statement), then it must be vroombed (from the second statement).\n   b) If the dreb must be spened (from the second statement), then it cannot be vroombed.\n\n4. Therefore, from the given information, we can infer that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
