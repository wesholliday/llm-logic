The first premise is 'It's not the case that the shank must be nugged'. This means that the shank does not necessarily have to be nugged.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged'. This means that the shank is either plooked or it must be nugged.\n\n3. Since the first premise states that the shank does not necessarily have to be nugged, the only remaining possibility is that the shank is plooked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer 'The shank is plooked'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
