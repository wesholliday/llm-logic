The first premise is 'It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked'. This means that the whiffle is not necessarily tinked.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked'. This means that the whiffle is either shanked or it must be tinked.\n\n3. Combining the two premises, we can conclude that the whiffle is not necessarily tinked, but it is either shanked or must be tinked.\n\n4. Since the whiffle is either shanked or must be tinked, and it is not the case that it must be tinked, the only remaining possibility is that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that 'The whiffle is shanked'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
