We are given the following premises:\n   - \"It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled\"\n   - \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled\"\n\n2. The first premise tells us that it is not necessary for the sprocket to be daggled.\n\n3. The second premise gives us two possibilities: either the sprocket is cranked, or it must be daggled.\n\n4. Since the first premise tells us that the sprocket does not have to be daggled, the only remaining possibility is that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
