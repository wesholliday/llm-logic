The first premise states: \"It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed.\" This means that the flug is not necessarily zimmed.\n\n2. The second premise states: \"Either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed.\" This means that the flug is either blummed or zimmed.\n\n3. Combining the two premises, we can conclude that the flug is not necessarily zimmed, but it is either blummed or zimmed.\n\n4. Since the flug is either blummed or zimmed, and it is not necessarily zimmed, the only remaining possibility is that the flug is blummed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that 'The flug is blummed'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
