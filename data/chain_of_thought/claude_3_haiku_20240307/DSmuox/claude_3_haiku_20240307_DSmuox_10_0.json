The first premise is 'It's not the case that the wug must be garpled'. This means that it is not necessary for the wug to be garpled.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled'. This means that the wug is either sproinged or it must be garpled.\n\n3. Since it is not necessary for the wug to be garpled (from the first premise), the only remaining possibility is that the wug is sproinged.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer 'The wug is sproinged'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
