The first premise is 'It's not the case that the flob must be movated'. This means that the flob is not necessarily movated.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated'. This means that the flob is either skizzled or movated.\n\n3. Combining the two premises, we can conclude that if the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled. This is because the second premise states that the flob is either skizzled or movated, and the first premise tells us that it is not the case that the flob must be movated.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that 'The flob is skizzled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
