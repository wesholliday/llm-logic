The first premise is \"It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted.\" This means that it is not necessary for the sneg to be sproted.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either the sneg is crampled or it must be sproted.\" This means that the sneg is either crampled or it must be sproted.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the two possibilities:\n   a) If the sneg is not sproted (as per the first premise), then it must be crampled (as per the second premise).\n   b) If the sneg is sproted, then it cannot be crampled (as per the second premise).\n\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
