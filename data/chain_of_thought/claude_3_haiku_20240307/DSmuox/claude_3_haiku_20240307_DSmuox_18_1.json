This means that the shank is either plooked or it must be nugged.\n\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer that \"The shank is plooked\" from these two premises.\n\nTo do this, we can use the principle of disjunctive syllogism. This states that if we have a disjunction (either A or B) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false, then we can conclude that the other disjunct is true.\n\nIn this case, the first premise tells us that \"the shank must be nugged\" is false.
