The first premise is 'It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled'. This means that the flugel is not necessarily zargled.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled'. This means that the flugel is either blimmed or it must be zargled.\n\n3. Since the first premise tells us that the flugel is not necessarily zargled, the only remaining possibility is that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer 'The flugel is blimmed'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
