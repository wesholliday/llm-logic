This means that it is not necessary for the fribble to be crinked.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked\". This means that the fribble is either snurgled or it must be crinked.\n\n3. From the first premise, we know that it is not necessary for the fribble to be crinked. This means that the fribble must be snurgled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The fribble is snurgled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
