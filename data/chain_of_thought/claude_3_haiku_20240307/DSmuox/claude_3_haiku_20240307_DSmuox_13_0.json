The first premise is \"It's not the case that the glip must be tragged.\" This means that it is not necessary for the glip to be tragged.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged.\" This means that the glip is either slogged or it must be tragged.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the two possibilities:\n   a) If the glip is not tragged (as per the first premise), then it must be slogged (as per the second premise).\n   b) If the glip must be tragged (as per the second premise), then it cannot be the case that it's not the case that the glip must be tragged (as per the first premise).\n\nTherefore, the only possible conclusion is that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
