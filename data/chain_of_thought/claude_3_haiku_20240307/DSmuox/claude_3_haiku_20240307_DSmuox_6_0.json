We are given the following two premises:\n   - \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped\"\n   - \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped\"\n\n2. From the first premise, we can infer that the grommet is not required to be plopped.\n\n3. The second premise states that either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped.\n\n4. Since the grommet is not required to be plopped (from the first premise), the only remaining option is that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The grommet is sploffed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
