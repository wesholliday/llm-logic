The first premise is 'It's not the case that the splat must be quanked'. This means that the splat is not necessarily quanked.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked'. This means that the splat is either morphed or quanked.\n\n3. Since the first premise tells us that the splat is not necessarily quanked, the only remaining possibility is that the splat is morphed.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer 'The splat is morphed'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
