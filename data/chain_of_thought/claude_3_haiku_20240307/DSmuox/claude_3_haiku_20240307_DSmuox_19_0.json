The first premise is 'It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged'. This means that it is not necessary for the smonk to be plagged.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged'. This means that the smonk is either vreebled or plagged, but not both.\n\n3. From the first premise, we know that the smonk is not necessarily plagged. This means that the smonk must be vreebled, since the second premise states that it is either vreebled or plagged.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that 'The smonk is vreebled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
