We are also given the statement \"Either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped\".\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that the smip is not required to be lupped.\n4. From the second statement, we can infer that the smip is either shripped or lupped.\n5. Since the smip is not required to be lupped (from step 3), the only remaining possibility is that the smip is shripped.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
