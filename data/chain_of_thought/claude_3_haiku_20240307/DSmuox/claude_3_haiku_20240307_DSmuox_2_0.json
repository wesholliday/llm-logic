The first premise is 'It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed'. This means that it is not necessary for the wug to be bimmed.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the wug is flooped or it must be bimmed'. This means that the wug is either flooped or it must be bimmed.\n\n3. Since it is not necessary for the wug to be bimmed (from the first premise), the only remaining possibility is that the wug is flooped.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer 'The wug is flooped'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
