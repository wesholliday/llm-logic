The first premise is 'It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked'. This means that the twonk does not necessarily have to be plinked.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked'. This means that the twonk is either varnished or must be plinked, but not both.\n\n3. Since the first premise states that the twonk does not necessarily have to be plinked, the only remaining option is that the twonk is varnished.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that 'The twonk is varnished'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
