The first premise states 'It's not the case that the dreb must be spened'. This means that it is not necessary for the dreb to be spened.\n\n2. The second premise states 'Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened'. This means that the dreb is either vroombed or must be spened, but not both.\n\n3. Combining the two premises, we can conclude that the dreb is not necessary to be spened, and it is either vroombed or must be spened.\n\n4. From this, we can infer that the dreb is vroombed, since the second premise states that it is either vroombed or must be spened, and the first premise eliminates the possibility of it being spened.\n\nAnswer: yes"
