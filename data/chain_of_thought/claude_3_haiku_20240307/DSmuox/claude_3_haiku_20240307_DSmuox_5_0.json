The first premise is 'It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled'. This means that the zinger is not necessarily smoogled.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled'. This means that the zinger is either fraggled or smoogled.\n\n3. Since the first premise tells us that the zinger is not necessarily smoogled, the only remaining possibility is that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that 'The zinger is fraggled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
