The second statement says: \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these two statements:\n- If Fido is not in the garden, then the only other possibility is that Fido is inside.\n- The second statement tells us that Fido is not required to be in the garden.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
