The first statement says that either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed.\n2. The second statement says that it's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that the missing sock is not necessarily under the bed.\n4. Since the first statement says that the missing sock is either in the laundry basket or under the bed, and the second statement eliminates the possibility of it being under the bed, we can conclude that the missing sock must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes"
