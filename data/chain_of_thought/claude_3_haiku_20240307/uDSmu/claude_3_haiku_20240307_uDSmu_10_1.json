Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed.\n2. It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\n\nLet's break down the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The first statement says that the missing sock is either in the laundry basket or under the bed. This means that the missing sock can only be in one of these two locations.\n2. The second statement says that it's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed. This means that the missing sock does not have to be under the bed.\n3. If the missing sock does not have to be under the bed, and it can only be in the laundry basket or under the bed, then the only remaining possibility is that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes"
