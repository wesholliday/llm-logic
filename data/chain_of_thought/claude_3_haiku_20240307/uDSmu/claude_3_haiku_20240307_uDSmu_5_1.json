Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\n2. It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can conclude that if the cookies are not in the jar, then they must be hidden in the pantry. However, the second statement contradicts this, as it says that it's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\n\nIf the cookies are not in the jar and they are also not hidden in the pantry, then there is a logical contradiction. The only way to resolve this contradiction is if the cookies are indeed in the jar.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes"
