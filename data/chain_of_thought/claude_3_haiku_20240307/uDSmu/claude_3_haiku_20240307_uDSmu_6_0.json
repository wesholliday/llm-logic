It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if the phone is not in the living room, then it must be ringing in the kitchen. However, the second statement contradicts this, as it says that it's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen.\n\nTherefore, the only remaining possibility is that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes"
