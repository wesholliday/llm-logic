The first premise states that either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these premises:\n- If the remote control is not hiding under the couch, then it must be on the coffee table, according to the first premise.\n- The second premise tells us that it's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch. This means that it's possible for the remote control to be somewhere else, such as on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
