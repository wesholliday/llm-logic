The second statement is: \"Also, it's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The phone is in the living room.\nThis scenario satisfies the first statement, as the phone is in the living room.\n\nScenario 2: The phone is ringing in the kitchen.\nThis scenario also satisfies the first statement, as the phone is ringing in the kitchen.\n\nHowever, the second statement tells us that it's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen. This means that the second scenario (the phone is ringing in the kitchen) is not possible.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes"
