The statement \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist\" means that the watch is either charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist.\n2. The statement \"it's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist\" means that the watch is not necessarily on his wrist.\n3.
