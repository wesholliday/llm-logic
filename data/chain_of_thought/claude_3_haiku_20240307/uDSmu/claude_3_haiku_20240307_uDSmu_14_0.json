The first statement says: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n2. The second statement says: \"Also, it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the logic:\n- The first statement gives us two possibilities: the milk is either on the counter or in the fridge.\n- The second statement eliminates one of those possibilities by saying that it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\n\nSince the milk cannot be in the fridge, the only remaining possibility is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes"
