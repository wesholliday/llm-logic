The first statement is: \"Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom.\"\nThis means that the cat is either napping on the couch or playing in the bedroom, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.\"\nThis means that the cat is not necessarily playing in the bedroom.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these two statements:\n- If the cat is not necessarily playing in the bedroom, and it's either napping on the couch or playing in the bedroom, then the cat must be napping on the couch.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes"
