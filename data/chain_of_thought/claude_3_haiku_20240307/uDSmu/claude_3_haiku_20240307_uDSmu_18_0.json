This means that the notebook is either in the drawer or on the nightstand, but not necessarily both.\n\n2. The second statement says that it's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand. This means that the notebook is not necessarily on the nightstand.\n\n3. Combining these two statements, we can infer that if the notebook is not on the nightstand, then it must be in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
