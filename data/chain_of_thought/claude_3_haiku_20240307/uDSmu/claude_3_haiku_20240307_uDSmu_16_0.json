It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that the pen is either in the bag or on the desk. The second statement tells us that it's not necessary for the pen to be on the desk.\n\nIf the pen is not necessarily on the desk, then the only other option is that it must be in the bag.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the pen is in your bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
