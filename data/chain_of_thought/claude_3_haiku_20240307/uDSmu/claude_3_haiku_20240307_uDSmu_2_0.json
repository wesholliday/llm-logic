This means that the book is either on the shelf or on the table, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table. This means that the book is not necessarily on the table.\n\n3. Given these two premises, we can infer that the book must be on the shelf. If the book is not necessarily on the table, and it must be either on the shelf or on the table, then the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes"
