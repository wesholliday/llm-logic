The second premise states: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n3. Based on the first premise, we know that the milk can be in one of two places: on the counter or in the fridge.\n4. The second premise tells us that the milk is not necessarily in the fridge.\n5. Since the milk cannot be in the fridge (according to the second premise), and it can only be on the counter or in the fridge (according to the first premise), we can conclude that the milk must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes"
