This means that the toy is either in the toy box or on the bookshelf, but not necessarily both.\n\n2. The second statement says that it's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf. This means that the toy is not necessarily on the bookshelf.\n\n3. Given the first statement, if the toy is not on the bookshelf, then it must be in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
