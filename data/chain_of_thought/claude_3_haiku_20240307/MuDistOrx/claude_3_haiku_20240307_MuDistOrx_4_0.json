The original statement allows for two possibilities: the grazzle is in the flim, or the grazzle is on the grooble. The inferred statement simply restates these two possibilities in a more explicit way, without introducing any new information.\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement is a valid logical conclusion that can be drawn from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
