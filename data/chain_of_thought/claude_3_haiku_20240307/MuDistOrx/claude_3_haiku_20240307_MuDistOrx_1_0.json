The zooble must either be blimple or it must flump a zizz.\n2. The zooble must be either blimple or it must flump a zizz.\n\nThe first interpretation suggests that the zooble has two possible states: it is either blimple or it flumps a zizz. The second interpretation suggests that the zooble must be in one of two states: it is either blimple or it flumps a zizz.\n\nBased on the given information, we can infer that the second interpretation is correct, as the statement \"The zooble must be blimple or it must flump a zizz\" is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
