The shimble must either be snizzle plonk or be zibber. This interpretation suggests that the shimble must be one of the two options, but not both.\n\n2. The shimble must be snizzle plonk or it must be zibber. This interpretation suggests that the shimble can be either snizzle plonk or zibber, but not both.\n\nThe second interpretation, \"The shimble must be snizzle plonk or it must be zibber,\" can be inferred from the given statement. This is because the original statement uses the word \"or,\" which implies that the shimble can be one or the other, but not both.\n\nAnswer: yes"
