            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The plonk must be on wibble or on shimble\" is a disjunctive statement, which means that the plonk must be either on wibble or on shimble, but not both. This statement can be logically equivalent to the statement \"The plonk must be on wibble or it must be on shimble\".\n\nThe reason for this is that the original statement is already expressing the disjunction between the plonk being on wibble or on shimble. By rephrasing it as \"The plonk must be on wibble or it must be on shimble\", we are not changing the logical meaning of the statement, but rather just expressing it in a slightly different way.\n\nAnswer: yes"
