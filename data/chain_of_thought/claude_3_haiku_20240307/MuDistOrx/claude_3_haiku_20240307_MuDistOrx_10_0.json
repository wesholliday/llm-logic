The statement does not explicitly state that the flibbit must be either snork or bimboozle, but rather that it must be one or the other.\n\nTo infer \"The flibbit must be snork or it must be bimboozle\" from the given statement, we would need to make an additional assumption that the flibbit must be one of the two options, and cannot be neither. This assumption is not explicitly stated in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
