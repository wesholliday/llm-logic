It's not the case that the cat must have been outside.\n\nFrom the second statement, we can infer that the cat may or may not have been outside. This means that the first statement, \"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside,\" is not necessarily true.\n\nIf the first statement is not necessarily true, then we cannot infer that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: no"
