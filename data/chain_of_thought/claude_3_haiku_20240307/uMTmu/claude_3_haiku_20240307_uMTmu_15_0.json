The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n4. However, the second statement tells us that it's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\n5. This means that the first statement, \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train,\" cannot be true.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes"
