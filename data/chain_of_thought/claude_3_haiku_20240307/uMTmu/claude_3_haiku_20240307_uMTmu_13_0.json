The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\"\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that the truck was not necessarily blue.\n4. If the truck was not necessarily blue, then the first statement (\"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\") cannot be true.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
