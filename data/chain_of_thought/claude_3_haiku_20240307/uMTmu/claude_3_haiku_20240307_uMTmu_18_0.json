The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\"\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that the truck was not necessarily metal.\n4. If the truck was not necessarily metal, then the first statement (\"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\") cannot be true.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes"
