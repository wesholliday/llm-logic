The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\n3. The question is asking whether we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nLet's consider the two statements:\n* The first statement implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n* The second statement contradicts the first statement by saying that it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nSince the second statement contradicts the first statement, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
