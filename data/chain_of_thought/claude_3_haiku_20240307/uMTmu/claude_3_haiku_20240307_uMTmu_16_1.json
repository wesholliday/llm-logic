The first statement is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the shirt being cotton) is true, then the conclusion (the pants being denim) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"it's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\" This means that the conclusion from the first statement (the pants being denim) is not necessarily true.\n\n3. Now, we need to consider the implications of these two statements together. If the first statement is true (the shirt was cotton), but the second statement is also true (the pants were not necessarily denim), then the only way for both statements to be true is if the first statement (the shirt was cotton) is not true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes"

This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the shirt was cotton) is true, then the consequent (the pants must have been denim) is also true.
