The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\"\n3. The question is asking whether we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nLet's consider the two statements:\n- The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequent (Jen must have watched basketball) must also be true.\n- The second statement contradicts the consequent of the first statement, which means that the antecedent (Tom watched football) must be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes"
