The first statement is: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\"\n   This means that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the mummy was awake, the vampire was also awake.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\"\n   This means that the mummy being awake is not a necessary condition.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer that the vampire was not awake?\"\n   Based on the given information, we cannot infer that the vampire was not awake. The first statement only tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. It does not provide any information about the vampire's state of wakefulness.\n\nAnswer: no"
