The second statement is: \"Also, it's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\"\n3. The question is asking whether we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nThe key to answering this is the second statement. If it is not the case that the book must be a mystery novel, then the first statement cannot be true. This means that the premise \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\" is false.\n\nIf the premise is false, then the conclusion that the book was not written by James does not necessarily follow. The fact that the book is not a mystery novel does not necessarily mean that it was not written by James.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: no"
