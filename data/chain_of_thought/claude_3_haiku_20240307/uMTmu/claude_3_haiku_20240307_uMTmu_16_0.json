The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\"\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that the pants were not necessarily denim.\n4. If the pants were not necessarily denim, then the first statement (\"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\") cannot be true.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes"
