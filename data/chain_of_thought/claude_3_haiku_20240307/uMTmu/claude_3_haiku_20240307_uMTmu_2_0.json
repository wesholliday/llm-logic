The first statement is: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest as well.\n4. However, the second statement contradicts this, as it states that it's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes"
