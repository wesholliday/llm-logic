The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\" This means that it is not a certainty that Chris finished the race.\n\n3. Now, we need to consider the implications of these two statements. If the first statement is true (that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race), but the second statement is also true (that it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race), then we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes"

From premise (b), we can infer that Chris did not necessarily finish the race.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the contrapositive of premise (a): If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\n\n4. Since we know from premise (b) that Chris did not necessarily finish the race, we can apply the contrapositive of premise (a) to conclude that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes"
