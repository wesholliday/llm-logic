The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\" This statement contradicts the first statement, as it suggests that the banana was not necessarily yellow.\n\n3.

The first statement suggests that the apple was red, but the second statement contradicts this, leaving the status of the apple's color uncertain.\n\nAnswer: no"
