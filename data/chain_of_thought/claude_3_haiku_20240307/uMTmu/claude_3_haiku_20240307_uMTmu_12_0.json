            "content": "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The first statement is: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Joe went to the park) is true, then the consequent (Lucy must have gone to the zoo) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This is the negation of the consequent in the first statement.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\nIf the first statement is true and the second statement is also true, then we can infer that the antecedent of the first statement (Joe went to the park) must be false. This is because if the antecedent were true, then the consequent (Lucy must have gone to the zoo) would also have to be true, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes"
