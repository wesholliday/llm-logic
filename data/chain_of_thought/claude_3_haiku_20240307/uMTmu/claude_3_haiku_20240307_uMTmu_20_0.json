The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\"\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that the banana was not necessarily yellow.\n4. If the banana was not necessarily yellow, then the first statement (\"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\") cannot be true.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
