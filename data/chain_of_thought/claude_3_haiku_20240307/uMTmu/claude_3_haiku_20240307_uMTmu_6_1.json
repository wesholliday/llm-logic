The question is asking whether we can infer that \"Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\nLet's consider the first statement. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. This means that if Sue chose something other than pizza, then Bob did not have to choose pasta.\n\nThe second statement tells us that it's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta. This means that Bob did not necessarily choose pasta.\n\nCombining these two pieces of information, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza. If she had chosen pizza, then Bob would have had to choose pasta, but the second statement tells us that this is not the case.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes"

Now, let's consider the logical relationship between the two statements. If the first statement is true, then the second statement must be false. This is because if Bob must have chosen pasta (as stated in the first statement), then it cannot be the case that Bob did not choose pasta (as stated in the second statement).\n\n4.
