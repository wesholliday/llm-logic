If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there as well (according to the first statement). However, the second statement tells us that it is not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\nThis contradiction means that the initial assumption, that Mary was at the wedding, cannot be true. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there, but the second statement tells us that this is not the case.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes"
