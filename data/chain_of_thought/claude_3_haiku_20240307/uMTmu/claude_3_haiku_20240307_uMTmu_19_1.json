However, this statement does not tell us anything about whether Tom actually watched football or not.\n\nThe second statement is the negation of the conclusion in the first statement: \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\" This means that Jen did not necessarily watch basketball, even if Tom watched football.\n\nNow, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. The first statement tells us that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. The second statement tells us that it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nSince the second statement is the negation of the conclusion in the first statement, we can infer that the antecedent of the first statement (i.e., \"Tom watched football\") must be false.
