This means that the zinger was not necessarily fraggled, or in other words, the zinger might not have been fraggled.\n\nTherefore, the inference 'The zinger might not have been fraggled' can be made from the original statement 'It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
