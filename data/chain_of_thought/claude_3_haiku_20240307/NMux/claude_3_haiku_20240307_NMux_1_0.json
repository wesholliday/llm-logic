This means that it is not necessarily the case that the flugel was blimmed.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the flugel might not have been blimmed. If it is not necessarily the case that the flugel was blimmed, then it is possible that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The flugel might not have been blimmed' from the given statement 'It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
