This means that the original statement is true if and only if 'The glip must have been slogged' is false.\n\nNow, the statement 'The glip might not have been slogged' is the logical opposite of 'The glip must have been slogged'. If 'The glip must have been slogged' is false, then 'The glip might not have been slogged' must be true.\n\nTherefore, from the statement 'It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged', we can infer 'The glip might not have been slogged'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
