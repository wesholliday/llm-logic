This means that the original statement is denying the necessity of the fribble being snurgled.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement 'The fribble might not have been snurgled'. This statement expresses the possibility that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nSince the original statement denies the necessity of the fribble being snurgled, it implies that the fribble might not have been snurgled. In other words, the possibility that the fribble was not snurgled is a logical consequence of the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The fribble might not have been snurgled' from the statement 'It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
