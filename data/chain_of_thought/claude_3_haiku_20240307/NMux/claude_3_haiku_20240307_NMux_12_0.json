This means that it is not necessarily the case that the smip must have been shripped.\n\nNow, if it is not necessarily the case that the smip must have been shripped, then it is possible that the smip might not have been shripped. This is because the negation of 'must have been' is 'might not have been'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The smip might not have been shripped' from the given statement 'It's not the case that the smip must have been shripped'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
