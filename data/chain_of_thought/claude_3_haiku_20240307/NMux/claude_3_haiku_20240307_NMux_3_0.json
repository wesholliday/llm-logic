This means that the original statement is true if and only if 'The splat must have been morphed' is false.\n\nNow, the statement 'The splat might not have been morphed' is the logical opposite of 'The splat must have been morphed'. If 'The splat must have been morphed' is false, then 'The splat might not have been morphed' must be true.\n\nTherefore, from the statement 'It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed', we can infer 'The splat might not have been morphed'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
