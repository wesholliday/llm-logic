This means that the original statement is true if and only if 'The twonk must have been plinked' is false.\n\nIf 'The twonk must have been plinked' is false, then it is possible that 'The twonk might not have been plinked' is true. This is because the statement 'The twonk might not have been plinked' is the logical opposite of 'The twonk must have been plinked'.\n\nTherefore, from the original statement 'It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked', we can infer 'The twonk might not have been plinked'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
