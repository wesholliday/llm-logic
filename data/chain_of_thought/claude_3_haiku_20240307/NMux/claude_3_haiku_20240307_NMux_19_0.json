This means that the original statement is true if and only if the statement 'The smonk must have been vreebled' is false.\n\nNow, the statement 'The smonk might not have been vreebled' is the logical opposite of 'The smonk must have been vreebled'. If the original statement 'It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled' is true, then the statement 'The smonk might not have been vreebled' must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The smonk might not have been vreebled' from the statement 'It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
