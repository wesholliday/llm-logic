This means that it is not necessarily true that the dreb must have been vroombed.\n\nIf it is not necessarily true that the dreb must have been vroombed, then it is possible that the dreb might not have been vroombed. This is because the negation of a necessity statement (must have been) implies the possibility of the opposite (might not have been).\n\nTherefore, from the given statement 'It's not the case that the dreb must have been vroombed', we can infer 'The dreb might not have been vroombed'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
