This means that the original statement is true if and only if the statement 'The fleeg must have been bluttered' is false.\n\nNow, the statement 'The fleeg might not have been bluttered' is the logical opposite of the statement 'The fleeg must have been bluttered'. If the statement 'The fleeg must have been bluttered' is false, then the statement 'The fleeg might not have been bluttered' must be true.\n\nTherefore, from the original statement 'It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered', we can infer 'The fleeg might not have been bluttered'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
