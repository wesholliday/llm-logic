The negation of necessity (i.e., \"It's not the case that the shank must have been plooked\") does not necessarily imply the possibility of the opposite (i.e., \"The shank might not have been plooked\"). The absence of necessity does not automatically mean the presence of possibility.\n\n2. However, in this case, the negation of necessity does allow for the possibility of the opposite.
