This means that the original statement is denying the necessity of the sneg being crampled.\n\nNow, the statement 'The sneg might not have been crampled' is the logical opposite of 'The sneg must have been crampled'. If the original statement denies the necessity of the sneg being crampled, then it logically follows that the sneg might not have been crampled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The sneg might not have been crampled' from 'It's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
