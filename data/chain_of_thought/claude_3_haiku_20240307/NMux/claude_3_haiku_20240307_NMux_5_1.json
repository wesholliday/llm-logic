The original statement 'It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled' is a negation of the statement 'The zinger must have been fraggled'.\n2. Negating the statement 'The zinger must have been fraggled' implies that it is not necessary for the zinger to have been fraggled.\n3. If it is not necessary for the zinger to have been fraggled, then it is possible that the zinger might not have been fraggled.\n4.
