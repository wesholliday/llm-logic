This means that the original statement is denying the necessity of the clug being fleeked.\n\nNow, if we negate the necessity of the clug being fleeked, it implies that the clug might not have been fleeked. This is because the negation of necessity is possibility.\n\nTherefore, from the statement 'It's not the case that the clug must have been fleeked', we can infer 'The clug might not have been fleeked'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
