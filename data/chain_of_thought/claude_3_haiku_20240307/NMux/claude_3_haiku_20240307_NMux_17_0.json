This means that it is not necessarily true that the flob must have been skizzled.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the flob might not have been skizzled. If it is not the case that the flob must have been skizzled, then it is possible that the flob might not have been skizzled.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
