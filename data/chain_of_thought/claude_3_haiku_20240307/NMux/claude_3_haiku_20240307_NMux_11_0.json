This means that it is not necessarily the case that the flug must have been blummed.\n\nNow, the statement 'The flug might not have been blummed' is the logical opposite of 'The flug must have been blummed'. If it is not the case that the flug must have been blummed, then it is possible that the flug might not have been blummed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The flug might not have been blummed' from the given statement 'It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
