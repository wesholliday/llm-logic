In other words, it is saying that it is not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered.\n\nNow, the proposed inference is: \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered.\"\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe given statement, \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered,\" is a negation of the necessity of the fleeg being bluttered. This means that it is not necessary for the fleeg to have been bluttered.\n\nThe proposed inference, \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered,\" is a statement of possibility.
