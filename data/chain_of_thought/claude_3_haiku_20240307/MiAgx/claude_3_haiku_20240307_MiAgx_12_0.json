The use of the word \"might\" suggests that the statement is speculative and does not necessarily represent a factual situation.\n\nFrom this statement, we cannot infer the statement \"It might be that the plimp is wozzle by flonk and the fizzle is fribble gribble\" with certainty. The original statement does not provide enough information to determine whether the plimp is definitively wozzle by flonk or the fizzle is definitively fribble gribble.\n\nAnswer: No"
