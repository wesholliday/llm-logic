The words used in the original statement, such as \"plimp\", \"glorp\", \"crunk\", \"floob\", \"gribble\", \"blurble\", and \"shimble\", are nonsensical and do not have any clear meaning or relationship to each other. Without any context or defined meanings for these terms, it is not possible to make a logical inference from the original statement to the proposed conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
