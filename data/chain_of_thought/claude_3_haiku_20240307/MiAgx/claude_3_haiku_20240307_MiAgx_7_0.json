It uses the word \"might\" to indicate possibility or likelihood, rather than certainty.\n\nFrom this statement, we can infer that:\n1. It is possible that the zump is quorple.\n2. It is possible that the snizzle wibbles froodle zibber.\n\nHowever, the statement does not definitively state that \"the zump is quorple\" or \"the snizzle wibbles froodle zibber\". It only suggests the possibility of these events occurring.\n\nTherefore, the inference \"It might be that the zump is quorple and the snizzle wibbles froodle zibber\" is a valid and reasonable conclusion that can be drawn from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
