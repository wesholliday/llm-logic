The original statement only suggests the possibility of the bimboozle being flonk and the floob being a quank, but does not definitively state that this is the case. To infer the second statement, we would need more information to confirm that the bimboozle is indeed flonk and the floob is indeed a quank, rather than just the possibility of these relationships.\n\nAnswer: no"
