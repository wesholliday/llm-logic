This means that both statements are true, but they are independent of each other.\n\nThe statement \"It might be that the snorkel is plonk and the snork is wibble\" is also a conjunction of two statements: \"The snorkel is plonk\" and \"The snork is wibble\". This statement is stronger than the given statement, as it makes a definitive claim about the relationship between the snorkel and plonk, as well as the snork and wibble.\n\nSince the given statement only suggests the possibility of the snorkel being plonk and the snork being wibble, but does not make a definitive claim about their relationship, we cannot infer the stronger statement \"It might be that the snorkel is plonk and the snork is wibble\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
