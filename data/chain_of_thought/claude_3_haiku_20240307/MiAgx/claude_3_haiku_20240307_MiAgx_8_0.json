The use of made-up words and the lack of context make it difficult to infer any specific conclusions about the relationships between these entities.\n\nWithout more information or context, the statement \"It might be that the zizz is snizzle on quank and the wibble wumps fizzle quimble\" cannot be definitively inferred from the given statement. The new statement introduces additional claims about the relationships between the entities, which are not clearly supported by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No"
