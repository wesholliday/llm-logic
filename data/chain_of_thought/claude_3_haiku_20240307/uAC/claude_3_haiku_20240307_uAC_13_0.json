However, this does not necessarily mean that if the truck was blue, then the car was red.\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement: \"The truck was blue.\" This statement is consistent with the first statement, as it confirms that the truck was blue.\n\nNow, the question is whether we can infer that the car was red based on the given information.\n\nThe first statement tells us that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. The second statement tells us that the truck was blue. However, this does not necessarily mean that the car was red. The first statement does not provide a guarantee that the car was red, it only states that if the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the car was red.\n\nAnswer: no"
