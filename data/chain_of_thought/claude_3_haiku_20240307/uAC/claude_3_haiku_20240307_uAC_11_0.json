However, this statement does not tell us anything about the actual color of the cake.\n\nThe second statement is: \"Also, the muffins were blueberry.\" This statement directly tells us that the muffins were blueberry.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n- If the muffins were blueberry (second statement), and the first statement is true, then the cake must have been chocolate.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes"
