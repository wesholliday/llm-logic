            "content": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the given information and the logical implications.\n\nThe first statement is: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. However, this statement does not tell us anything about the actual material of the doll.\n\nThe second statement is: \"The truck was metal.\" This statement directly tells us that the truck was made of metal.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer that the doll was plastic?\"\n\nTo infer that the doll was plastic, we would need to use the information from the first statement, which says that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. Since we know that the truck was metal, we could then infer that the doll was plastic.\n\nHowever, the first statement does not tell us that the doll was definitely plastic. It only says that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. It does not provide any information about the actual material of the doll.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: no"
