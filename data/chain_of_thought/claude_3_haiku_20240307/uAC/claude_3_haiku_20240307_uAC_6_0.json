However, this does not necessarily mean that the condition \"Sue chose pizza\" is also true.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that the truth of the consequence does not automatically imply the truth of the condition.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sue chose pizza based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
