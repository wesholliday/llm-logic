The second statement tells us that the book is a mystery novel. However, the first statement does not tell us that if the book is a mystery novel, then it was written by James.\n\nIn other words, the fact that the book is a mystery novel does not necessarily mean that it was written by James. There could be other authors who have written mystery novels as well.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the book was written by James.\n\nAnswer: no"
