The second statement tells us that Lucy did go to the zoo. However, the first statement does not tell us anything about the truth of the condition \"Joe went to the park.\" It only tells us that if this condition is true, then the consequence \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is also true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Joe went to the park based on the given information. The fact that Lucy went to the zoo does not necessarily imply that Joe went to the park.\n\nAnswer: no"
