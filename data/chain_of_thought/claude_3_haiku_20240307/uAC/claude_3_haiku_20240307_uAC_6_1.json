Since we know that Bob chose pasta, this means that the condition \"if Sue chose pizza\" must be true. However, this does not necessarily mean that Sue actually chose pizza.\n\nIn other words, the fact that Bob chose pasta is consistent with Sue choosing pizza, but it does not necessarily imply that Sue did choose pizza.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that Sue chose pizza.\n\nAnswer: no"
