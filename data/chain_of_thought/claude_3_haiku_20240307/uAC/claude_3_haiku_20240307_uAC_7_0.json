Chris finished the race.\n\nThe question is asking whether we can infer that Alex finished the race.\n\nLet's think through this step by step:\n1. The first statement tells us that if Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished the race. This means that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris also did not finish the race.\n2. The second statement tells us that Chris did finish the race.\n3. Since we know that Chris finished the race, we can infer that Alex must have also finished the race, based on the first statement.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
