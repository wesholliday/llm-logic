If the first statement is true, and the second statement is true, then we can infer that the condition \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" must also be true.\n2. However, the first statement is a conditional statement, and the second statement does not provide any information about whether the condition \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no"
