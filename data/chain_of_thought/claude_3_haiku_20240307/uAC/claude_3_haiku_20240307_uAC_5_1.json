The first statement is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the second part (Amy playing tennis) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Amy played tennis.\" This is a simple statement of fact.\n\n3. The question is asking whether we can infer that Jeff played basketball based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no\n\nExplanation: The fact that Amy played tennis does not necessarily mean that Jeff played basketball. The first statement only tells us that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis, but it does not tell us anything about whether Jeff actually played basketball or not. Therefore, we cannot infer from the given information that Jeff played basketball."
