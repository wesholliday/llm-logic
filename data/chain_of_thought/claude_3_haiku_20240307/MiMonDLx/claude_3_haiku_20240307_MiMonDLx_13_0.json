The statement only indicates that the zooble might be quork, but it does not rule out the possibility that the zooble might be something else as well, such as grazzle. \n\nTo infer that \"The zooble might be quork or grazzle\" from the original statement, we would need additional information that explicitly states or implies that the zooble could be either quork or grazzle. The original statement does not provide that information.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer \"The zooble might be quork or grazzle\" from the given statement \"The zooble might be quork\"."
