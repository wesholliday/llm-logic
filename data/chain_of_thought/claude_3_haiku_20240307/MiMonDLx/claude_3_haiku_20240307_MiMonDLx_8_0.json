The statement only indicates that the gribble might be a quork, but it does not make any claims about the gribble being a grazzle or not. Without any additional information about the relationship between the gribble, quork, and grazzle, we cannot infer that \"The gribble might be quork or grazzle\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
