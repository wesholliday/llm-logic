The structure of modus ponens is as follows:\nIf P, then Q.\nP.\nTherefore, Q.\n\nIn the given argument, the first premise establishes a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" The second premise affirms the antecedent (P) of the conditional statement, which is \"the cake was chocolate.\" Therefore, the conclusion \"the muffins were blueberry\" necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
