It states that if we have a conditional statement (if A, then B) and the antecedent (A) is true, then we can validly conclude the consequent (B).\n\nIn the given argument, the first premise states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. The second premise states that Ben ate pasta. Therefore, the conclusion that Kate ate salad follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
