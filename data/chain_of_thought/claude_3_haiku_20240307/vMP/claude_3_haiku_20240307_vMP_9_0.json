            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If A, then B\nPremise 2: A\nConclusion: B\n\nThis form of argument is known as the modus ponens rule of inference. It states that if we have a conditional statement (if A, then B) and the antecedent (A) is true, then we can validly conclude the consequent (B).\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt (Premise 1).\n2. Lisa bought the red shirt (Premise 2).\n3. Therefore, Mark bought the blue shirt (Conclusion).\n\nThe conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, as the modus ponens rule of inference is a valid form of argument.\n\nAnswer: yes"
