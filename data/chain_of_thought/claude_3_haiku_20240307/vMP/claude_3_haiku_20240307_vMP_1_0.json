            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following structure:\nPremise 1: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\nPremise 2: Mary was at the wedding.\nConclusion: Sue was at the wedding.\n\nThis argument form is known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of deductive reasoning. The key steps in the reasoning are:\n\n1. The first premise states a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that if the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequent (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true.\n\n2. The second premise affirms the antecedent of the conditional statement, which is \"Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\n3. Since the antecedent is true, and the conditional statement states that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true, the conclusion \"Sue was at the wedding\" necessarily follows.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
