The structure of the argument is as follows:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nP.\nTherefore, Q.\n\nIn the given argument, P represents \"the dog was inside,\" and Q represents \"the cat was outside.\" The first premise states that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. The second premise affirms that the dog was inside. Therefore, the conclusion that the cat was outside follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
