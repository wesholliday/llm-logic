The logical validity of this form can be established as follows:\n\n1. The first premise, \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball,\" is a conditional statement. It states that if the antecedent (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequent (Jen watched basketball) is also true.\n2. The second premise, \"Tom watched football,\" affirms the antecedent of the conditional statement.\n3.
