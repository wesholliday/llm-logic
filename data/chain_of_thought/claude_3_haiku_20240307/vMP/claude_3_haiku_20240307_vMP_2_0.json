            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to examine the logical form of the argument and check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\nPremise 2: The griffin was in the forest.\nConclusion: The unicorn was in the forest.\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of deductive reasoning. The key steps in the reasoning are:\n\n1. The first premise states a conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n2. The second premise affirms the antecedent of the conditional statement: \"The griffin was in the forest.\"\n3. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows that the consequent of the conditional statement is true: \"The unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\nSince the argument follows the valid form of modus ponens, the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
