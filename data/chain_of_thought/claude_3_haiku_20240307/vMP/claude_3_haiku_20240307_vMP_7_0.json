The logic behind it is as follows:\n\n1. If the first premise is true (if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race), and the second premise is true (Alex finished the race), then the conclusion must also be true (Chris finished the race).\n\n2. The argument is valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. If the premises are true, the conclusion cannot be false.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
