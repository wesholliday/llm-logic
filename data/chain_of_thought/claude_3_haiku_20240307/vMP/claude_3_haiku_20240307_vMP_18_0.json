            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\nPremise 2: The doll was plastic.\nConclusion: The truck was metal.\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of deductive reasoning. The logic behind it is as follows:\n\n1. The first premise states a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This means that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n2. The second premise affirms the antecedent of the conditional statement, which is \"the doll was plastic.\"\n3. Since the first premise establishes a connection between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal, and the second premise confirms that the doll was plastic, the conclusion \"the truck was metal\" necessarily follows.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
