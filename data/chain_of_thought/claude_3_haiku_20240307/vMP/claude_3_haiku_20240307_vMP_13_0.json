The structure of modus ponens is as follows:\nIf P, then Q.\nP.\nTherefore, Q.\n\nIn the given argument, the first premise states that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. The second premise confirms that the car was red. Therefore, the conclusion that the truck was blue follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
