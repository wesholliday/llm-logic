            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\nPremise 2: The apple was red.\nConclusion: The banana was yellow.\n\nThis argument form is known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of deductive reasoning. The key steps in the reasoning are:\n\n1. The first premise states a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This means that if the antecedent (the apple was red) is true, then the consequent (the banana was yellow) must also be true.\n\n2. The second premise affirms the antecedent of the conditional statement, which is \"the apple was red.\"\n\n3. Since the antecedent is true, and the conditional statement is true, we can logically conclude that the consequent, \"the banana was yellow,\" must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
