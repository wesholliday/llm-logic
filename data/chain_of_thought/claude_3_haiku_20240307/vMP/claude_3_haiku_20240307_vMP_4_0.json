The key steps in the reasoning are:\n\n1. The first premise states a conditional statement: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\"\n2. The second premise affirms the antecedent of the conditional statement: \"The alien visited Mars.\"\n3. From the conditional statement and the affirmation of the antecedent, we can logically conclude the consequent: \"The robot visited Jupiter.\"\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
