It is a valid form of argument, meaning that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n1. The first premise states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. This is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between the two events.\n2. The second premise states that Ben ate pasta, which affirms the antecedent (A) of the conditional statement in the first premise.\n3.
