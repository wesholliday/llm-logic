It is a valid form of argument, which means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n1. The first premise states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. This is a conditional statement, which means that it establishes a relationship between the two conditions.\n2. The second premise states that the shirt was cotton. This satisfies the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional statement in the first premise.\n3. Since the antecedent is true, the argument can validly conclude that the consequent (the \"then\" part) is also true, which is that the pants were denim.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
