The structure of the argument is as follows:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nP.\nTherefore, Q.\n\nIn this case, P represents \"the shirt was cotton,\" and Q represents \"the pants were denim.\" The first premise establishes a conditional relationship between the shirt being cotton and the pants being denim. The second premise affirms the antecedent (P), and the conclusion correctly deduces the consequent (Q).\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
