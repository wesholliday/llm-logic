It states that if the first premise is a conditional statement (if A, then B) and the second premise affirms the antecedent (A), then the conclusion that affirms the consequent (B) is logically valid.\n\nIn the given argument, the first premise states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. The second premise states that Sam took a plane. Therefore, the conclusion that Erin took a train necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
