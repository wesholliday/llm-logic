            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\nPremise 2: Jeff played basketball.\nConclusion: Amy played tennis.\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of deductive reasoning. The logic behind it is as follows:\n\n1. The first premise states a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This means that if the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) is true, then the consequent (Amy played tennis) must also be true.\n\n2. The second premise affirms the antecedent of the conditional statement, which is \"Jeff played basketball.\"\n\n3. Since the antecedent is true, and the conditional statement states that the consequent follows from the antecedent, the conclusion \"Amy played tennis\" necessarily follows.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
