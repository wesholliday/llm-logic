The structure of modus ponens is as follows:\nIf P, then Q.\nP.\nTherefore, Q.\n\nIn the given argument, the first premise establishes a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" The second premise affirms the antecedent (the vampire was awake), and the conclusion correctly deduces the consequent (the mummy was awake).\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
