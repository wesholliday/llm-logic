We are also given that the statement \"Erin took a train\" is true.\n3. The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the antecedent (Sam took a plane) is true, then the consequent (Erin took a train) must also be true.\n4. However, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. This means that just because the consequent (Erin took a train) is true, it does not necessarily follow that the antecedent (Sam took a plane) is also true.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \"Sam took a plane\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
