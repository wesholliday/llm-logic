However, the converse is not necessarily true - if the mummy was awake, it does not necessarily mean the vampire was awake.\n5) Since we know the mummy was awake, the first statement tells us that the vampire must have been awake as well. However, this is not a logical necessity, as the mummy could have been awake for reasons unrelated to the vampire's state.\n\nAnswer: no"
