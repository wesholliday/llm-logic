This means that if the condition \"Tom watched football\" is true, then the consequence \"Jen watched basketball\" must also be true. However, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. Just because the consequence \"Jen watched basketball\" is true, it does not automatically mean that the condition \"Tom watched football\" is also true.\n\nThe second statement, \"Jen watched basketball,\" is true by the given information.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Does it necessarily follow that 'Tom watched football' is true?\"\n\nTo answer this, we need to look at the implications of the given information. The first statement tells us that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. Since we know that Jen did watch basketball, this means that the condition \"Tom watched football\" could be true. However, it does not necessarily mean that it is true.\n\nIn other words, the truth of \"Jen watched basketball\" does not automatically imply the truth of \"Tom watched football.\" There could be other reasons or scenarios where Jen watched basketball, even if Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: No, it does not necessarily follow that \"Tom watched football\" is true."
