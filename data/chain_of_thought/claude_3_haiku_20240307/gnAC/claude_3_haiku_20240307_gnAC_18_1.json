This is a conditional statement, which means that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. It does not necessarily mean that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The truck was metal\". This is a true statement.\n\n3. From the first statement, we know that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. Since the truck was metal, we can infer that the doll was plastic.\n\nHowever, the conditional statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" does not necessarily imply the reverse statement \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic\". This is because the conditional statement only tells us that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal, but it does not tell us anything about the doll if the truck was metal.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot necessarily conclude that \"The doll was plastic\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
