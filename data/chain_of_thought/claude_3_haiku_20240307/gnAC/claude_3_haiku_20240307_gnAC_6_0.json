We are also given that \"Bob chose pasta\" is true.\n3. The statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the antecedent (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the consequent (Bob chose pasta) must also be true.\n4. Since we know that the consequent (Bob chose pasta) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (Sue chose pizza) is also true.\n5. There could be other possible scenarios where Bob chose pasta, even if Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: no"
