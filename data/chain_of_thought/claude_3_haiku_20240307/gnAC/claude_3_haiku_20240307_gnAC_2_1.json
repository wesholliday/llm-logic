If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n2. The unicorn was in the forest.\n\nThe question is whether it necessarily follows that the griffin was in the forest.\n\nLet's think through this step by step:\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This means that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest.\n2. The second statement is that the unicorn was in the forest. This means that the condition in the first statement is true (the unicorn was in the forest).\n3.
