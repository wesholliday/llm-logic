This means that if the condition \"the book was written by James\" is true, then the consequence \"the book is a mystery novel\" must also be true.\n\nThe second statement, \"The book is a mystery novel,\" is true.\n\nNow, the question is whether the third statement, \"The book was written by James,\" necessarily follows from the first two statements.\n\nTo determine this, we need to consider the logical structure of the conditional statement. A conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\" does not necessarily imply that \"A\" is true, even if \"B\" is true.\n\nIn other words, just because the book is a mystery novel (the consequence is true), it does not necessarily mean that the book was written by James (the condition is true).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no"
