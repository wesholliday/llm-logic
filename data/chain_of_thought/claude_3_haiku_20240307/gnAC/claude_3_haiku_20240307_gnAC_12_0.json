We are also given that the statement \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is true.\n3. The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the antecedent (Joe went to the park) is true, then the consequent (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true.\n4. However, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. This means that just because the consequent (Lucy went to the zoo) is true, it does not necessarily follow that the antecedent (Joe went to the park) is also true.\n5. Therefore, based on the given information, it does not necessarily follow that \"Joe went to the park\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
