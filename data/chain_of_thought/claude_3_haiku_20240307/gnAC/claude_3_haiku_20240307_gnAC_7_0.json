This is because the conditional statement only tells us that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent is true, but it does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \"Alex finished the race\" is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no"
