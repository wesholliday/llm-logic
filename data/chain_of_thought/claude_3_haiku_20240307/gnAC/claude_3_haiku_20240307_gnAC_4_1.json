The statement \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the antecedent (the alien visited Mars) is true, then the consequent (the robot visited Jupiter) must also be true.\n\n2. The statement \"The robot visited Jupiter\" is given as true.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the original question: \"Does it necessarily follow that 'The alien visited Mars' is true?\"\n\nTo answer this, we need to consider the contrapositive of the original conditional statement. The contrapositive of \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" is \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\"\n\n4. Since we know that the robot did visit Jupiter (the second given statement), the contrapositive tells us that the alien must have visited Mars.
