This means that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. However, this statement does not necessarily imply that if the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the cave.\n\nThe second statement, \"The wolf was in the den,\" is true. This means that the condition in the first statement is satisfied, and we can conclude that the bear was in the cave.\n\nTherefore, given the information provided, it necessarily follows that \"The bear was in the cave\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
