It means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must also have been at the wedding. This statement does not, however, tell us anything about whether Mary was actually at the wedding or not.\n\nThe second statement, \"Sue was at the wedding,\" is a simple, categorical statement that tells us that Sue was present at the wedding.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use the rules of logic to determine whether \"Mary was at the wedding\" necessarily follows.\n\nIf the first statement is true (i.e., \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\") and the second statement is also true (i.e., \"Sue was at the wedding\"), then we can infer that Mary must have been at the wedding as well. This is because the first statement tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also there, and the second statement confirms that Sue was indeed there.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
