It only suggests that the glorp might be one or the other, but does not specify if it is both. To infer that \"The glorp might be floob or it might be on flimble\" would require making an additional assumption that the glorp cannot be both floob and on flimble at the same time. The original statement does not provide enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: No"
