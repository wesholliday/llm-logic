The original statement only indicates that the wibble might be on the zizz or in the snizzle, but it does not explicitly state that the wibble might be in the snizzle. The inference that the wibble \"might be in the snizzle\" is not directly supported by the information given in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No"
