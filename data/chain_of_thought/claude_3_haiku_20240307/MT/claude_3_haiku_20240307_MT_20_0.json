            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'The apple was not red' from the given premises, let's analyze the logic step-by-step:\n\n1. The first premise is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\n\n2. The second premise is 'The banana was not yellow'. This contradicts the conclusion that would be drawn from the first premise, which is that the banana was yellow.\n\n3. From the two premises, we cannot infer that 'The apple was not red'. The first premise only tells us that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. The second premise tells us that the banana was not yellow, but this does not necessarily mean that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: no"
