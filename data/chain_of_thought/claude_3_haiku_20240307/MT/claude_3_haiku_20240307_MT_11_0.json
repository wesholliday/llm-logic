The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n2. The second statement is the negation of the consequent of the first statement: \"The muffins were not blueberry.\"\n3. From the rules of logic, when we have a conditional statement and the negation of the consequent, we can infer the negation of the antecedent.\n4. In this case, the antecedent is \"the cake was chocolate,\" and the negation of the antecedent is \"the cake was not chocolate.\"\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer 'The cake was not chocolate'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
