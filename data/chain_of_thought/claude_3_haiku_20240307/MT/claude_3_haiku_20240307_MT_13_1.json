The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This means that if the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n\n2. The second statement is the negation of the consequent in the first statement: \"The truck was not blue.\" This means that the truck was not blue.\n\n3. Now, we need to consider the implications of the second statement. If the truck was not blue, then the first statement (\"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\") cannot be true. This means that either the car was not red, or the truck was not blue (or both).\n\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"The car was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"

To infer 'The car was not red', we need to use the logical principle of modus tollens.\n4. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and the negation of the consequent (Q), then we can infer the negation of the antecedent (P).\n5. In this case, the conditional statement is \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" The negation of the consequent is \"The truck was not blue.\"\n6.
