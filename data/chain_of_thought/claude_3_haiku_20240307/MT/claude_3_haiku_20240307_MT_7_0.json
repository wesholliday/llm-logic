The first statement is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Alex finished the race) is true, then the consequent (Chris finished the race) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Chris did not finish the race.\" This is the negation of the consequent in the first statement.\n\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer \"Alex did not finish the race\" from these two statements.\n\n4. If the consequent (Chris finished the race) is false, then the antecedent (Alex finished the race) must also be false, according to the rules of conditional logic.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
