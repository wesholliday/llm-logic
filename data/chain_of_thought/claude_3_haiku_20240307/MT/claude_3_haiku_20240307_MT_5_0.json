The first statement is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) is true, then the consequent (Amy played tennis) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Amy did not play tennis.\" This directly contradicts the consequent of the first statement, which says that Amy played tennis.\n\n3. If the consequent of the first statement is false, then the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) must also be false, according to the rules of logic.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'Jeff did not play basketball.'\n\nAnswer: yes"
