The first statement is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the consequent (Kate ate the salad) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Kate did not eat the salad.\" This contradicts the consequent of the first statement, which says that Kate ate the salad.\n\n3. If the consequent of the conditional statement is false, then the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) must also be false. This is because the conditional statement is true only when the antecedent is true and the consequent is true.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that 'Ben did not eat pasta.'\n\nAnswer: yes"
