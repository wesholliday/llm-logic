The first statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the consequent (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" This is the negation of the consequent from the first statement.\n\n3. Now, we need to consider the logical implications of these two statements. If the consequent of the first statement is false (Mark did not buy the blue shirt), then we can infer that the antecedent must also be false (Lisa did not buy the red shirt).\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
