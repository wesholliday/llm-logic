The first statement is: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"The robot did not visit Jupiter.\"\n3. We need to determine if the second statement allows us to infer the negation of the antecedent in the first statement, which is \"The alien did not visit Mars.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q.\" The second statement negates the consequent Q, which is \"The robot visited Jupiter.\"\n\nIn a conditional statement, if the consequent is false, we can infer that the antecedent is also false. This is known as the principle of modus tollens.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The alien did not visit Mars.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
