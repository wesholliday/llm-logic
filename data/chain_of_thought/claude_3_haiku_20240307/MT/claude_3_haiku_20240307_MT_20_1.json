This means that it only makes a claim about the relationship between the redness of the apple and the yellowness of the banana, but does not make any direct claims about the actual color of the apple or the banana.\n\nThe second statement, \"The banana was not yellow,\" is a negation of the consequent in the first statement. This means that the yellowness of the banana, which was the consequence in the first statement, is now being denied.\n\nNow, we need to consider the logical implications of these two statements. If the first statement is true, and the second statement is true, we can infer that the antecedent (the redness of the apple) must also be false. This is because the first statement claims that if the apple was red, then the banana must be yellow, and the second statement denies the yellowness of the banana, which means the antecedent (the redness of the apple) must also be false.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The apple was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
