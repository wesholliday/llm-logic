The first premise is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad. However, this does not necessarily mean that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat the salad.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Kate did not eat the salad.\" This directly contradicts the conclusion that would be drawn from the first premise, which is that Kate ate the salad.\n\n3. If we combine the two premises, we can see that the second premise, \"Kate did not eat the salad,\" contradicts the conclusion that would be drawn from the first premise, \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\" Therefore, we can infer that \"Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
