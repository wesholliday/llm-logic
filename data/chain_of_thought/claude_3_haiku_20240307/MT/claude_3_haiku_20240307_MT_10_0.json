The first statement is \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the cat was not outside, then the dog was inside.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The cat was not outside.\" This means that the cat was not outside, but it does not necessarily mean that the dog was inside.\n\n3. From the given information, we cannot infer that \"The dog was inside.\" The first statement only tells us that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside, but it does not tell us anything about the dog's location if the cat was not outside.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no"
