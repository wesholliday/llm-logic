The first premise is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This means that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Erin did not take a train.\" This means that Erin did not take a train.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the first premise again. If Erin did not take a train, then the \"if-then\" statement in the first premise must be false. This means that the antecedent, \"Sam took a plane,\" must also be false.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
