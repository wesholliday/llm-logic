            "content": "To answer this question, let's think through the logic step-by-step:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This means that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have also been in the forest.\n\n2. The second statement is a negation of the consequent of the first statement: \"The unicorn was not in the forest.\" This means that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\n3. From the first statement, we know that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest. However, the second statement tells us that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the griffin was also not in the forest. If the unicorn was not in the forest, and the griffin being in the forest implies the unicorn being in the forest, then the griffin must not have been in the forest either.\n\nAnswer: yes"
