This is a conditional statement, which means that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. However, the statement does not necessarily imply the converse, which would be 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic'.\n\nThe second statement is 'The truck was not metal'. This directly contradicts the conclusion that the truck was metal, which was implied by the first statement.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications. If the truck was not metal, and the first statement is true, then we can infer that the doll was not plastic. This is because the first statement says that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. Since the truck was not metal, we can conclude that the doll was not plastic.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer 'The doll was not plastic'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
