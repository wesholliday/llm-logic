The second premise is \"Amy did not play tennis.\" This directly contradicts the consequent of the first premise.\n\n3.

We are asked to determine if we can infer \"Jeff did not play basketball\" from these two premises.\n\nThe key to understanding this is the logical implication of the first premise. The first premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This means that if Jeff played basketball, the consequence is that Amy played tennis.\n\nHowever, the second premise tells us that Amy did not play tennis. This means that the consequence of the first premise (Amy playing tennis) did not occur.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the antecedent of the first premise (Jeff playing basketball) also did not occur. In other words, we can infer that \"Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
