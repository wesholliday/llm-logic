The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\"\n2. The second statement is a negation of the consequent of the first statement: \"The wolf was not in the den.\"\n3. From the rules of logic, if the consequent of a conditional statement is false, we can infer that the antecedent is also false.\n4. In this case, the consequent \"the wolf was in the den\" is false, so we can infer that the antecedent \"the bear was in the cave\" is also false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
