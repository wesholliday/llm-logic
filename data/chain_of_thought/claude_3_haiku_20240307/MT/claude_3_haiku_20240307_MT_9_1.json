However, the second statement tells us that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This means that the first statement (if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt) must be false.\n\n2.

The second premise is: \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n3. To infer \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt,\" we need to show that the first premise (if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt) and the second premise (Mark did not buy the blue shirt) cannot both be true at the same time.\n4. If the first premise is true, then it means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n5. However, the second premise tells us that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n6. Therefore, the first premise cannot be true, since it requires Mark to have bought the blue shirt, which we know he did not.\n7. So, if the first premise is false, then it means that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
