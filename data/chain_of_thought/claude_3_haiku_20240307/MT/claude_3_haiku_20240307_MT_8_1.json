The first premise is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This means that if the vampire was awake, the mummy was also awake.\n\n2. The second premise is \"The mummy was not awake.\" This means that the mummy was not in a state of being awake.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the first premise again. If the mummy was not awake, then the condition \"the mummy was awake\" in the first premise cannot be true. This means that the only way for the first premise to be true is if the vampire was not awake.\n\nTherefore, we can infer from the given information that \"The vampire was not awake.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
