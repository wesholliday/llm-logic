The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n2. The second statement is a negation of the consequent of the first statement: \"The mummy was not awake.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was also not awake. This is because the first statement tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake as well.\n4. Since the second statement tells us that the mummy was not awake, we can infer from the first statement that the vampire was also not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes"
