The first statement is 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.' This is a conditional statement, which means that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\n\n2. The second statement is 'The wolf was not in the den.' This means that the condition in the first statement is not true, as the wolf was not in the den.\n\n3. When the condition in a conditional statement is not true, we can conclude that the conclusion of the statement is also not true. In this case, since the wolf was not in the den, we can conclude that the bear was also not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes"

The second statement is \"The wolf was not in the den.\" This means that the wolf was not in the den, regardless of where the bear was.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical inference we can make:\n* If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den (from the first statement).\n* However, we know that the wolf was not in the den (from the second statement).\n* Therefore, we can conclude that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes"

The statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" is a conditional statement. It means that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. This can be represented logically as: \"Bear in cave \u21d2 Wolf in den\".\n\n2. The statement \"The wolf was not in the den\" is the negation of the consequent of the conditional statement. Logically, this can be represented as: \"~(Wolf in den)\".\n\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer \"The bear was not in the cave\" from the given information.\n\n4. Using the rule of modus tollens, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and the negation of the consequent \"~Q\", then we can infer the negation of the antecedent \"~P\".\n\n5. In this case, we have the conditional statement \"Bear in cave \u21d2 Wolf in den\" and the negation of the consequent \"~(Wolf in den)\". Therefore, we can infer the negation of the antecedent, which is \"~(Bear in cave)\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
