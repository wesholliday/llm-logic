The first statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequent (Jen watched basketball) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Jen did not watch basketball.\" This is the negation of the consequent in the first statement.\n\n3. Now, we can use the principle of modus tollens, which states that if the consequent of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent must also be false.\n\n4. Since the consequent \"Jen watched basketball\" is false (Jen did not watch basketball), we can infer that the antecedent \"Tom watched football\" must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
