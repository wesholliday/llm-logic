The first statement is: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This statement establishes a logical implication, which means that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have also finished the race.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Chris did not finish the race.\" This statement contradicts the conclusion that would be drawn from the first statement if Alex had finished the race.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the logical implications. If Chris did not finish the race, and the first statement is true, then it must be the case that Alex also did not finish the race. This is because the first statement implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have also finished the race.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'Alex did not finish the race.'\n\nAnswer: yes"
