The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\n2. The second statement is the negation of the consequent of the first statement: \"The pants were not denim.\"\n3. From the rules of logic, when we have a conditional statement and the negation of the consequent, we can infer the negation of the antecedent.\n4. In this case, the antecedent is \"the shirt was cotton,\" and the negation of the antecedent is \"the shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
