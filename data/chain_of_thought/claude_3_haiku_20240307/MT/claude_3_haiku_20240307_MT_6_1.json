This means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob's choice must have been pasta.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Bob did not choose pasta\". This means that Bob's choice was not pasta.\n\n3. Now, we need to consider the implications of these two statements. If Bob did not choose pasta, then the first statement (\"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\") must be false. This means that either Sue did not choose pizza, or if she did, then Bob did not choose pasta.\n\n4. Therefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"Sue did not choose pizza\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
