This means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n2. The second statement is \"Bob did not choose pasta\". This means that Bob did not choose pasta.\n3. Now, let's consider the first statement again. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. But we know from the second statement that Bob did not choose pasta.\n4. Therefore, the only way for both statements to be true is if Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes"
