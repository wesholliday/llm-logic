The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n2. The second statement is the negation of the consequent of the first statement: \"The truck was not metal.\"\n3. From the rules of logic, if the consequent of a conditional statement is false, we can infer that the antecedent is also false.\n4. In this case, the consequent \"the truck was metal\" is false, so we can infer that the antecedent \"the doll was plastic\" is also false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
