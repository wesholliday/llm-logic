We are given the statement 'The smonk might not be plagged'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled'.\n3. The second statement tells us that the smonk must either be plagged or vreebled. It cannot be both.\n4. The first statement tells us that the smonk might not be plagged.\n5. If the smonk might not be plagged, then the only other possibility is that it is vreebled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The smonk is vreebled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
