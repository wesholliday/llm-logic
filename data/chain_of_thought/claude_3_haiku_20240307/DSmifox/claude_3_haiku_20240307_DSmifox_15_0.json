The first premise is 'The dreb might not be spened'. This means that it is possible that the dreb is not spened.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed'. This means that the dreb must either be spened or vroombed.\n\n3. Since the first premise states that the dreb might not be spened, and the second premise states that the dreb must either be spened or vroombed, we can infer that the dreb must be vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
