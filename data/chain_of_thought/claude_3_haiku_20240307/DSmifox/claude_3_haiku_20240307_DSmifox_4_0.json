The first premise states that 'The fribble might not be crinked'.\n2. The second premise states 'Either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled'.\n3. From the second premise, we can infer that if the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled.\n4. Since the first premise states that the fribble might not be crinked, we can conclude that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
