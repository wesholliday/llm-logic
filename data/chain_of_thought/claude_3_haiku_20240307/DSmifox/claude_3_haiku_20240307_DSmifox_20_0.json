This means that it is possible that the fleeg is not surned.\n\n2. The second statement is 'Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered'. This means that the fleeg must either be surned or bluttered.\n\n3. Since the first statement says the fleeg might not be surned, and the second statement says the fleeg must either be surned or bluttered, we can infer that the fleeg must be bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes"
