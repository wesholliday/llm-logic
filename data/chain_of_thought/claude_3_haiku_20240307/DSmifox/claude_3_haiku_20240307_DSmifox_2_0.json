The first premise is 'The wug might not be bimmed'. This means that it is possible that the wug is not bimmed.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the wug must be bimmed or it is flooped'. This means that the wug must either be bimmed or it is flooped.\n\n3. Since the first premise states that the wug might not be bimmed, and the second premise states that the wug must either be bimmed or flooped, we can infer that the wug must be flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes"
