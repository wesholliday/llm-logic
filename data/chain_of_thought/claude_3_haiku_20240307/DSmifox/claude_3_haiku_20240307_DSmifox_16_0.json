We are given the following two premises:\n   - \"The sneg might not be sproted\"\n   - \"Either the sneg must be sproted or it is crampled\"\n\n2. From the first premise, we can infer that it is possible that the sneg is not sproted.\n\n3. The second premise tells us that there are two possible states for the sneg: either it is sproted, or it is crampled.\n\n4. Since we know from the first premise that the sneg might not be sproted, the only other possibility is that the sneg is crampled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
