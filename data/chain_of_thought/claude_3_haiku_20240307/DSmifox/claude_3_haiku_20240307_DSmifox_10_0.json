The first premise is 'The wug might not be garpled'. This means that it is possible that the wug is not garpled.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged'. This means that the wug must either be garpled or sproinged, but not both.\n\n3. From the first premise, we know that it is possible that the wug is not garpled. This means that the wug must be sproinged, since the second premise states that the wug must either be garpled or sproinged.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that 'The wug is sproinged'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
