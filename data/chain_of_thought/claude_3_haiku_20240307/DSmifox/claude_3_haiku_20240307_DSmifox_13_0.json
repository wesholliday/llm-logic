The first statement is 'The glip might not be tragged'. This means that it is possible that the glip is not tragged.\n\n2. The second statement is 'Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged'. This means that the glip must either be tragged or slogged, but not both.\n\n3. Since the first statement says the glip might not be tragged, and the second statement says the glip must either be tragged or slogged, we can infer that the glip must be slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
