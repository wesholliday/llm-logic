The first premise is 'The flob might not be movated'.\n2. The second premise is 'Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled'.\n3. From the first premise, we know that it is possible that 'the flob is not movated'.\n4. The second premise states that if the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled.\n5.
