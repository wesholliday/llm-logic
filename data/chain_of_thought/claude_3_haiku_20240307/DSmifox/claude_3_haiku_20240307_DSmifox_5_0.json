We are given the statement 'The zinger might not be smoogled'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled'.\n3. The second statement tells us that the zinger must either be smoogled or fraggled. It cannot be both.\n4. The first statement tells us that the zinger might not be smoogled.\n5. If the zinger might not be smoogled, then the only other possibility is that it is fraggled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The zinger is fraggled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
