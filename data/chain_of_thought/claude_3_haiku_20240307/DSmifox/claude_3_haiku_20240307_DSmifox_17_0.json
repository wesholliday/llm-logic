The first premise is 'The flob might not be movated'. This means that it is possible that the flob is not movated.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled'. This means that the flob must either be movated or it is skizzled.\n\n3. Since the first premise states that the flob might not be movated, and the second premise states that the flob must either be movated or skizzled, we can infer that the flob must be skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
