We are given the statement 'The shank might not be nugged'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked'.\n3. The second statement tells us that the shank must either be nugged or plooked. It does not allow for the possibility that the shank is neither nugged nor plooked.\n4. The first statement, 'The shank might not be nugged', suggests that the shank is not nugged.\n5. Therefore, if the shank is not nugged, and it must either be nugged or plooked, then the shank must be plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
