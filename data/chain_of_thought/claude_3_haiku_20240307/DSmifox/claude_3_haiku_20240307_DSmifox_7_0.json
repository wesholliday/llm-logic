The first premise is 'The whiffle might not be tinked'. This means that it is possible that the whiffle is not tinked.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked'. This means that the whiffle must either be tinked or shanked, with no other possibilities.\n\n3. From the first premise, we know that it is possible that the whiffle is not tinked. \n\n4. From the second premise, we know that if the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be shanked.\n\n5. Therefore, if the whiffle might not be tinked, and if it must either be tinked or shanked, then we can infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
