The first premise states that 'The flug might not be zimmed'. This means that it is possible that the flug is not zimmed.\n\n2. The second premise states 'Either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed'. This means that the flug must either be zimmed or blummed, but not both.\n\n3. Since the first premise states that the flug might not be zimmed, and the second premise states that the flug must either be zimmed or blummed, we can infer that the flug must be blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
