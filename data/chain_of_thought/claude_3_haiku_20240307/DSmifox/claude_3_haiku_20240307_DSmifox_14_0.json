The first premise states that 'The clug might not be snugged'.\n2. The second premise states 'Either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked'.\n3. From the second premise, we can infer that if the clug is not snugged, then it must be fleeked.\n4. Since the first premise states that 'The clug might not be snugged', we can conclude that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
