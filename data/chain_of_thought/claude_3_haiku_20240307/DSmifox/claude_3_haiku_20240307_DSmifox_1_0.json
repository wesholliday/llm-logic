The first premise is 'The flugel might not be zargled'. This means that it is possible that the flugel is not zargled.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed'. This means that the flugel must either be zargled or blimmed, with no other possibilities.\n\n3. Since the first premise states that the flugel might not be zargled, and the second premise states that the flugel must either be zargled or blimmed, we can infer that the flugel must be blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
