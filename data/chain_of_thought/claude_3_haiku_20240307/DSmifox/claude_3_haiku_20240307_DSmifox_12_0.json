The first statement is 'The smip might not be lupped'. This means that it is possible that the smip is not lupped.\n\n2. The second statement is 'Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped'. This means that the smip must either be lupped or it is shripped.\n\n3. Since the first statement says the smip might not be lupped, and the second statement says the smip must either be lupped or shripped, we can infer that the smip must be shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes"
