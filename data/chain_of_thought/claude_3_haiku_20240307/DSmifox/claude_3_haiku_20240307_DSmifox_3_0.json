The first premise is 'The splat might not be quanked'.\n2. The second premise is 'Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed'.\n3. The second premise is a disjunction, meaning that either the splat is quanked or it is morphed.\n4. The first premise tells us that the splat might not be quanked.\n5. If the splat might not be quanked, then the only other possibility from the second premise is that the splat is morphed.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that 'The splat is morphed'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
