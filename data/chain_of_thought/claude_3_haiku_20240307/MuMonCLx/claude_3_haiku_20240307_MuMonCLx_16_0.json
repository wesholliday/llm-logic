It is a made-up phrase that does not have any logical or factual basis. \n\nSince the original statement is a completely fabricated and meaningless sentence, we cannot infer any specific information from it. The phrase \"The snizzle must be quimble zump\" is just as arbitrary and devoid of meaning as the full original statement.\n\nWithout any context or logical structure to the original statement, there is no way to determine whether the part \"The snizzle must be quimble zump\" can be inferred from the full statement. The entire sentence is simply a collection of made-up words that do not convey any real meaning.\n\nAnswer: no"
