The first part, \"The wobble must be zooble flim,\" is a standalone statement that can be evaluated independently.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The wobble must be zooble flim\" from the given statement, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two parts of the compound statement. Since the given statement is a conjunction of two clauses, the inference \"The wobble must be zooble flim\" can be made because it is one of the parts of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
