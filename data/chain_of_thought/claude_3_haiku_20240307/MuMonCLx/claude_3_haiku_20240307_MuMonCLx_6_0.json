It is a made-up sentence with made-up words. Since the statement does not have any clear meaning or logical structure, it is not possible to infer any specific information from it. The phrase \"The quimble must be bimboozle wobble\" is a subset of the original statement, but without any context or meaning, there is no way to determine if this inference is valid or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
