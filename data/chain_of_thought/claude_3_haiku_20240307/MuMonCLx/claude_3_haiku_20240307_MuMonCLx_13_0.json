The statement only indicates that the flimble is in both frozz and zibber bimboozle, but it does not specify whether the flimble is necessarily in frozz alone. Without additional context or information, we cannot conclude that the flimble must be in frozz based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
