The converse is a separate logical statement that may or may not be true.\n\nIn this case, we cannot infer that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red, based solely on the given information. The original statement only tells us that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow, but it does not necessarily mean that the reverse is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
