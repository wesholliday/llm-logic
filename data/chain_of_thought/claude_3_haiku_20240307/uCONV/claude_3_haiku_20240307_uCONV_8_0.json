However, this does not necessarily mean that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was also awake.\n\nThe logical relationship between the two statements is not symmetric. The given statement only tells us that the vampire being awake implies the mummy being awake, but it does not tell us anything about the reverse implication.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: no"
