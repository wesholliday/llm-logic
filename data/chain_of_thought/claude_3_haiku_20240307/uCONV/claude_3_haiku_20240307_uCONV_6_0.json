The question is asking whether we can infer that \"if Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza.\"\n3. This is a logical statement that needs to be evaluated.\n4. The given information is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\" This means that if the condition A (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the consequence B (Bob chose pasta) is also true.\n5. However, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. The converse of \"If A, then B\" is \"If B, then A.\" This means that just because Bob chose pasta, we cannot automatically infer that Sue chose pizza.\n6. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"if Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
