            "content": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThis statement can be expressed in symbolic logic as:\nIf (Lisa bought the red shirt), then (Mark bought the blue shirt).\nIn other words, the statement is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and the consequent is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe question is asking whether we can infer that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nThis is the inverse of the original statement, which can be expressed as:\nIf (Mark bought the blue shirt), then (Lisa bought the red shirt).\n\nThe issue is that the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true, even if the original statement is true. This is because the original statement only tells us that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent is true, but it does not tell us anything about the converse relationship.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no"
