            "content": "To determine if we can infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding, we need to analyze the given information and the logical implications.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThis statement is in the form of a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and the consequent is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe question is asking whether we can infer the converse of the original statement, which would be: \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we need to consider the logical relationship between the original statement and its converse.\n\nIn general, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true, even if the original statement is true. The converse is a separate statement that may or may not be true.\n\nIn this case, the original statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" does not necessarily imply the converse \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no"
