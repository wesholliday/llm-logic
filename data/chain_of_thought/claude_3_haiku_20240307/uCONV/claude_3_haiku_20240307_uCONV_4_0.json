In other words, the truth of the original statement does not necessarily imply the truth of its converse.\n\nIn this case, the given information does not provide enough information to determine the truth of the converse. The fact that the alien visited Mars and the robot visited Jupiter does not necessarily mean that if the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: no"
