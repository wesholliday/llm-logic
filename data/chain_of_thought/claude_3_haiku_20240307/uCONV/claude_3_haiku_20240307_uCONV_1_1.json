In other words, if Mary was at the wedding, then it must be true that Sue was also at the wedding.\n\nThe question now asks if we can infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe original statement, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" does not imply that \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\" This is because the original statement only tells us that the presence of Sue is dependent on the presence of Mary, but it does not tell us that the presence of Mary is dependent on the presence of Sue.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no"
