This is because the logical relationship between the antecedent and the consequent does not necessarily work in the opposite direction.\n\nIn this case, the given statement does not provide enough information to infer the converse. It is possible that Amy played tennis for reasons unrelated to Jeff playing basketball, or that Jeff played basketball for reasons unrelated to Amy playing tennis.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: no"
