The converse may or may not be true, depending on the specific situation.\n\nIn this case, we cannot infer that if the cat was outside, then the dog was inside. The original statement only tells us that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside, but it does not necessarily mean that the reverse is true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no"
