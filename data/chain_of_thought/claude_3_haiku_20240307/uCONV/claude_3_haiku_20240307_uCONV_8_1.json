This means that the statement is true if the antecedent (the vampire was awake) is true, and the consequent (the mummy was awake) is also true.\n\nHowever, the converse of a conditional statement is not automatically true. The converse of a conditional statement is a different statement that has the antecedent and consequent reversed, i.e., \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.\"\n\nIn general, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true, even if the original statement is true. This is because the logical relationship between the antecedent and consequent may not be reversible.\n\nIn this case, without additional information, we cannot infer that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.
