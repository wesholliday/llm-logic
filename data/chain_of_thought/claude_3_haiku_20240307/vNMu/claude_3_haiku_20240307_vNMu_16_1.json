This means that the pen is not necessarily in the bag.\n\nThe conclusion states that the pen might not be in the bag. This conclusion follows directly from the premise, as the fact that the pen is not necessarily in the bag implies that it might not be in the bag.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
