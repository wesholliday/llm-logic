This means that the book might have been written by someone else, or it might not have been written by James.\n\nThe conclusion, \"The book might not have been written by James,\" follows logically from the premise. If it is not the case that the book must have been written by James, then it is possible that the book might not have been written by James.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
