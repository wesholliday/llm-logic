The robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n1. If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter (according to the first statement).\n2. However, the second statement tells us that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n3. This means that the first statement's condition, \"if the alien visited Mars,\" must be false.\n4. If the condition \"if the alien visited Mars\" is false, then we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes"
