The second statement is: \"Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n3. We need to determine if we can infer that \"Tom did not watch football\" from these two statements.\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n- If Tom watched football, then Jen should have watched basketball (according to the first statement).\n- However, the second statement tells us that Jen did not watch basketball.\n- This means that the first statement, \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball,\" must be false.\n- If the first statement is false, then we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes"
