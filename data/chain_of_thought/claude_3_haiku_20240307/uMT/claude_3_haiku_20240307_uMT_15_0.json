The second statement is: \"Erin did not take a train.\"\n3. We need to determine if we can infer that \"Sam did not take a plane\" from these two statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Sam took a plane) is true, then the second part (Erin took a train) must also be true.\n\nHowever, the second statement tells us that the second part of the conditional statement is not true (Erin did not take a train).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the first part of the conditional statement must also not be true, which means that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes"
