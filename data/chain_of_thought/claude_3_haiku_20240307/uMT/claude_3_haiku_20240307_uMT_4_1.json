If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n2. The robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nStep 1: Examine the first statement.\nIf the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\nThis statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If A, then B.\"\n\nStep 2: Consider the second statement.\nThe robot did not visit Jupiter.\nThis means that the condition \"B\" in the first statement is false.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the relationship between the conditional statement and the false condition.\nSince the condition \"B\" is false, we can conclude that the condition \"A\" must also be false.\nThis is because the first statement is a conditional statement, and if the conclusion is false, the premise must also be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes"

This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the alien visited Mars) is true, then the consequent (the robot visited Jupiter) must also be true.\n\n4) However, we know from statement (b) that the consequent (the robot visited Jupiter) is false.
