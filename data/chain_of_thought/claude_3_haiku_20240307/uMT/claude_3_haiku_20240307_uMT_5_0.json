The second statement is: \"Amy did not play tennis.\"\n3. We need to determine if we can infer that \"Jeff did not play basketball\" from these two statements.\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n- If Jeff played basketball, then the first statement tells us that Amy played tennis. However, the second statement tells us that Amy did not play tennis, which is a contradiction.\n- If Jeff did not play basketball, then the first statement does not provide any information about whether Amy played tennis or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes"
