However, this does not necessarily imply that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\n\nThe second statement is: \"The banana was not yellow.\" This contradicts the first statement, which said that the banana was yellow if the apple was red.\n\nGiven the contradiction between the two statements, we can infer that the original premise \"the apple was red\" is not true. In other words, we can conclude that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"

The second statement is \"the banana was not yellow.\" This contradicts the first statement, which said that the banana was yellow.\n\n3. The question is asking if we can infer that the apple was not red. This is asking us to negate the first part of the conditional statement, which is the \"if\" part.\n\nGiven the contradictory statements, we can infer that the original premise \"if the apple was red\" is not true, and therefore, the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
