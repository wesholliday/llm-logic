Erin did not take a train.\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. If Sam took a plane, then according to the first statement, Erin should have taken a train. However, the second statement tells us that Erin did not take a train. This creates a contradiction.\n2. If Sam did not take a plane, then the first statement does not apply, and there is no conflict with the second statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes"

Now, let's consider the logical implications of these two statements:\n   - If the first statement is true, then the second statement contradicts it.

Contraposition states that if the statement \"if A, then B\" is true, then the statement \"if not B, then not A\" is also true.\n\nIn this case, the statement \"if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is true.
