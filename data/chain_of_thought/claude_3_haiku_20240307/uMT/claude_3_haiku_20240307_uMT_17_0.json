The first statement is: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the second part (Kate ate salad) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Kate did not eat salad.\" This contradicts the second part of the first statement, which said that Kate ate salad.\n\n3. Since the second statement contradicts the second part of the first statement, we can infer that the first part of the first statement (Ben ate pasta) must be false.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
