The wolf was not in the den.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these statements:\n\nIf the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den (according to the first statement). However, the second statement tells us that the wolf was not in the den.\n\nThis means that the first statement, \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den,\" cannot be true, as the wolf was not in the den.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes"
