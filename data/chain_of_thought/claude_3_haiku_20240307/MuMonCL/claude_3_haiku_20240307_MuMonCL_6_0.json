            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The concert must have been sold out' from the given statement 'The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two parts of the statement.\n\nThe statement 'The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM' is a compound statement, where the two parts are connected by the conjunction 'and'. This means that both parts of the statement must be true for the entire statement to be true.\n\nHowever, the question is asking if we can infer the first part of the statement, 'The concert must have been sold out', from the entire statement. This means that we need to determine if the first part of the statement is necessarily true given the entire statement.\n\nSince the statement is a compound statement, the first part, 'The concert must have been sold out', is a necessary condition for the entire statement to be true. In other words, if the concert was not sold out, then the entire statement would be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The concert must have been sold out' from the given statement 'The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
