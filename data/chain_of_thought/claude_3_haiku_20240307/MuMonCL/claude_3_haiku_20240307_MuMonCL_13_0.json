            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The movie must have been in English' from the given statement 'The movie must have been in English and had subtitles', we need to consider the logical relationship between the two parts of the statement.\n\nThe statement 'The movie must have been in English and had subtitles' is a compound statement that consists of two parts connected by the conjunction 'and'. This means that both parts of the statement must be true for the entire statement to be true.\n\nIf the movie was in English and had subtitles, then it follows that the movie must have been in English. This is because the presence of subtitles implies that the movie was not in the viewer's native language, which in this case would be English.\n\nTherefore, from the given statement, we can infer that 'The movie must have been in English'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
