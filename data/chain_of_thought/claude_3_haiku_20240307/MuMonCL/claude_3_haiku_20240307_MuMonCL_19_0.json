            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is \"The application must have been completed online and included references\". This is a compound statement that consists of two parts connected by the conjunction \"and\".\n\nThe first part of the statement is \"The application must have been completed online\". The second part is \"and included references\".\n\nTo infer that \"The application must have been completed online\" from the given statement, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two parts of the statement.\n\nSince the two parts are connected by the conjunction \"and\", this means that both conditions must be true for the overall statement to be true. In other words, the application must have been completed online and it must have included references.\n\nTherefore, if the given statement is true, we can infer that the first part, \"The application must have been completed online\", is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
