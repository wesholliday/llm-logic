            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The room must have been cleaned daily and had fresh towels\" contains two parts: 1) \"The room must have been cleaned daily\" and 2) \"and had fresh towels\". The question is asking whether we can infer the first part, \"The room must have been cleaned daily\", from the given statement.\n\nSince the statement explicitly states that \"The room must have been cleaned daily and had fresh towels\", we can directly infer that the room must have been cleaned daily. The presence of the conjunction \"and\" indicates that both parts of the statement are true, and the first part is directly stated.\n\nAnswer: yes"
