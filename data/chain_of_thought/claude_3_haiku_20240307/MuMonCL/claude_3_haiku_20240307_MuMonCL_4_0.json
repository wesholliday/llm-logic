This means that both of these statements are true for the given situation.\n\nSince the first clause, 'The meeting must have been at 2 PM', is one of the conjuncts in the original statement, we can infer that this statement is true. The fact that the meeting must have been at 2 PM is directly stated in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
