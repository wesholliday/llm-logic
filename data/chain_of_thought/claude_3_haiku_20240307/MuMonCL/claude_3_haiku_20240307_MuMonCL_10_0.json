This means that the act of notarization necessarily includes the act of signing the document.\n\nTherefore, if we can infer from the given statement that the document must have been signed and notarized, we can also infer that the document must have been signed, as the act of signing is a prerequisite for the document to be notarized.\n\nAnswer: yes"
