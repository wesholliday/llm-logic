            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for\" contains two parts: \"The package must have been delivered today\" and \"and signed for\". \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The package must have been delivered today\" from this statement, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two parts.\n\nThe use of the word \"and\" in the statement indicates that both conditions must be true for the overall statement to be true. In other words, the package must have been delivered today and it must have been signed for.\n\nTherefore, if the overall statement is true, we can infer that the first part, \"The package must have been delivered today\", is also true. This is because the delivery of the package today is a necessary condition for the overall statement to be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
