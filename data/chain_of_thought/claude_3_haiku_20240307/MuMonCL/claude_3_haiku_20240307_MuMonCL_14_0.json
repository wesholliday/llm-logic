            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The contract must have been valid for a year' from the given statement 'The contract must have been valid for a year and renewable', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two parts of the statement.\n\nThe statement 'The contract must have been valid for a year and renewable' implies that the contract had two characteristics:\n1. It was valid for a year.\n2. It was renewable.\n\nThe phrase 'and renewable' indicates that the contract had an additional characteristic beyond just being valid for a year. This means that the first part of the statement, 'The contract must have been valid for a year', is a necessary condition for the overall statement to be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The contract must have been valid for a year' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
