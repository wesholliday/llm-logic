The first statement says that \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part is true (Lisa bought the red shirt), then the second part is also true (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n\n2. The second statement says that \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\" This means the first part of the conditional statement is true.\n\n3.
