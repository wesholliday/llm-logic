However, this does not necessarily mean that if the cake was chocolate, the muffins were always blueberry.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the cake was chocolate. This satisfies the condition in the first statement, which means that the muffins were blueberry.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the muffins were blueberry.\n\nAnswer: yes"
