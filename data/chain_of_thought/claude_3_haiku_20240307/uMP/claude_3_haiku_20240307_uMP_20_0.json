However, this does not necessarily mean that if the apple was red, the banana was always yellow.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the apple was red. This means that the condition in the first statement is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that the banana was yellow. Since the first statement is a conditional statement, and the condition (the apple was red) is true, we can conclude that the consequence (the banana was yellow) is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the banana was yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes"
