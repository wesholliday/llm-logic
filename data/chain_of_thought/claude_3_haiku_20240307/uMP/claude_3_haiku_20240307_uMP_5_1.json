The first premise is: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n2. The second premise is: \"Jeff played basketball.\" This is the \"A\" part of the conditional statement.\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer that \"Amy played tennis\" (the \"B\" part of the conditional statement).\n4. In a valid logical inference, when the \"A\" part of a conditional statement is true, we can conclude that the \"B\" part is also true.\n5. Since the first premise is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis,\" and the second premise is that \"Jeff played basketball,\" we can conclude that \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"

This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the consequent (Amy playing tennis) is also true.\n\nSince the second statement tells us that Jeff did, in fact, play basketball, we can apply the conditional statement and conclude that Amy played tennis.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
