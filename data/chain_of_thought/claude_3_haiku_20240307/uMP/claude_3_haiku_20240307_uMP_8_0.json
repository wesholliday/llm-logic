However, this does not necessarily mean that if the vampire was awake, the mummy was definitely awake.\n\nThe second statement is: \"The vampire was awake.\" This means that the condition in the first statement is true, i.e., the vampire was awake.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that the mummy was awake based on the given information.\n\nSince the first statement says that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake, and the second statement confirms that the vampire was awake, we can logically conclude that the mummy was also awake.\n\nAnswer: yes"
