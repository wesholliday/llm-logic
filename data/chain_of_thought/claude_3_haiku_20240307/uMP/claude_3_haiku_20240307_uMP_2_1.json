This means that the presence of the griffin in the forest implies the presence of the unicorn in the forest.\n\n2. The second statement tells us that the griffin was in the forest.\n\n3. Since the first statement tells us that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest, and the second statement confirms that the griffin was in the forest, we can logically infer that the unicorn was also in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes"
