Tom watched football.\n\nThe question is asking whether we can infer that Jen watched basketball.\n\nTo determine this, we need to look at the first statement, which is a conditional statement in the form of \"If A, then B\".\n\nSince the condition \"If Tom watched football\" is true (given in the second statement), we can apply the rule of modus ponens to conclude that the consequent \"Jen watched basketball\" is also true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Jen watched basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes"
