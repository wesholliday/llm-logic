This means that the condition in the first statement is true.\n\nSince the condition in the first statement is true, and the first statement is a conditional statement, we can infer that the conclusion of the first statement is also true. In other words, if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the wolf was in the den.\n\nAnswer: yes"
