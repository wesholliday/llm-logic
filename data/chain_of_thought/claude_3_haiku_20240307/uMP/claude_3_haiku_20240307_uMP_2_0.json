The griffin was in the forest.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the unicorn was in the forest, we need to apply the rule of modus ponens.\n\nThe rule of modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (if P, then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then we can conclude that the consequent (Q) is also true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" The antecedent (P) is \"The griffin was in the forest,\" which is given as true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the consequent (Q), \"The unicorn was in the forest,\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
