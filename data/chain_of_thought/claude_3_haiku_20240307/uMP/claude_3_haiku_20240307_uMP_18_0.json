However, this does not necessarily mean that if the doll was plastic, the truck was definitely metal.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the doll was plastic. This means that the condition in the first statement is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that the truck was metal based on the given information.\n\nSince the first statement is a conditional statement, and the condition (the doll was plastic) is true, we can conclude that the consequence (the truck was metal) is also true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the truck was metal.\n\nAnswer: yes"
