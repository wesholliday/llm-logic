The first statement is: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This means that if the dog was inside, the cat must have been outside.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The dog was inside.\" This means that the first part of the first statement is true, which is that the dog was inside.\n\n3.
