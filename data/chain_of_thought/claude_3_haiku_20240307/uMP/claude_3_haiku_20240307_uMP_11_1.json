The cake was chocolate.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the muffins were blueberry, we need to use the principles of logical reasoning.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. This does not necessarily mean that if the cake is chocolate, the muffins must be blueberry, but it does mean that if the cake is not chocolate, then the muffins cannot be blueberry.\n\nHowever, the second statement tells us that the cake was chocolate.
