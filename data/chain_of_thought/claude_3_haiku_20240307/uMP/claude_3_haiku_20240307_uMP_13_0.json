This statement does not imply that the truck was blue if the car was not red.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the car was red. This means that the condition in the first statement is true.\n\nNow, we can use the information from the first statement to infer that if the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n\nSince the car was red (as stated in the second statement), we can conclude that the truck was blue.\n\nAnswer: yes"
