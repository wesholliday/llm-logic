The first statement is: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"Also, the truck might not have been metal.\"\n3. The question is asking whether we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logic:\n- The first statement establishes a conditional relationship: if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n- The second statement introduces uncertainty about the material of the truck, stating that it \"might not have been metal.\"\n- Since the second statement contradicts the first statement's conclusion that the truck must have been metal, we cannot infer anything about the material of the doll.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: no"
