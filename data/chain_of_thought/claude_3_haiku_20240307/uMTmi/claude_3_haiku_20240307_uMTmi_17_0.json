The first statement is: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\" This means that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. It does not necessarily mean that if Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Kate might not have eaten salad.\" This contradicts the first statement, which said that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\n\n3. Since the second statement contradicts the first statement, we cannot infer that Ben did not eat pasta. The information provided is not sufficient to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
