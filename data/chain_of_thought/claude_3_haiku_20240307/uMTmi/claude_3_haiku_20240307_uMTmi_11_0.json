The first statement is: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Also, the muffins might not have been blueberry.\" This statement contradicts the first statement, as it suggests that the muffins might not have been blueberry, even though the first statement said they must have been blueberry if the cake was chocolate.\n\n3. Given the contradictory statements, we cannot infer that the cake was not chocolate. The first statement only tells us that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry, but it does not tell us anything about the cake if the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nAnswer: no"
