If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n2. The banana might not have been yellow.\n\nTo infer that the apple was not red, we need to find a contradiction in the information provided.\n\nThe first statement, \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow,\" does not lead to any contradiction when combined with the second statement, \"The banana might not have been yellow.\"\n\nThis is because the second statement does not necessarily negate the first statement. The second statement only suggests that the banana might not have been yellow, but it does not explicitly state that the banana was not yellow.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: no"
