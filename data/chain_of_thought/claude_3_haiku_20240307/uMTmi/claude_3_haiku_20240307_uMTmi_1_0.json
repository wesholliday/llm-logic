This means that if Mary was at the wedding, we can infer that Sue was also at the wedding.\n\nThe second statement, \"Sue might not have been at the wedding,\" contradicts the first statement. If Sue might not have been at the wedding, then it is possible that Sue was not at the wedding, even if Mary was.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer that Mary was not at the wedding?\"\n\nThe given information does not allow us to infer that Mary was not at the wedding. The first statement suggests that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there as well. However, the second statement introduces uncertainty about Sue's attendance, which means we cannot conclude that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no"
