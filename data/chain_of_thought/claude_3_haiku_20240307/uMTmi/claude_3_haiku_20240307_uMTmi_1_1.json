The first statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This means that if Mary was present, then Sue was also present. It does not tell us anything about whether Sue was present if Mary was not present.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Sue might not have been at the wedding.\" This means that it is possible that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding based on these two statements.\n\nThe first statement tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there. The second statement tells us that Sue might not have been there. However, this does not necessarily mean that Mary was not at the wedding. It is possible that both Mary and Sue were at the wedding, or that only Mary was at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from the given information that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no"

If the first statement is true (Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding), then the second statement (Sue might not have been at the wedding) cannot be true.\n\nGiven this contradiction, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding.
