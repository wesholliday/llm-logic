The second statement is: \"Also, the mummy might not have been awake.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake.\n4. However, the second statement contradicts the first one by saying that the mummy might not have been awake.\n5. Since the two statements are contradictory, we cannot infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: no"
