The first statement is: \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The banana might not have been yellow.\" This statement contradicts the first statement, which said that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n\n3. Since the second statement contradicts the first statement, we cannot infer that the apple was not red. The two statements are logically inconsistent, and there is not enough information to determine the color of the apple.\n\nAnswer: no"
