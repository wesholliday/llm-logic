This means that if the condition \"Jeff played basketball\" is true, then the conclusion \"Amy must have played tennis\" must also be true. However, this does not necessarily mean that the reverse is true. In other words, if Amy played tennis, it does not necessarily mean that Jeff played basketball.\n\nThe second statement, \"Amy might not have played tennis,\" contradicts the conclusion of the first statement, which says that \"Amy must have played tennis.\" This means that the first statement cannot be true if the second statement is also true.\n\nTherefore, if the second statement is true, then the first statement cannot be true, and we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes"
