The second statement is: \"Erin might not have taken a train.\"\n3. The question is asking whether we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nNow, let's reason through this:\n* If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train (according to the first statement).\n* However, the second statement says that Erin might not have taken a train.\n* This means that the first statement is not necessarily true. If Erin might not have taken a train, then it's possible that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: no"
