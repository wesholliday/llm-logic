However, this statement does not imply the reverse, which would be: \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton.\"\n\nThe second statement is: \"Also, the pants might not have been denim.\" This statement contradicts the first statement, which said that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\n\nSince the second statement contradicts the first statement, we cannot infer that the shirt was not cotton. The two statements are logically inconsistent, and there is not enough information to determine the material of the shirt.\n\nAnswer: no"
