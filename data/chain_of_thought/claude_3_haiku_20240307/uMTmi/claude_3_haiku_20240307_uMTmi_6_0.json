The first statement says: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\" This means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob's choice must have been pasta.\n\n2. The second statement says: \"Bob might not have chosen pasta.\" This means that it's possible that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the two statements together. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. However, the second statement says that Bob might not have chosen pasta. This means that it's possible that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: no"
