The first statement is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\" This means that it's possible that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's consider the two statements together:\n- If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n- But Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\n\nThese two statements are contradictory. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt, but the second statement says that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. The two statements provided are contradictory, and there is not enough information to determine whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
