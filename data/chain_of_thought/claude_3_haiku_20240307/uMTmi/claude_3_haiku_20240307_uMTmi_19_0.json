If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n2. Jen might not have watched basketball.\n\nThe key to answering this question is to understand the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequent (Jen must have watched basketball) must also be true.\n\nHowever, the second statement contradicts the consequent of the first statement. If Jen might not have watched basketball, then it cannot be true that Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nThis means that the first statement cannot be true, as it would lead to a contradiction with the second statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes"
