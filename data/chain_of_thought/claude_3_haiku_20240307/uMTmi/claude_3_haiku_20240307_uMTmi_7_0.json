The first statement is: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\" This means that if Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished the race.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Chris might not have finished the race.\" This means that it's possible that Chris did not finish the race.\n\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\n4. If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race (according to the first statement). However, the second statement says that Chris might not have finished the race, which contradicts the first statement.\n\n5. This contradiction means that the initial assumption, that Alex finished the race, cannot be true. Therefore, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes"
