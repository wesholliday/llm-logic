If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\n2. The book might not be a mystery novel.\n\nFrom this information, we cannot conclusively infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n1. The first statement tells us that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. This does not mean that all books written by James are mystery novels.\n2. The second statement tells us that the book might not be a mystery novel. This is not contradictory to the first statement, as it simply means that the book may or may not be a mystery novel, regardless of who the author is.\n\nSince the given information does not provide a definitive answer about the author of the book, we cannot infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: no"
