The second statement is \"the muffins might not have been blueberry.\" This contradicts the first statement, as it suggests that the muffins might not have been blueberry, even if the cake was chocolate.\n\n3. The question is asking whether we can infer that the cake was not chocolate. This would be the case if the two statements are contradictory.\n\nSince the second statement contradicts the first statement, we cannot infer that the cake was not chocolate. The two statements are logically inconsistent, and there is not enough information to determine the nature of the cake or the muffins.\n\nAnswer: no"

If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\n2. The muffins might not have been blueberry.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not necessarily blueberry. This is because the first statement establishes a conditional relationship between the cake being chocolate and the muffins being blueberry, but it does not imply the reverse.\n\nThe second statement further complicates the situation by introducing the possibility that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nConsidering both statements together, we cannot infer that the cake was not chocolate.
