The first statement is: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"Also, the book might not be a mystery novel.\"\n3. The question is asking whether we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logic:\n* If the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel (according to the first statement).\n* However, the second statement says that the book might not be a mystery novel.\n* This means that the first statement, \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel,\" is not necessarily true.\n* Therefore, we cannot infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: no"
