We are given two statements:\n   a) If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n   b) The unicorn might not have been in the forest.\n\n2. From statement (a), we can infer that if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was also not in the forest. This is because the statement is in the form of a conditional statement, and the contrapositive of a conditional statement is also true.\n\n3. Statement (b) tells us that the unicorn might not have been in the forest. This means that it's possible the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\n4.
