The original statement indicates that the quork is in the combination of \"wobble and zibble wumble\", but it does not specify that the quork is solely the \"zibble wumble\". There could be other elements or components that make up the \"wobble and zibble wumble\" besides just the \"zibble wumble\". Without more context or information, we cannot conclude that the quork is exclusively the \"zibble wumble\".\n\nAnswer: no"
