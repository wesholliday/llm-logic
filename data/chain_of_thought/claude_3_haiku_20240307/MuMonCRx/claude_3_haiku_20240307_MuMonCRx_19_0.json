The statement appears to be a nonsensical phrase with made-up words, and there is no logical connection or relationship between the two parts of the statement that would allow for such an inference. Without any context or defined meaning for the terms used, it is not possible to determine if the second part is a valid inference from the first part.\n\nAnswer: no"
