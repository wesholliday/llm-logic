The statement contains made-up words that do not have any clear meaning or logical relationship to each other. Without any context or defined meanings for the words, it is not possible to determine if the snizzle being zibble quank can be inferred from the original statement. The two statements are not logically connected, and there is no way to draw a valid inference from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
