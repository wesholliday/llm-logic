The statement indicates that the zump must be in two locations: \"quimble bimboozle\" and \"the gronk gronk\". However, it does not explicitly state that the zump must be solely in the gronk gronk. The statement suggests that the zump is in both locations, but it does not necessarily imply that the zump is only in the gronk gronk.\n\nAnswer: no"
