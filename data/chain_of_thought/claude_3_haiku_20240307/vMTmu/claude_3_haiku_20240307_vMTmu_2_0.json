            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following structure:\nPremise 1: If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\nPremise 2: It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\nConclusion: The griffin was not in the forest.\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we can use the principle of modus tollens, which states that if the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, then the consequent must also be false.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" The second premise states that the consequent of this conditional (i.e., \"the unicorn must have been in the forest\") is false.\n\nTherefore, by the principle of modus tollens, we can conclude that the antecedent of the conditional (i.e., \"the griffin was in the forest\") must also be false. This is exactly the conclusion stated in the argument.\n\nAnswer: yes"
