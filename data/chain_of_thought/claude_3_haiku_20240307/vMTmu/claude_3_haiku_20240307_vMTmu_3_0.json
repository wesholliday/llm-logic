            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe argument has the following structure:\nPremise 1: If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\nPremise 2: It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\nConclusion: The book was not written by James.\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity of this argument, we can use the principle of modus tollens, which states that if the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, then the consequent must also be false.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" The second premise states that it's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel, which means the consequent of the conditional statement is false.\n\nAccording to the principle of modus tollens, if the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false. Therefore, the conclusion \"The book was not written by James\" follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
