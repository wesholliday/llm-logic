            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\nPremise 2: It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\nConclusion: Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we can use the rules of propositional logic.\n\nThe first premise, \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta,\" can be represented as the conditional statement: P \u2192 Q, where P represents \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q represents \"Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\n\nThe second premise, \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta,\" can be represented as the negation of the second premise: \u00acQ.\n\nThe conclusion, \"Sue did not choose pizza,\" can be represented as the negation of the first premise: \u00acP.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical validity of the argument:\nIf the first premise is true (P \u2192 Q) and the second premise is true (\u00acQ), then we can logically conclude that the first premise must be false (\u00acP), which is the conclusion of the argument.\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of logical inference. The conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
