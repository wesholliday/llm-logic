            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe argument has the following structure:\nPremise 1: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\nPremise 2: It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\nConclusion: The vampire was not awake.\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we can use the principle of modus tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (if P, then Q) and the negation of the consequent (not Q), then we can validly conclude the negation of the antecedent (not P).\n\nIn this case, the first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" The second premise is the negation of the consequent: \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\" Therefore, we can validly conclude the negation of the antecedent: \"The vampire was not awake.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
