The first premise states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. This means that if the antecedent (Sam took a plane) is true, then the consequent (Erin must have taken a train) must also be true.\n\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that Erin must have taken a train. This means that the consequent from the first premise (Erin must have taken a train) is false.\n\n3. From the first premise, we know that if the antecedent (Sam took a plane) is true, then the consequent (Erin must have taken a train) must be true. However, the second premise tells us that the consequent is false.\n\n4. Therefore, the only way for the premises to be true and the conclusion to follow logically is if the antecedent (Sam took a plane) is also false.\n\nAnswer: yes"

This is the negation of the second part of the first premise.\n\n3) The conclusion is \"Sam did not take a plane\".\n\nNow, let's consider the logical validity of this argument. If the premises are true, and the argument is logically valid, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the first premise says that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. The second premise says that it's not the case that Erin must have taken a train. This means that the first part of the first premise (Sam took a plane) must be false, otherwise the second premise would be contradictory.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Sam did not take a plane\" follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
