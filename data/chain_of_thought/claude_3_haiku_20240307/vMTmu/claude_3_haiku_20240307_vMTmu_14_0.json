            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe argument has the following structure:\nPremise 1: If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\nPremise 2: It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den.\nConclusion: The bear was not in the cave.\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we can use the principle of contraposition. The contrapositive of the first premise is: \"If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the relationship between the premises and the conclusion:\n- Premise 2 states that it's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den.\n- The contrapositive of the first premise tells us that if the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\n- Therefore, the conclusion \"The bear was not in the cave\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
