Premise 1 states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequent (Sue must have been at the wedding) must also be true.\n2. Premise 2 states that it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This negates the consequent of the conditional statement in Premise 1.\n3. From Premise 1 and Premise 2, we can infer that the antecedent of the conditional statement in Premise 1 must be false. In other words, if the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion \"Mary was not at the wedding\" follows logically from the two premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
