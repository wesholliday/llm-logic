The first premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. This means that the condition \"Jeff played basketball\" is sufficient for the conclusion \"Amy must have played tennis.\"\n\n2. The second premise says that it is not the case that Amy must have played tennis. This is the negation of the conclusion in the first premise.\n\n3. Given the first and second premises, we can logically deduce that the condition \"Jeff played basketball\" must be false. If the condition were true, then the conclusion \"Amy must have played tennis\" would also be true, which contradicts the second premise.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Jeff did not play basketball\" follows necessarily from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
