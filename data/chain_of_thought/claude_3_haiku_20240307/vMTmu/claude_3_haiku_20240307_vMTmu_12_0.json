            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following structure:\nPremise 1: If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\nPremise 2: It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\nConclusion: Joe did not go to the park.\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we can use the principle of modus tollens, which states that if the first premise is a conditional statement (if P, then Q) and the second premise is the negation of the consequent (not Q), then the conclusion is the negation of the antecedent (not P).\n\nIn this case, the first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" The second premise is the negation of the consequent: \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" Therefore, the conclusion, \"Joe did not go to the park,\" follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
