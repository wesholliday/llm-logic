            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following structure:\nPremise 1: If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\nPremise 2: It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\nConclusion: The cake was not chocolate.\n\nLet's examine the logical validity of this argument:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This means that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\n2. The second premise is the negation of the consequent of the first premise: \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This means that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\n3. The conclusion, \"The cake was not chocolate,\" follows logically from the first two premises. If the first premise is true and the muffins were not blueberry (as stated in the second premise), then the cake could not have been chocolate.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
