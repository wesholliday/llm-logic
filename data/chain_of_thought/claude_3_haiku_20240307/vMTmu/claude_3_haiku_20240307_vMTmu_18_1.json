In other words, the doll being plastic is the sufficient condition for the truck being metal.\n\nThe second premise is: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\".\nThis is the negation of the conclusion in the first premise, which means that the truck was not metal.\n\nThe conclusion is: \"The doll was not plastic\".\nThis conclusion follows logically from the two premises.

The first premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the doll was plastic, then the truck being metal necessarily follows.\n\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the truck must have been metal. This means that the truck being metal is not a necessary condition.\n\n3. From these two premises, we can logically conclude that the doll was not plastic. This is because if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal (according to the first premise), but the second premise tells us that the truck being metal is not a necessary condition.
