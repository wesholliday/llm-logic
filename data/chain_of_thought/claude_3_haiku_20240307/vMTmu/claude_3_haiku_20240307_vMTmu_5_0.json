            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following structure:\nPremise 1: If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\nPremise 2: It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\nConclusion: Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nThis argument form is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of logical inference.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n1. If the first premise is true, then if Jeff played basketball, Amy must have played tennis.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\n3. Therefore, by Modus Tollens, we can conclude that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes"
