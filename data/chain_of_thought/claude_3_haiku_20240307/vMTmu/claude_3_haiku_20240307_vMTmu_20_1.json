The first premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. This is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between the redness of the apple and the yellowness of the banana.\n\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow. This premise contradicts the first premise, as it denies the consequent (the yellowness of the banana) of the conditional statement in the first premise.\n\n3. From the contradiction between the two premises, we can conclude that the antecedent (the apple being red) must also be false.
