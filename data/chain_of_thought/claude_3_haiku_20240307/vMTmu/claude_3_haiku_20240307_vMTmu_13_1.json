If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\n2. It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\n\nThe conclusion is:\nThe car was not red.\n\nLet's consider the structure of the argument:\n- The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\"\n- The second premise negates the consequent of the conditional statement: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\"\n\nAccording to the rules of propositional logic, the contrapositive of the first premise is: \"If the truck is not blue, then the car is not red.\" This is logically equivalent to the first premise.\n\nThe second premise directly contradicts the consequent of the first premise, which means the antecedent must be false. In other words, if the truck is not blue, then the car must not have been red.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid, as the conclusion \"The car was not red\" follows logically from the two premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
