            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following structure:\nPremise 1: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\nPremise 2: It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\nConclusion: Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nLet's consider the logical validity of this argument:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This means that if the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the consequent (Mark must have bought the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\n2. The second premise is the negation of the consequent of the first premise: \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This means that the consequent of the first premise is false.\n\n3. The conclusion, \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt,\" follows logically from the first two premises. If the consequent of the first premise is false, then the antecedent must also be false. In other words, if it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt, then it must be the case that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
