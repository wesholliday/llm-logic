            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following structure:\nPremise 1: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\nPremise 2: It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\nConclusion: Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nLet's examine the validity of this argument step by step:\n\n1. Premise 1 states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequent (Sue must have been at the wedding) must also be true.\n\n2. Premise 2 states that it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This is the negation of the consequent in Premise 1.\n\n3. The conclusion, \"Mary was not at the wedding,\" follows logically from the two premises. If the consequent in Premise 1 is false (i.e., Sue must not have been at the wedding), then the antecedent must also be false (i.e., Mary was not at the wedding).\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of logical reasoning. The conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
