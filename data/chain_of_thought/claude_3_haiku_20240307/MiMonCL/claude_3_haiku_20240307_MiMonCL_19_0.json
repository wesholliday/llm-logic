The first part, \"The election might be close,\" is a standalone statement that can be inferred from the original statement. The second part, \"require a recount,\" provides additional information about the potential closeness of the election.\n\nSince the original statement contains the first part, \"The election might be close,\" we can infer this statement from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
