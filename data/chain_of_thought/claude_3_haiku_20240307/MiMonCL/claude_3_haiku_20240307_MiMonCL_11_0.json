The key question is whether we can infer the first part, \"The athlete might be injured\", from the given statement.\n\nSince the statement explicitly mentions that the athlete \"might be injured\", this part of the statement can be directly inferred. The statement does not provide any additional information that would contradict or negate the possibility of the athlete being injured.\n\nAnswer: yes"
