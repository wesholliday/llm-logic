            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The contract might be legally binding and have hidden clauses\" contains two parts: 1) \"The contract might be legally binding\" and 2) \"and have hidden clauses\". The question is asking whether we can infer the first part, \"The contract might be legally binding\", from the given statement.\n\nSince the statement uses the phrase \"might be legally binding\", it suggests that the contract has the potential to be legally binding. The presence of the word \"might\" indicates that the legal binding nature of the contract is not a certainty, but a possibility.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the statement \"The contract might be legally binding and have hidden clauses\" implies that \"The contract might be legally binding\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
