The first part, 'The technology might be revolutionary', is a standalone statement that expresses the possibility of the technology being revolutionary. The second part, 'and change the industry', further describes the potential impact of the technology.\n\nSince the first part of the statement is a standalone statement, we can infer that 'The technology might be revolutionary' from the given statement. The additional information about the technology potentially changing the industry does not negate or contradict the first part of the statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
