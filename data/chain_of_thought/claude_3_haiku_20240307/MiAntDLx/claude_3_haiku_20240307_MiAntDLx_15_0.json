The question asks whether we can infer the first part of the statement, \"The wozzle might be zooble flonk blimp\", from the given statement.\n\nSince the original statement presents two possibilities connected by the word \"or\", we can infer that either of the two possibilities could be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The wozzle might be zooble flonk blimp\" is one of the possible statements that can be derived from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
