The original statement presents two possibilities for how the blurble might be blimple, either by zizz or by zazzle. Without additional context or information, we cannot conclude that the blurble is specifically blimple by zizz, as the statement leaves open the possibility that it could also be blimple by zazzle.\n\nAnswer: no"
