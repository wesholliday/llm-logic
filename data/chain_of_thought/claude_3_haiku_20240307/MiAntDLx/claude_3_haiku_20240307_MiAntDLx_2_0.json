This is because the statement \"The fribble might be on the blurble\" is one of the two possibilities presented in the original statement, and it is connected by the \"or\" operator, which means that at least one of the two possibilities is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The fribble might be on the blurble\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
