This means that the fribble must be either crinked or snurgled, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The fribble is not crinked\". This means that the fribble cannot be crinked.\n\n3. Therefore, since the fribble cannot be crinked and it must be either crinked or snurgled, the only remaining possibility is that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes"

The fribble is not crinked.\n\nLet's consider the two possible scenarios:\n1. If the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled, based on the first statement.\n2. If the fribble is not crinked, and it is not snurgled either, then the first statement would be false, which contradicts the given information.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical reasoning, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes"
