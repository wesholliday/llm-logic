The first statement is \"Either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled.\" This means that the smonk must be either plagged or vreebled, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The smonk is not plagged.\" This means that the smonk cannot be plagged.\n\n3. Since the smonk cannot be plagged, and it must be either plagged or vreebled, the only remaining possibility is that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The smonk is vreebled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
