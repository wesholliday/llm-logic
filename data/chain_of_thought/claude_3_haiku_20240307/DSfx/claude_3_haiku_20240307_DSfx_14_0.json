This means that the clug must be either snugged or fleeked, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The clug is not snugged\". This means that the clug is not snugged.\n\n3. Since the clug is not snugged, and it must be either snugged or fleeked, the only remaining possibility is that the clug is fleeked.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The clug is fleeked\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
