If the zinger is not smoogled, then it must be fraggled.\n2. If the zinger is both smoogled and fraggled, then since it is not smoogled, it must be fraggled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The zinger is fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"

The second premise is 'The zinger is not smoogled'. This negates the first part of the disjunction, leaving only the second part as a possibility.\n3.
