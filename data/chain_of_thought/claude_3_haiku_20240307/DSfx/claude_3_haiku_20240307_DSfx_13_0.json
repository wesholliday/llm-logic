This means that the glip can be either tragged or slogged, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The glip is not tragged\". This means that the glip is not tragged.\n\n3. Since the first statement says that the glip is either tragged or slogged, and the second statement says that the glip is not tragged, we can infer that the glip must be slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
