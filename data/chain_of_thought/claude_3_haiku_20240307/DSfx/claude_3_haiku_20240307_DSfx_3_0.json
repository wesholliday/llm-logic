The first statement is \"Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed.\" This means that the splat must be either quanked or morphed, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The splat is not quanked.\" This means that the splat cannot be quanked.\n\n3. Since the splat cannot be quanked (from the second statement), and it must be either quanked or morphed (from the first statement), the only remaining possibility is that the splat is morphed.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The splat is morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
