This means that the dreb can be in one of two states: spened or vroombed.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The dreb is not spened\". This means that the dreb cannot be in the spened state.\n\n3. Since the dreb cannot be in the spened state, and the first statement says it must be in either the spened or vroombed state, we can infer that the dreb must be in the vroombed state.\n\nAnswer: yes"
