The first statement is \"Either the shank is nugged or it is plooked.\" This means that the shank must be either nugged or plooked, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The shank is not nugged.\" This means that the shank cannot be nugged.\n\n3. Since the shank cannot be nugged, and it must be either nugged or plooked, then it must be plooked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The shank is plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"

The question asks whether we can infer from these two statements that \"The shank is plooked.\"\n\nThe first statement gives us two possibilities: either the shank is nugged or it is plooked.
