The first statement is 'Either the smip is lupped or it is shripped'. This means that the smip can be in one of two states: lupped or shripped.\n\n2. The second statement is 'The smip is not lupped'. This eliminates the possibility that the smip is lupped.\n\n3. Therefore, if the smip is not lupped, and the only two possibilities are that it is either lupped or shripped, then the only remaining possibility is that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes"
