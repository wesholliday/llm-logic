The first statement is \"Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked.\" This means that the sprocket can be in one of two states: either it is daggled or it is cranked.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The sprocket is not daggled.\" This means that the sprocket is not in the daggled state.\n\n3. Since the sprocket is not in the daggled state, and it can only be in one of two states (daggled or cranked), the only remaining possibility is that the sprocket is in the cranked state.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The sprocket is cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
