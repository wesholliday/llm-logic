The first statement, \"Either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed,\" gives us two possible states for the flugel: either it is zargled or it is blimmed.\n\n2. The second statement, \"The flugel is not zargled,\" tells us that the flugel is not in the zargled state.\n\n3. Since the flugel is not zargled, and the first statement gives us two possible states (zargled or blimmed), the only remaining possibility is that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The flugel is blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
