This means that the wug can be in one of two states: it is either garpled or sproinged.\n\n2. The second statement is 'The wug is not garpled.' This means that the wug is not in the 'garpled' state.\n\n3. Since the wug is not garpled, and the first statement says that it can only be in one of two states (garpled or sproinged), we can infer that the wug must be in the 'sproinged' state.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that 'The wug is sproinged.'\n\nAnswer: yes"
