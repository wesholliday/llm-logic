The first statement is \"Either the sneg is sproted or it is crampled.\" This means that the sneg can be in one of two states: sproted or crampled.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The sneg is not sproted.\" This means that the sneg is not in the sproted state.\n\n3. Since the sneg cannot be in the sproted state, and the first statement says it must be in either the sproted or crampled state, we can infer that the sneg must be in the crampled state.\n\nAnswer: yes"
