The first premise is \"Either the fribble is crinked or it is snurgled.\" This means that the fribble must be either crinked or snurgled, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is \"The fribble is not crinked.\" This means that the fribble cannot be crinked.\n\n3. Since the fribble cannot be crinked (from the second premise), and it must be either crinked or snurgled (from the first premise), the only remaining possibility is that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that \"The fribble is snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
