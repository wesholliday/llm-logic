The first statement is \"Either the wug is garpled or it is sproinged.\" This means that the wug must be either garpled or sproinged, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The wug is not garpled.\" This means that the wug cannot be garpled.\n\n3. Since the wug cannot be garpled (from the second statement), and it must be either garpled or sproinged (from the first statement), the only remaining possibility is that the wug is sproinged.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
