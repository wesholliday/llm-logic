The first statement is \"Either the flug is zimmed or it is blummed.\" This means that the flug must be either zimmed or blummed, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The flug is not zimmed.\" This means that the flug cannot be zimmed.\n\n3. Since the flug cannot be zimmed, and it must be either zimmed or blummed, the only remaining possibility is that the flug is blummed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The flug is blummed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
