The first statement is \"Either the fleeg is surned or it is bluttered.\" This means that the fleeg is either surned or bluttered, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The fleeg is not surned.\" This means that the fleeg is not surned.\n\n3. From the first statement, we know that if the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
