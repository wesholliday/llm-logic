The first statement is \"Either the shank is nugged or it is plooked.\" This means that the shank can be in one of two states: nugged or plooked.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The shank is not nugged.\" This means that the shank is not in the nugged state.\n\n3. Since the shank cannot be in the nugged state, and it can only be in one of the two states (nugged or plooked), the only remaining possibility is that the shank is plooked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The shank is plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
