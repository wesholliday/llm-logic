This means that the smip must be either lupped or shripped, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The smip is not lupped\". This means that the smip cannot be lupped.\n\n3. Since the smip cannot be lupped, and it must be either lupped or shripped, the only remaining possibility is that the smip is shripped.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The smip is shripped\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
