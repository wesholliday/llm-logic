The first statement is \"Either the whiffle is tinked or it is shanked.\" This means that the whiffle must be either tinked or shanked, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The whiffle is not tinked.\" This means that the whiffle cannot be tinked.\n\n3. Since the whiffle cannot be tinked, and it must be either tinked or shanked, the only remaining possibility is that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The whiffle is shanked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
