The first statement is \"Either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed.\" This means that the flugel can be in one of two states: zargled or blimmed.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The flugel is not zargled.\" This means that the flugel is not in the zargled state.\n\n3. Since the flugel cannot be in the zargled state, and it can only be in one of the two states (zargled or blimmed), the only remaining possibility is that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The flugel is blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
