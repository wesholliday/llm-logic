We are given two statements:\n   a) Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand.\n   b) The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand.\n\n2. From statement (b), we can infer that the notebook is not on the nightstand.\n\n3. Going back to statement (a), we have two possibilities: the notebook is either in the drawer or on the nightstand.\n\n4. Since we know the notebook is not on the nightstand (from statement (b)), the only remaining possibility is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
