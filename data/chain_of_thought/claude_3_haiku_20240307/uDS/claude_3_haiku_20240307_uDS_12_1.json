Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it is hanging in the closet.\n2. The jacket is not hanging in the closet.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can conclude that there are only two possible locations for the jacket: either draped over the chair or hanging in the closet.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the jacket is not hanging in the closet. This means that the only remaining possibility is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes"
