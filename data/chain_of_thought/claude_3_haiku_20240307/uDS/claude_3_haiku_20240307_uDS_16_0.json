We are given two statements:\n   a) Either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk.\n   b) The pen isn't on my desk.\n\n2. From statement (b), we can infer that the pen is not on the desk.\n\n3. Going back to statement (a), we have two possibilities: the pen is either in the bag or on the desk.\n\n4. Since we know the pen is not on the desk (from statement (b)), the only remaining possibility is that the pen is in the bag.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the pen is in your bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
