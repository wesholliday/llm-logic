We are given two statements:\n   a) Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it is blending in on the floor.\n   b) The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor.\n\n2. From statement (b), we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor.\n\n3. Going back to statement (a), we have two possibilities: the missing puzzle piece is either in the box or blending in on the floor.\n\n4. Since we know from statement (b) that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, the only remaining possibility is that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
