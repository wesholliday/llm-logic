This means that the phone is in one of these two locations.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen. This means that the phone cannot be in the kitchen, since it would be ringing if it were there.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can logically infer that the phone must be in the living room. If it is not in the kitchen, and the phone is either in the living room or the kitchen, then it must be in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes"
