We are given two statements:\n   a) Either the shoes are in the closet or they are lined up by the door.\n   b) The shoes aren't lined up by the door.\n\n2. From statement (b), we can infer that the shoes are not lined up by the door.\n\n3. Going back to statement (a), we can see that there are two possibilities: the shoes are either in the closet or lined up by the door.\n\n4. Since we know from statement (b) that the shoes are not lined up by the door, the only remaining possibility is that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes"
