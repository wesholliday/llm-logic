We are given two statements:\n   a) Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table.\n   b) The book isn't resting on the table.\n\n2. From statement (b), we can infer that the book is not resting on the table.\n\n3. Going back to statement (a), we can see that there are two possibilities for the location of the book: either it is on the shelf or it is resting on the table.\n\n4. Since we have already determined that the book is not resting on the table, the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes"
