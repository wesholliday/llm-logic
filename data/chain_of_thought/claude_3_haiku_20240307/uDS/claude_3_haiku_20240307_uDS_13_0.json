We are given two statements:\n   a) Either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf.\n   b) The toy isn't sitting on the shelf.\n\n2. From statement (b), we can infer that the toy is not sitting on the shelf.\n\n3. Going back to statement (a), we can see that there are two possibilities for the location of the toy: either it is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf.\n\n4. Since we have already determined that the toy is not sitting on the shelf, the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
