We are given two statements:\n   a) Either the phone is in the living room or it is ringing in the kitchen.\n   b) The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen.\n\n2. From statement (b), we can infer that the phone is not in the kitchen, since it's not ringing there.\n\n3. Going back to statement (a), we know that the phone is either in the living room or ringing in the kitchen. Since we've established that it's not ringing in the kitchen, the only remaining possibility is that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes"
