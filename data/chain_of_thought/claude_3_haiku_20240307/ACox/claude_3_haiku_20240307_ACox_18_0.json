The first statement is 'The sprocket was daggled'.\n2. The second statement is 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n4. However, the first statement only tells us that the sprocket was daggled, but it does not provide any information about whether the sprocket was cranked or not.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer from the given information that 'The sprocket was cranked'.\n\nAnswer: no"
