The statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" is a conditional statement. It means that if the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled. This does not necessarily mean that if the sprocket was daggled, then it was cranked.\n2. We are given that \"The sprocket was daggled.\" This means that the condition in the conditional statement is satisfied, but it does not necessarily mean that the sprocket was cranked.\n3.

The second statement is 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled'.\n3. We need to determine if we can infer 'The sprocket was cranked' from these two statements.\n\nTo do this, we can use the logical principle of modus ponens. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (if P, then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then we can infer the consequent (Q).\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled'. The first statement, 'The sprocket was daggled', is the consequent (Q) of this conditional.\n\nHowever, we cannot simply reverse the conditional to infer the antecedent (P), which would be 'The sprocket was cranked'. This would be a logical fallacy known as the 'affirming the consequent'.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The sprocket was cranked'.\n\nAnswer: no"
