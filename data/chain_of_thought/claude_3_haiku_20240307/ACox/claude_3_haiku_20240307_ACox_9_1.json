It says that if the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot infer that 'The twonk was plinked'. The first statement only tells us that the twonk was varnished, but does not provide any information about whether it was plinked or not. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished, but it does not necessarily mean that the twonk was plinked.\n\nIn other words, the given information is not sufficient to conclude that 'The twonk was plinked'.\n\nAnswer: no"
