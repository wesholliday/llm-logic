This is a simple categorical statement, stating that the splat quanked.\n\nThe second statement is 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the splat was morphed, then it follows that the splat quanked.\n\nNow, the question is whether we can infer from these two statements that 'The splat was morphed'.\n\nTo do this, we need to use the logical principle of modus ponens. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B' and we also have the statement 'A', then we can infer 'B'.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked', and we also have the statement 'The splat quanked'.\n\nTherefore, using modus ponens, we can infer that 'The splat was morphed'.\n\nAnswer: yes"

Specifically, we can use the rule of modus ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (if A, then B) and the antecedent (A) is true, then we can conclude that the consequent (B) is also true.\n\nIn this case, we have the conditional statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\", and we know that \"The splat quanked\" is true (from the first statement).
