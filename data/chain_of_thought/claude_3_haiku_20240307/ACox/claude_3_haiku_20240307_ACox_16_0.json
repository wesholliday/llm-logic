'The grommet was plopped' is a given statement.\n2. 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet was plopped' is also a given statement.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet was plopped. This does not necessarily mean that if the grommet was plopped, then the grommet was sploffed.\n\nIn other words, the second statement only tells us that the grommet being sploffed is a sufficient condition for the grommet being plopped, but it does not tell us that the grommet being plopped is a necessary condition for the grommet being sploffed.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot infer that 'The grommet was sploffed'.\n\nAnswer: no"
