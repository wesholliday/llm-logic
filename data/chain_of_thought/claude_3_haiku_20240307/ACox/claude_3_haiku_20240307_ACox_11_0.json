We are given the statement 'The flug was zimmed'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed'.\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that if the flug was blummed, then it was also zimmed.\n4. However, the first statement only tells us that the flug was zimmed, but does not specify whether it was blummed or not.\n5. Therefore, from the given information, we cannot infer that 'The flug was blummed'.\n\nAnswer: no"
