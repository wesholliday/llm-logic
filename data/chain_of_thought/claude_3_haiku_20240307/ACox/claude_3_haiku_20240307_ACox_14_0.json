We are given the statement 'The fribble was crinked'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble was crinked'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble was crinked.\n4. However, the first statement tells us that the fribble was crinked, but it does not tell us whether the fribble was snurgled or not.\n5. From the information provided, we cannot infer that 'The fribble was snurgled'. The fact that the fribble was crinked does not necessarily mean that it was also snurgled.\n\nAnswer: no"
