This tells us that the splat did something, specifically it 'quanked'.\n\n2. The second premise is 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the splat was morphed, then it would have quanked.\n\n3. Since we know from the first premise that 'The splat quanked', we can use the second premise to infer that the splat must have been morphed. This is because the second premise tells us that if the splat was morphed, then it would have quanked, and we know that it did in fact quank.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that 'The splat was morphed'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
