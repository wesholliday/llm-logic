It says that if the wug was flooped, then the wug was bimmed.\n4. To infer that \"The wug was flooped\" from this, we would need to use the rule of modus ponens. This rule states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we also have P, then we can conclude Q.\n5. However, in this case, we do not have the premise \"The wug was flooped\".
