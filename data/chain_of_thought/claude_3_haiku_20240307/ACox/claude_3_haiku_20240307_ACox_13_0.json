We are given the statement 'The splat was quanked'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat was quanked'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the splat was morphed) is true, then the consequent (the splat was quanked) is also true.\n4. Since we know that the consequent 'the splat was quanked' is true, we can use the conditional statement to infer that the antecedent 'the splat was morphed' is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
