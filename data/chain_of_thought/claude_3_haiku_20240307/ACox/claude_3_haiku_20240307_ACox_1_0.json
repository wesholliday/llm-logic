We are given the statement 'The flugel was zargled'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\n4. However, the first statement only tells us that the flugel was zargled, but does not provide any information about whether the flugel was blimmed or not.\n5. Therefore, from the given information, we cannot infer that 'The flugel was blimmed'. The information provided is not sufficient to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
