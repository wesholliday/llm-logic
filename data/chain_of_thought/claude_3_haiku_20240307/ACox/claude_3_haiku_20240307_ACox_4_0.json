We are given the statement 'The fribble crinked'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition 'the fribble was snurgled' is true, then the consequence 'the fribble crinked' is also true.\n4. However, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. Just because 'the fribble crinked' is true, it does not necessarily mean that 'the fribble was snurgled' is also true.\n5. Therefore, from the given information, we cannot infer that 'The fribble was snurgled'.\n\nAnswer: no"
