We are given the statement 'The zinger was smoogled'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was also smoogled.\n4. However, the first statement only tells us that the zinger was smoogled, but it does not tell us whether the zinger was fraggled or not.\n5. From the information provided, we cannot infer that 'The zinger was fraggled'. The fact that the zinger was smoogled does not necessarily mean that it was also fraggled.\n\nAnswer: no"
