We are given two premises:\n   - \"The zinger was smoogled\"\n   - \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\"\n\n2. The second premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was also smoogled.\n\n3. From the first premise, we know that the zinger was smoogled.\n\n4. The question is asking whether we can infer from these two premises that \"The zinger was fraggled\".\n\n5. However, the information given does not allow us to conclusively infer that the zinger was fraggled. The second premise only tells us that if the zinger was fraggled, then it was smoogled.
