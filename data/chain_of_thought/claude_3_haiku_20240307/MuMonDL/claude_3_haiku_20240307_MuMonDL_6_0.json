            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The concert must have been sold out\" implies that all the tickets for the concert were purchased and no more tickets were available. This could be due to the concert being completely sold out, or it could also be the case that the concert had a limited number of tickets available and they were all purchased.\n\nTherefore, the inference \"The concert must have been sold out or had limited tickets\" is valid, as the original statement does not rule out the possibility that the concert had limited tickets.\n\nAnswer: yes"
