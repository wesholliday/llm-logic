The statement only indicates that the room was cleaned daily, without providing any information about whether it was cleaned as requested or on a different schedule.\n\nTo infer that the room was cleaned daily or as requested, we would need additional information that suggests the room was cleaned according to a specific request or schedule, not just daily. The original statement does not provide any such information.\n\nAnswer: no"
