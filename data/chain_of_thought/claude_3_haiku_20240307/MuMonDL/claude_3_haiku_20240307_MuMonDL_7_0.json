While difficulty and challenge are often related, they are not exactly the same. An exam can be difficult but not necessarily challenging, or vice versa.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from the original statement that the exam must have been \"difficult or challenging.\" The original statement only provides information about the difficulty of the exam, not its level of challenge.\n\nAnswer: no"
