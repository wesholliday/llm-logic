It does not make any claims about the keys being on the table or any other location.\n\nTo infer \"The keys must be in the drawer or on the table\" from the original statement, we would need to add additional information that the keys could be on the table as well. The original statement does not provide any information about the keys being on the table, so we cannot logically infer that the keys must be in the drawer or on the table.\n\nAnswer: no"
