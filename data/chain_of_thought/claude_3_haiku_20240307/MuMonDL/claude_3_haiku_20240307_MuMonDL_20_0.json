            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The event must have been formal\" does not necessarily imply that the event must have been formal or black-tie. The term \"formal\" can have different meanings in different contexts, and it does not automatically include the specific requirement of a black-tie dress code.\n\nThe statement \"The event must have been formal\" only indicates that the event had a certain level of formality, such as requiring guests to wear more formal attire, but it does not specify the exact dress code or level of formality. The event could have been formal without necessarily requiring a black-tie dress code.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from the given statement that \"The event must have been formal or black-tie.\" The original statement is not specific enough to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
