The statement only indicates that the flight was delayed, but it does not provide any information about whether the flight was rescheduled or not. The two possibilities are not mutually exclusive, as a delayed flight could have been rescheduled, but the original statement does not explicitly state that the flight was rescheduled.\n\nAnswer: no"
