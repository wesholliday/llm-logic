The statement is a definitive claim that the package was delivered today, and it does not leave room for the possibility of the package being delivered tomorrow.\n\nTo infer that the package could have been delivered today or tomorrow, the original statement would need to be more open-ended, such as \"The package must have been delivered today or sometime recently.\" This would allow for the possibility that the package could have been delivered either today or on a previous day.\n\nAnswer: no"
