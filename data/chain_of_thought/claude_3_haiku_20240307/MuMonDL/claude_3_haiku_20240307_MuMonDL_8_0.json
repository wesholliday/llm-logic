It only states that the restaurant was closed on Mondays, without providing any additional information about the restaurant's operating hours on that day.\n\nTo infer that the restaurant \"had limited hours\" on Mondays, we would need additional information or context that suggests the restaurant was not completely closed, but rather had reduced or limited operating hours on that day.\n\nThe given statement, \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays,\" does not provide enough information to make that inference. It only tells us that the restaurant was closed on Mondays, without specifying whether it was completely closed or had limited hours.\n\nAnswer: no"
