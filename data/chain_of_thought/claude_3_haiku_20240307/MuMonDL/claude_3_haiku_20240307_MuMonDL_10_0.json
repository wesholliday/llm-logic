The statement only indicates that the document was signed, but it does not provide any information about whether the document was also approved.\n\nThe act of signing a document and the act of approving a document are two distinct actions. A document can be signed without being approved, or it can be approved without being signed. Therefore, the original statement \"The document must have been signed\" does not allow us to infer that the document must have been signed or approved.\n\nAnswer: no"
