The statement only specifies that the application was completed online, but it does not provide any information about the method of submission. The application could have been completed online and then printed and submitted physically, or it could have been completed and submitted electronically. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The application must have been completed online or submitted electronically\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
