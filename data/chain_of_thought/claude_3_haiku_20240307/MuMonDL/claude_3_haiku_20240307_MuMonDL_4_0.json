It only suggests that the meeting was originally scheduled for 2 PM, but it does not provide any information about whether the meeting was actually held at that time or if it was rescheduled.\n\nTo infer that the meeting \"must have been scheduled for 2 PM or been rescheduled,\" we would need additional information that the meeting did not take place at 2 PM as originally scheduled. Without that information, the only thing we can infer from the given statement is that the meeting was scheduled for 2 PM, but we cannot conclude that it was rescheduled.\n\nAnswer: no"
