The first premise is 'Either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped'. This means that the grommet is either sploffed or plopped, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is 'It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped'. This means that the grommet is not plopped.\n\n3. Since the grommet is either sploffed or plopped, and it's not plopped, then the grommet must be sploffed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The grommet is sploffed'.\n\nAnswer: yes"

It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can say that if the grommet is not sploffed, then it must be plopped. This is because the statement uses the logical \"or\" connector, which means that one of the two conditions must be true.\n\nThe second statement tells us that it's not the case that the grommet must be plopped. This means that the grommet cannot be plopped.\n\nNow, if the grommet cannot be plopped, and the first statement tells us that it must either be sploffed or plopped, then the only remaining option is that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
