The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the sneg is not crampled, then it must be sproted.\n4. The second statement tells us that the sneg is not sproted.\n5. Therefore, if the sneg is not sproted, and it must either be crampled or sproted, then the sneg must be crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
