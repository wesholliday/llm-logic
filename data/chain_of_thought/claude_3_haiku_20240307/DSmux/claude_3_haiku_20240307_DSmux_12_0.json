We are also given the statement: \"It's not the case that the smip must be lupped.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the smip is not shripped, then it must be lupped.\n4. However, the second statement tells us that it's not the case that the smip must be lupped.\n5. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes"
