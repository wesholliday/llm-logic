The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the smonk is not vreebled, then it must be plagged.\n4. The second statement tells us that the smonk is not plagged.\n5. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
