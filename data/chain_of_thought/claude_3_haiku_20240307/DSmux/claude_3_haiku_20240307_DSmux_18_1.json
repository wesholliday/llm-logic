The first premise states: \"Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged.\" This means that the shank is either plooked or it must be nugged.\n\n2. The second premise states: \"It's not the case that the shank must be nugged.\" This means that the shank is not required to be nugged.\n\n3. If the shank is not required to be nugged, and the only two possibilities are that it is either plooked or must be nugged, then the shank must be plooked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that \"The shank is plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
