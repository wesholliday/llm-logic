The first premise is \"Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged.\" This means that the shank must be either plooked or nugged, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is \"It's not the case that the shank must be nugged.\" This means that the shank cannot be nugged.\n\n3. If the shank cannot be nugged, and it must be either plooked or nugged, then the only remaining option is that the shank must be plooked.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that \"The shank is plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
