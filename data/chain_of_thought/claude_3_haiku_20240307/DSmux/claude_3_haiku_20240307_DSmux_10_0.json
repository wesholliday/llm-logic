The second premise is: \"It's not the case that the wug must be garpled.\"\n3. From the first premise, we know that there are two possibilities: either the wug is sproinged, or it must be garpled.\n4. The second premise tells us that the wug must not be garpled.\n5. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
