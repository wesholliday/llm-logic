The second premise is: \"It's not the case that the dreb must be spened.\"\n3. From the first premise, we can infer that if the dreb is not vroombed, then it must be spened.\n4. However, the second premise tells us that it's not the case that the dreb must be spened.\n5. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
