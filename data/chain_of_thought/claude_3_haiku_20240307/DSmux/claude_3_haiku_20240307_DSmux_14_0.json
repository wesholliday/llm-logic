The second premise is \"It's not the case that the clug must be snugged.\"\n3. From the first premise, we know that either the clug is fleeked or it must be snugged. This means that if the clug is not fleeked, then it must be snugged.\n4. The second premise tells us that it's not the case that the clug must be snugged. This means that the clug cannot be snugged.\n5. Therefore, if the clug cannot be snugged, and it must either be fleeked or snugged, then the clug must be fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
