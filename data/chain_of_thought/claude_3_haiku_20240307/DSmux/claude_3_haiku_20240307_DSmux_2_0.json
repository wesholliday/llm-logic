The first premise is \"Either the wug is flooped or it must be bimmed.\" This means that the wug is either flooped or bimmed, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is \"It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed.\" This means that the wug is not bimmed.\n\n3. Since the wug is not bimmed, and it must either be flooped or bimmed, the only remaining possibility is that the wug is flooped.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that \"The wug is flooped.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
