The first premise is \"Either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked.\" This means that the whiffle must be either shanked or tinked, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is \"It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked.\" This means that the whiffle cannot be tinked.\n\n3. If the whiffle cannot be tinked, and it must be either shanked or tinked, then the only remaining possibility is that the whiffle must be shanked.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that \"The whiffle is shanked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
