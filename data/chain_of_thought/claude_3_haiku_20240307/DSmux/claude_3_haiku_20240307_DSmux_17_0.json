The second premise is \"It's not the case that the flob must be movated.\"\n3. From the first premise, we can infer that if the flob is not skizzled, then it must be movated.\n4. The second premise tells us that the flob is not movated.\n5. Therefore, by combining the two premises, we can infer that the flob must be skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
