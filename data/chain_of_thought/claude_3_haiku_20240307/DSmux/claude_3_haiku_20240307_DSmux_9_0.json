The second premise is \"It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked.\"\n3. From the first premise, we can infer that if the twonk is not varnished, then it must be plinked.\n4. However, the second premise tells us that it's not the case that the twonk must be plinked.\n5. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes"
