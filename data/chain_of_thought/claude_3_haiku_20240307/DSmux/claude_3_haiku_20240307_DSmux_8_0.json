The first premise is \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled.\" This means that the sprocket is either cranked or daggled, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is \"It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled.\" This means that the sprocket is not daggled.\n\n3. Since the sprocket is either cranked or daggled, and it's not the case that it must be daggled, then the only remaining possibility is that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that \"The sprocket is cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
