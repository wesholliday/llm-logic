We are also given the premise: \"It's not the case that the dreb must be spened\".\n3. From the first premise, we know that there are two possibilities: either the dreb is vroombed, or the dreb must be spened.\n4. The second premise tells us that the dreb must not be spened.\n5. Since the dreb cannot be spened, and the first premise gives us two possibilities, the only remaining possibility is that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The dreb is vroombed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
