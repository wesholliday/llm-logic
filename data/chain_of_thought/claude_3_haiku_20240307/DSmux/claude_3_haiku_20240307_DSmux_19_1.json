The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged.\"\n3. The question is asking whether we can infer from these two statements that \"The smonk is vreebled.\"\n4. Let's consider the first statement. If the smonk is not vreebled, then it must be plagged. This is because the statement says \"Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged,\" which means that these are the only two possibilities.\n5. Now, the second statement tells us that it's not the case that the smonk must be plagged. This means that the smonk cannot be plagged, because if it were plagged, it would have to be the case that it must be plagged (according to the first statement).\n6.
