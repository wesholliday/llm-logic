The first premise is 'Either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled'. This means that the zinger is either fraggled or smoogled, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is 'It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled'. This means that the zinger is not smoogled.\n\n3. Since the zinger is either fraggled or smoogled, and it is not smoogled, then the only remaining possibility is that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer 'The zinger is fraggled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
