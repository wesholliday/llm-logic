The first premise is \"Either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged.\" This means that the glip must either be slogged or tragged, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is \"It's not the case that the glip must be tragged.\" This means that the glip cannot be tragged.\n\n3. If the glip cannot be tragged, and it must either be slogged or tragged, then the only remaining option is that the glip must be slogged.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that \"The glip is slogged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
