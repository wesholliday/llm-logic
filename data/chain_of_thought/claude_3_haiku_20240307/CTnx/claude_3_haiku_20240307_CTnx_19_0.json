This means that if the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk did not plagg.\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\", we need to consider the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive is also a conditional statement in the form \"If not B, then not A\".\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be: \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\".\n\nTherefore, we can infer the statement \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\" from the given statement \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk did not plagg\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
