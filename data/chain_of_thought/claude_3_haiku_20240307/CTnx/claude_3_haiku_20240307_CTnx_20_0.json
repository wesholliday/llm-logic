The contrapositive is also a valid logical inference and has the form 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nApplying this to the given statement, the contrapositive would be 'If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered' from the given statement 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it did not surn'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
