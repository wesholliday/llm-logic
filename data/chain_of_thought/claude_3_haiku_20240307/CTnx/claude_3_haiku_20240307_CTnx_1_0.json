The contrapositive is a logically equivalent statement that has the form 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be 'If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed' from the given statement 'If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
