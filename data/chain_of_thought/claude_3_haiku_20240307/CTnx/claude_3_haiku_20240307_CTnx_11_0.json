The contrapositive is also a conditional statement in the form \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be: \"If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was not blummed\".\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was not blummed' from the given statement 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was not zimmed'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
