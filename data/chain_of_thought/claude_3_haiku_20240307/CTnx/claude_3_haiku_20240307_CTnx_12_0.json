This means that if the condition A (the smip was shripped) is true, then the conclusion B (the smip did not lup the zoint) must be true.\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was not shripped\", we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is also a conditional statement, but with the antecedent and consequent reversed: \"If not B, then not A\".\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be: \"If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was not shripped\".\n\nTherefore, we can infer the desired statement from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
