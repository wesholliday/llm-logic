The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement and has the form \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\nApplying this to the given statement, the contrapositive would be: \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled\".\n\nThis contrapositive statement is logically equivalent to the statement \"If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled\".\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled' from the given statement 'If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
