This can be symbolized as \"A \u2192 \u00acB\", where A represents \"the splat was morphed\" and B represents \"the splat quank\".\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed\", we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement and has the form \"If not B, then not A\". This can be symbolized as \"\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA\".\n\nApplying this to the given statement, we can infer that \"If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
