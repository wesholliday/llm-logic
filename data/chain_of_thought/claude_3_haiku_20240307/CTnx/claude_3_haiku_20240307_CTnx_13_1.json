It states that if the glip was slogged, then the glip was not tragged.\n\nTo infer the statement 'If the glip was tragged, then the glip was not slogged', we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is a logically equivalent statement that has the following form:\n'If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged'.\n\nThis means that if the glip was tragged, then the glip was not slogged, which is exactly the statement we are trying to infer.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the glip was tragged, then the glip was not slogged' from the given statement 'If the glip was slogged, then the glip was not tragged'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
