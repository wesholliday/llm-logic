This means that if the grommet was sploffed (A), then the grommet did not plop the frink (not B).\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed\", we need to negate both the antecedent and the consequent of the original statement. This would result in the statement \"If the grommet plopped the frink (not A), then the grommet was not sploffed (B)\".\n\nHowever, this inference is not valid. The negation of the original statement does not necessarily lead to the desired conclusion. The original statement only tells us that if the grommet was sploffed, then it did not plop the frink, but it does not provide any information about the converse relationship.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed' from the given statement 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink'.\n\nAnswer: no"
