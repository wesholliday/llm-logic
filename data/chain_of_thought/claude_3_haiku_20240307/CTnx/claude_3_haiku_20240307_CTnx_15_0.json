This means that if the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was not spened.\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\", we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is also a conditional statement in the form \"If not B, then not A\".\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\".\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed' from the given statement 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was not spened'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
