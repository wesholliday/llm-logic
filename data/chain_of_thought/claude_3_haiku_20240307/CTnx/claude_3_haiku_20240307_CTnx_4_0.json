This means that if the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink.\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\", we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is also a valid logical inference and has the form \"If not B, then not A\".\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be: \"If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\".\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled' from the given statement 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
