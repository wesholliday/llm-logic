The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement and has the form 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nApplying this to the given statement, the contrapositive would be 'If the wug was garpled, then the wug was not sproinged'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the wug was garpled, then the wug was not sproinged' from the given statement 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was not garpled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
