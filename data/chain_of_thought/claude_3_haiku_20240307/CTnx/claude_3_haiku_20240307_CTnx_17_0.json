This means that if the flob was skizzled, then the flob did not movate.\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the flob movated, then the flob was not skizzled\", we need to consider the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive is also a conditional statement in the form \"If not B, then not A\".\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the flob movated, then the flob was not skizzled\".\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the flob movated, then the flob was not skizzled' from the given statement 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob did not movated'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
