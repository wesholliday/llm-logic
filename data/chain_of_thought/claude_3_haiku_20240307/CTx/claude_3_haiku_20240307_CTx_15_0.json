The contrapositive is also a valid logical inference and has the form 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be 'If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed' from the given statement 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
