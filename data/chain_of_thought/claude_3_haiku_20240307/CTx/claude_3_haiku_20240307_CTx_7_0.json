The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be 'If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked' from the given statement 'If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
