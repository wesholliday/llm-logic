The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be 'If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked' from the given statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
