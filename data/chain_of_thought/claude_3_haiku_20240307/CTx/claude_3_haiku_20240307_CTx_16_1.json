This means that if the antecedent (A) is true, then the consequent (B) must also be true.\n5) The inference we are asked about is also a conditional statement in the form \"If not B, then not A\".\n6) This type of inference is called the contrapositive of the original statement, and it is a valid logical inference.\n7) Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
