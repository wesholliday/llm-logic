The contrapositive of 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be 'If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed' from the given statement 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
