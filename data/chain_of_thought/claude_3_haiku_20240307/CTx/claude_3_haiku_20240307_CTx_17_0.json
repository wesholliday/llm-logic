The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement and has the form 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be 'If the flob did not movate, then the flob was not skizzled'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the flob did not movated, then the flob was not skizzled' from the given statement 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
