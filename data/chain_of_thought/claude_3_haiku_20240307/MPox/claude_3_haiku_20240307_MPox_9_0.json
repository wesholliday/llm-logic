The first premise is 'The twonk was plinked'.\n2. The second premise is 'If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished'.\n3. The second premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the twonk was plinked) is true, then the consequent (it was varnished) must also be true.\n4. Since the first premise states that 'The twonk was plinked' is true, we can apply the conditional statement and conclude that 'It was varnished' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
