We are given the premise 'The clug was fleeked'.\n2. We are also given the premise 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged'.\n3. The second premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the clug was fleeked) is true, then the consequent (the clug snugged) must also be true.\n4. Since the first premise states that 'The clug was fleeked' is true, we can apply the conditional statement and conclude that 'The clug snugged' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
