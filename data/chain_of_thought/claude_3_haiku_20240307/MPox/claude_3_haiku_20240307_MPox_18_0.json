We are given the statement 'The shank was plooked'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the shank was plooked) is true, then the consequent (the shank was nugged) must also be true.\n4. Since we know that 'The shank was plooked' is true, we can apply the conditional statement and infer that 'The shank was nugged' is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
