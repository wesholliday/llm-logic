The first premise is 'The smip was shripped'.\n2. The second premise is 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint'.\n3. The rules of logic state that if we have a conditional statement (the second premise) and the antecedent is true (the first premise), then we can infer the consequent.\n4.
