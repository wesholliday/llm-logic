We are also given the statement \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\".\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the premise \"the glip was slogged\" is true, then the conclusion \"the glip was tragged\" must also be true.\n4. Since we are told that \"The glip was slogged\" is true, we can infer that the premise of the conditional statement is true.\n5. Therefore, by the rules of logic, we can conclude that the conclusion \"the glip was tragged\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"

Since the first statement, 'The glip was slogged', is true, we can apply the conditional statement.
