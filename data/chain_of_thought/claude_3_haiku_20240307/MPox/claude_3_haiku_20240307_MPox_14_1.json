This is the premise.\n\nThe second statement is 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the clug was fleeked) is true, then the second part (the clug snugged) must also be true.\n\nThe question is asking if we can infer 'The clug snugged' from these two statements.\n\nTo answer this, we can use the process of modus ponens, which is a rule of logical inference. If we have a conditional statement (if A, then B) and the antecedent (A) is true, then we can infer the consequent (B).\n\nIn this case, the first statement 'The clug was fleeked' is the antecedent (A), and the second statement 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged' is the conditional statement (if A, then B).
