The second premise is 'If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled'.\n\nThe second premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the flugel was blimmed) is true, then the consequent (the flugel was zargled) must also be true.\n\nSince the first premise states that 'The flugel was blimmed', and the second premise tells us that if the flugel was blimmed, then it was zargled, we can infer that 'The flugel was zargled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
