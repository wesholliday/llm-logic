The second premise is 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked'.\n\nUsing the second premise, we can apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (if A, then B) and the antecedent (A) is true, then we can infer the consequent (B).\n\nIn this case, the antecedent 'the fribble was snurgled' is true, based on the first premise. Therefore, we can infer the consequent 'the fribble crinked'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
