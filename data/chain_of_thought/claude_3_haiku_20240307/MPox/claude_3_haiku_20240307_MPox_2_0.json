We are given the statement 'The wug was flooped'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the wug was flooped) is true, then the consequent (the wug bimmed the zoint) is also true.\n4. Since we know that the antecedent 'The wug was flooped' is true, we can infer that the consequent 'The wug bimmed the zoint' is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
