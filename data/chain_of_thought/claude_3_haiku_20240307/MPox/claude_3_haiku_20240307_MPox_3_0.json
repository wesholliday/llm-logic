The first premise is 'The splat was morphed'.\n2. The second premise is 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked'.\n3. The second premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the splat was morphed) is true, then the second part (the splat quanked) must also be true.\n4. Since the first premise states that 'The splat was morphed' is true, we can apply the conditional statement from the second premise.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that 'The splat quanked' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
