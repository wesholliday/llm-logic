This tells us that the wug was subjected to the action of 'sproinging'.\n\n2. The second premise is 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled'. This is a conditional statement that establishes a logical connection between the wug being sproinged and the wug being garpled.\n\n3. From the first premise, we know that the wug was sproinged. \n\n4. Since the second premise is a conditional statement, and the antecedent (the wug was sproinged) is true, we can infer the consequent (the wug was garpled) is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer 'It was garpled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
