We are given the statement 'The flug was blummed'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the flug was blummed) is true, then the consequent (the flug was zimmed) must also be true.\n4. Since we are told that 'The flug was blummed' is true, we can apply the conditional statement and conclude that 'The flug was zimmed' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
