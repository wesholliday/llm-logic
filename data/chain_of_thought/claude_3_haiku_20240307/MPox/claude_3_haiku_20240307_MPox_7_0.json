The first premise is 'The whiffle was shanked'.\n2. The second premise is 'If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked'.\n3. The second premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the whiffle was shanked) is true, then the consequent (the whiffle tinked) must also be true.\n4. Since the first premise states that 'The whiffle was shanked' is true, we can apply the conditional statement and conclude that 'The whiffle tinked' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
