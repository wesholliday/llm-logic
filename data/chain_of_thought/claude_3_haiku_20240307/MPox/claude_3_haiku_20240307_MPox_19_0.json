The first premise is 'The smonk was vreebled'.\n2. The second premise is 'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged'.\n3. The question is asking whether we can infer 'The smonk plagged' from these two premises.\n4. The second premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the smonk was vreebled) is true, then the consequent (the smonk plagged) must also be true.\n5. Since the first premise states that 'The smonk was vreebled' is true, we can apply the conditional statement and conclude that 'The smonk plagged' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
