The first premise is 'The sprocket was cranked'.\n2. The second premise is 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled'.\n3. The second premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the sprocket was cranked) is true, then the consequent (the sprocket was daggled) must also be true.\n4. Since the first premise states that 'The sprocket was cranked' is true, we can apply the conditional statement and conclude that 'The sprocket was daggled' is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
