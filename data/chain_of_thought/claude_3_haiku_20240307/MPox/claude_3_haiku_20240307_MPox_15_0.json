We are given the statement 'The dreb was vroombed'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the dreb was vroombed) is true, then the consequent (the dreb was spened) must also be true.\n4. Since we are told that 'The dreb was vroombed' is true, we can apply the conditional statement and conclude that 'The dreb was spened' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
