This is the antecedent.\n\nThe second statement is 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink'. This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is 'the sneg was crampled' and the consequent is 'the sneg sproted the frink'.\n\nTo infer 'The sneg sproted the frink' from these two statements, we need to use the rule of modus ponens. This rule states that if we have a conditional statement (if P, then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then we can infer the consequent (Q).\n\nIn this case, we have the conditional statement 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink', and the antecedent 'The sneg was crampled' is true.
