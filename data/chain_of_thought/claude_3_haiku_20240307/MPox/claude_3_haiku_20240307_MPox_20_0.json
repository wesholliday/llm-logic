We are given the statement 'The fleeg was bluttered'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the fleeg was bluttered) is true, then the consequent (it surned) is also true.\n4. Since we know that the antecedent 'The fleeg was bluttered' is true, we can infer that the consequent 'it surned' is also true.\n5. Therefore, we can infer 'The fleeg surned' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
