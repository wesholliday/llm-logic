The first premise is 'The flob was skizzled'.\n2. The second premise is 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated'.\n3. The conclusion we want to determine is 'The flob movated'.\n4. The second premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the flob was skizzled) is true, then the consequent (the flob movated) must also be true.\n5. Since the first premise states that 'The flob was skizzled' is true, we can apply the conditional statement from the second premise.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that 'The flob movated' is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
