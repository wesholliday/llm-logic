We are given the statement 'The glip was slogged'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the glip was slogged) is true, then the consequent (the glip was tragged) must also be true.\n4. Since we are told that 'The glip was slogged' is true, we can apply the conditional statement and infer that 'The glip was tragged' is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
