The first premise is 'The zinger was fraggled'.\n2. The second premise is 'If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled'.\n3. The second premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the zinger was fraggled, then it follows that the zinger was smoogled.\n4. Since the first premise states that 'The zinger was fraggled', we can apply the conditional statement from the second premise.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that 'The zinger was smoogled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
