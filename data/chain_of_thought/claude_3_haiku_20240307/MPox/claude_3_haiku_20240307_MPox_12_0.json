We are given the statement 'The smip was shripped'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the smip was shripped) is true, then the consequent (the smip lupped the zoint) must also be true.\n4. Since we know that the antecedent 'The smip was shripped' is true, we can infer that the consequent 'The smip lupped the zoint' is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
