We are given the statement 'The sneg was crampled'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the sneg was crampled) is true, then the consequent (the sneg sproted the frink) is also true.\n4. Since we know that the antecedent 'The sneg was crampled' is true, we can infer that the consequent 'The sneg sproted the frink' is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
