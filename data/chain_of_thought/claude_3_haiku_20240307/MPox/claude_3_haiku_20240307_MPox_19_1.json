The rule of inference we can apply here is modus ponens, which states that if we have the premise 'If P, then Q' and the premise 'P', then we can infer 'Q'.\n4. In this case, the first premise 'The smonk was vreebled' corresponds to 'P', and the second premise 'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged' corresponds to 'If P, then Q'.\n5. Applying the modus ponens rule, we can therefore infer 'The smonk plagged', which corresponds to 'Q'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
