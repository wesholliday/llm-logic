We are given the statement 'The grommet was sploffed'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the grommet was sploffed) is true, then the consequent (the grommet plopped the frink) must also be true.\n4. Since we know that the antecedent 'The grommet was sploffed' is true, we can infer that the consequent 'The grommet plopped the frink' is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
