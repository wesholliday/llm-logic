The statement only tells us that the book had a red cover, but it does not provide any information about the book's location. \n\nTo infer that the book was on the shelf and had a red cover, we would need additional information that directly connects the book's location to its red cover. The given statement alone does not provide that connection.\n\nAnswer: no"
