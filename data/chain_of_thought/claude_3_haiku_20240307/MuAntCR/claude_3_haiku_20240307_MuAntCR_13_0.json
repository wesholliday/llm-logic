However, this does not necessarily mean that the movie was in English. It is possible that the movie was in a different language, such as French or Spanish, and still had subtitles.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the movie 'must have been in English and had subtitles' from the given statement. The statement only implies that the movie had subtitles, but does not specify the original language of the movie.\n\nAnswer: no"
