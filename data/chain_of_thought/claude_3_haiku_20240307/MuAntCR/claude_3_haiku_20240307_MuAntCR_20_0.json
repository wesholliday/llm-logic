The requirement of tickets could be for various reasons, such as crowd control, security, or to manage the capacity of the event. The formality of the event is not directly stated in the given information.\n\nTo infer that the event was formal based on the requirement of tickets, we would need additional information about the nature of the event, such as the type of event, the venue, the dress code, or any other details that would suggest it was a formal occasion.\n\nAnswer: no"
