The statement only indicates that the project was under budget, but it does not provide any information about the completion date or timeline of the project.\n\nTo infer that the project was completed by Friday and was under budget, we would need additional information or context that specifically mentions the project's completion date and budget constraints. The given statement alone does not provide enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
