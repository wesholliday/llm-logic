            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The concert must have started at 8 PM\" does not provide enough information to infer that the concert must have been sold out. The fact that the concert started at 8 PM does not necessarily mean that it was sold out. There could be various reasons why the concert started at 8 PM, such as the scheduled start time, regardless of the attendance or ticket sales.\n\nTo infer that the concert was sold out, we would need additional information beyond just the start time. For example, if the statement was \"The concert was sold out and must have started at 8 PM,\" then we could infer that the concert was both sold out and started at the specified time.\n\nAnswer: no"
