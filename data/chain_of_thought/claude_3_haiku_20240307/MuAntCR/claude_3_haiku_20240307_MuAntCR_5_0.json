The statement only indicates that the package was signed for at some point, but it does not specify the exact date of delivery and signing.\n\nThe package could have been delivered and signed for on any day prior to the present time, not necessarily yesterday. Without additional information about the specific date of delivery and signing, we cannot infer that the package was delivered and signed for yesterday.\n\nAnswer: no"
