            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been notarized\" implies that the document has gone through the process of notarization. Notarization typically involves two main steps: 1) the document must be signed by the signer, and 2) the signature must be witnessed and certified by a notary public.\n\nTherefore, if a document has been notarized, it can be inferred that the document must have been signed prior to the notarization process. The notary public would not be able to certify the signature if the document had not been signed in the first place.\n\nAnswer: yes"
