The statement only indicates that the application included references, but it does not provide any information about the method of submission (online or otherwise).\n\nTo infer that the application must have been completed online, we would need additional information that specifically states or implies that the application was submitted online. The given statement alone does not provide enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
