The fact that an exam covers all chapters does not automatically mean it was difficult. It is possible for an exam to cover all chapters while still being of a reasonable difficulty level.\n\nTo infer that the exam was both difficult and covered all chapters, we would need additional information or context that specifically indicates the exam was difficult. The given statement alone does not provide enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
