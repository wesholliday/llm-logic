Since the statement uses the word \"or\", it indicates that the two possibilities are mutually exclusive, meaning that the software will either be updated or reinstalled, but not both.\n\nTherefore, from the given statement, we can infer that the software might be updated, as this is one of the two possible outcomes mentioned in the statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
