This means that the package might be delivered today, or it might be delivered tomorrow, or it might be delivered on both days.\n\nSince the original statement includes the possibility of the package being delivered today, we can infer that 'The package might be delivered today' is a valid conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes"
