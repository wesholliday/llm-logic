This means that the flight either might be delayed or it might be on time, or both.\n\nFrom this statement, we can infer that the flight might be delayed, as this is one of the possibilities presented in the original statement. The statement does not rule out the possibility of the flight being delayed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
