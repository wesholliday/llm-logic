The contract might be valid for a year.\n2. The contract might be renewable, which means it could be extended beyond the initial year.\n\nSince the statement presents these two possibilities using the word \"or\", we can infer that the contract might be valid for a year, as this is one of the possibilities mentioned.\n\nAnswer: yes"
