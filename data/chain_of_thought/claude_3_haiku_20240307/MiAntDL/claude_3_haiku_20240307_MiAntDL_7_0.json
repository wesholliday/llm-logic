This means that the exam could be either difficult or easy, or both.\n\nIf we infer 'The exam might be difficult' from this statement, we are essentially saying that one of the possibilities (the exam being difficult) is true. This is a valid inference, as the original statement allows for the possibility of the exam being difficult.\n\nAnswer: yes"
