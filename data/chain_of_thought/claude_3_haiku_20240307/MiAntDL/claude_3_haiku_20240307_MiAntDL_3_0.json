This statement does not imply that both possibilities are true simultaneously. \n\nFrom this statement, we can infer that the keys might be in the drawer, as this is one of the possibilities mentioned. However, we cannot infer that the keys are definitely in the drawer, as the statement also includes the possibility that the keys might be on the table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
