The statement does not definitively state that the meeting will be at 2 PM, but rather that it \"might\" be at that time.\n\nTo infer that \"The meeting might be at 2 PM\" from the given statement, we need to consider that one of the two possibilities presented is that the meeting might be at 2 PM. Since the statement does not rule out this possibility, we can infer that the meeting might be at 2 PM.\n\nAnswer: yes"
