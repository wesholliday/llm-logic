            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The room might be cleaned daily or upon request\" presents two possible scenarios for the cleaning of the room: it might be cleaned daily or it might be cleaned upon request. \n\nTo infer that \"The room might be cleaned daily\" from this statement, we need to determine if the \"daily\" cleaning is a definite or a possible occurrence. The use of the word \"might\" in the original statement suggests that the daily cleaning is a possible, but not a definite, occurrence.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The room might be cleaned daily\" is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
