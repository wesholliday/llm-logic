The first premise is: \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door.\"\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door.\"\n3. From the second premise, we can infer that the shoes are not lined up by the door.\n4.

The given statements are:\n   - \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door\"\n   - \"It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door\"\n\n2. The first statement is a disjunction, which means that either the shoes are in the closet, or they must be lined up by the door, but not both.\n\n3. The second statement negates the second part of the disjunction, which means that the shoes cannot be lined up by the door.\n\n4.
