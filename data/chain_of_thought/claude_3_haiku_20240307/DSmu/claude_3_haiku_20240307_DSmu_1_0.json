This means that Fido is either inside or must be in the garden, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\". This means that Fido is not required to be in the garden.\n\n3. If Fido is not required to be in the garden, and the only other option is that he is inside, then we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
