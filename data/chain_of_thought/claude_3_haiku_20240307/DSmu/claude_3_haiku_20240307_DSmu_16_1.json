This statement can be represented logically as: (P v Q), where P represents \"the pen is in my bag\" and Q represents \"the pen must be on my desk.\"\n3. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\"\n4. This statement can be represented logically as: ~Q, where the tilde (~) represents negation.\n5. Now, let's apply the logical rules to see if we can infer \"The pen is in my bag\" from these two statements.\n6. From the first statement, we know that either P is true or Q is true (or both).\n7. From the second statement, we know that Q is false (i.e., the pen is not on your desk).\n8. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that P is true, which means \"The pen is in my bag.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
