This means that the sunglasses can be in one of two places: in her bag or perched on her head.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second premise.\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head. This means that the sunglasses cannot be perched on her head, as this would contradict the second premise.\n\nStep 3: Draw the conclusion.\nSince the sunglasses cannot be perched on her head (according to the second premise), and the first premise states that they are either in her bag or perched on her head, the only remaining possibility is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
