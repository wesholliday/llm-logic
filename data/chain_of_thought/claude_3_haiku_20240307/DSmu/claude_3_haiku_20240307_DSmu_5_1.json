This statement is in the form of a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\nThe second premise is: 'It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry'. This statement is the negation of the second part of the disjunction in the first premise. In other words, it means that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry.\n\nGiven these two premises, we can conclude that the cookies must be in the jar. This is because the first premise states that the cookies are either in the jar or hidden in the pantry, and the second premise eliminates the possibility of them being hidden in the pantry.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The cookies are in the jar'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
