The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications of these two statements:\n\nThe first statement presents two possibilities: either the sunglasses are in her bag, or they must be perched on her head. The second statement tells us that the second possibility (the sunglasses must be perched on her head) is not the case.\n\nIf the second possibility is not the case, then the only remaining possibility is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
