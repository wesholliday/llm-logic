This is an inclusive disjunction, meaning that one or the other possibility, or both, could be true.\n\nThe second statement negates the possibility that the missing sock must be under the bed. This means that the missing sock cannot be under the bed.\n\nGiven that the missing sock cannot be under the bed, the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes"
