If the cat is not playing in the bedroom, then the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n2.

This means that either one of the two possibilities is true, but not both.\n\nThe second statement, \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom,\" is a negation of the second part of the disjunction. This means that the cat is not necessarily playing in the bedroom.\n\nNow, let's consider the two possibilities:\n1. If the cat is not playing in the bedroom, then the first part of the disjunction must be true, which means the cat is napping on the couch.\n2. If the cat is not playing in the bedroom, and the cat is not napping on the couch, then the disjunction is false, which is not possible given the first statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes"
