The first statement is \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\" This means that the pen cannot be on the desk, as that would be a necessary condition.\n\n3. If the pen cannot be on the desk, and the first statement gives us two possibilities (in the bag or on the desk), then the only remaining possibility is that the pen must be in the bag.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
