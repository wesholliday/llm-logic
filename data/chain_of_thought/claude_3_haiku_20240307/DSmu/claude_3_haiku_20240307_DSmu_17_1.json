The second premise is \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n3. From the first premise, we can see that there are two possible options for the location of the scarf: either it is stuffed in the backpack or it is draped on the coat rack.\n4. The second premise tells us that the second option, that the scarf is draped on the coat rack, is not the case.\n5.

This statement expresses a logical disjunction, meaning that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\nThe second premise is 'It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack'. This statement denies the possibility that the scarf is draped on the coat rack.\n\nFrom the two premises, we can reason as follows:\n1.
