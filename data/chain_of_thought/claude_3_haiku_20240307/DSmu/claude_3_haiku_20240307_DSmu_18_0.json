The first premise is: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n3. From the first premise, we can infer that the notebook is either in the drawer or on the nightstand.\n4. The second premise tells us that the notebook is not necessarily on the nightstand.\n5.
