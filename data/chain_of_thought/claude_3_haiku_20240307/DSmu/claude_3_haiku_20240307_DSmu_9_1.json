The first statement is: \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor.\"\n   This statement is in the form of an 'either-or' statement, which means that one of the two options must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\"\n   This statement is a negation of the second part of the first statement, which means that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor.\n\n3. Since the second statement negates the second part of the first statement, we can infer that the first part of the first statement must be true.\n   In other words, the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
