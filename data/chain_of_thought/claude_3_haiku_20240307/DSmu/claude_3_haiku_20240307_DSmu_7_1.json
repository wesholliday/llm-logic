This means that the umbrella is either in the car or in the closet, but not both.\n\nThe second premise is 'It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.' This means that the umbrella is not in the closet.\n\nGiven these two premises, we can logically infer that if the umbrella is not in the closet, then it must be in the car. This is because the first premise states that the umbrella is either in the car or in the closet, and the second premise eliminates the possibility of it being in the closet.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The umbrella is in the car.'\n\nAnswer: yes"
