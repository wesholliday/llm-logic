This means that Fido is either inside or must be in the garden.\n\n2) The second premise is 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'. This means that Fido is not necessarily in the garden.\n\n3) Since Fido is either inside or must be in the garden, and he is not necessarily in the garden, the only other possibility is that he is inside.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer 'Fido is inside'.\n\nAnswer: yes"

The second premise is \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n3. From the first premise, we know that either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden. This means that there are two possible scenarios: either Fido is inside, or Fido must be in the garden.\n4. The second premise tells us that it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden. This means that the second scenario (Fido must be in the garden) is false.\n5. Since the second scenario is false, the first scenario must be true, which means that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"

The first statement, \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden,\" is a disjunction, which means that one of the two statements must be true.\n\n2. The second statement, \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" means that the second part of the disjunction in the first statement is not true.\n\n3. If the second part of the disjunction in the first statement is not true, then the first part must be true.

We are also given the statement: \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can conclude that either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden. We can represent this using the logical OR operator: \"Fido is inside OR Fido is in the garden.\"\n4. The second statement tells us that it is not the case that Fido must be in the garden. This means that Fido cannot be in the garden.\n5. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
