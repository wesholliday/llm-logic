The first statement is: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the remote control is not on the coffee table, then it must be hiding under the couch.\n4. However, the second statement contradicts this, as it states that it's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\n5. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
