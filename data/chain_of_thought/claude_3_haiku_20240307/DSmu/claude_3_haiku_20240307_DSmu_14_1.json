It means that the milk must be in one of the two locations: either on the counter or in the fridge.\n\nThe second statement, \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge,\" negates the possibility that the milk is in the fridge. This implies that the milk cannot be in the fridge.\n\nGiven the first statement and the negation of the second part of the first statement, we can logically conclude that the milk must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes"
