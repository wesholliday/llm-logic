The first premise is \"Either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen.\" This is an \"either-or\" statement, which means that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second premise is \"It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen.\" This means that the second part of the \"either-or\" statement is false.\n\n3. If the second part of the \"either-or\" statement is false, then the first part must be true.

The first premise states that there are two possible scenarios: either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen. This means that if the phone is not in the living room, then it must be ringing in the kitchen.\n\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen. This means that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen.\n\n3. Since the phone is not ringing in the kitchen (from the second premise), and the first premise states that if the phone is not in the living room, then it must be ringing in the kitchen, we can conclude that the phone must be in the living room.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The phone is in the living room.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
