The first statement is: \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\"\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that the watch is not on his wrist.\n4. Since the first statement says that the watch is either charging on the dresser or on his wrist, and we know it's not on his wrist, we can conclude that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes"
