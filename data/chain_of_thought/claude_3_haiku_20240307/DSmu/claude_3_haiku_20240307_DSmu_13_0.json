The first premise is \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\" This means that the toy is either in the toy box or on the bookshelf, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\" This means that the toy is not necessarily on the bookshelf.\n\n3. If the toy is not necessarily on the bookshelf, and it must be either in the toy box or on the bookshelf, then the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
