The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This means that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The apple was not red.\" This means that the antecedent of the conditional statement is false.\n\n3. When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the entire statement is still true, but we cannot infer anything about the consequent (in this case, \"the banana was yellow\").\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot infer \"The banana was not yellow.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
