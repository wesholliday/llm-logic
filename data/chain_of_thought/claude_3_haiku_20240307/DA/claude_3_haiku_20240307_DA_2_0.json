The griffin was not in the forest.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the unicorn was not in the forest, we need to use the rule of modus tollens.\n\nThe rule of modus tollens states that if we have the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and the negation of the consequent (Q), then we can infer the negation of the antecedent (P).\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" The negation of the consequent is \"The griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nApplying the rule of modus tollens, we can infer that \"The unicorn was not in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
