The first statement is \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the consequent (Bob chose pasta) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Sue did not choose pizza.\" This means that the antecedent of the conditional statement is false.\n\n3. When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the entire statement is considered to be true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent.\n\n4. Therefore, from the given information, we cannot infer that \"Bob did not choose pasta.\" The original conditional statement is still true, even though the antecedent is false.\n\nAnswer: no"
