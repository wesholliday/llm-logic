However, the statement does not imply the converse, which would be \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest.\"\n\nThe second statement is a negation of the first part of the conditional statement: \"The griffin was not in the forest.\" This means that the condition \"the griffin was in the forest\" is false.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications.
