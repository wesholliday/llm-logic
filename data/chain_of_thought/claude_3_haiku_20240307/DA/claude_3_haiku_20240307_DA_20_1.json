            "content": "Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:\n\n1. The initial premise is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\". This is a conditional statement, which means that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, it does not necessarily mean that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\n\n2. The second premise is \"The apple was not red\". This contradicts the first part of the conditional statement, which said that the apple was red.\n\n3. From the two premises, we can conclude that the antecedent of the conditional statement (\"the apple was red\") is false. However, this does not allow us to conclude anything about the consequent of the conditional statement (\"the banana was yellow\").\n\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The banana was not yellow\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
