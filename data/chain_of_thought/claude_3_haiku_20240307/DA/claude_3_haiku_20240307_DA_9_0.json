            "content": "To answer this question, let's think through the logic step-by-step:\n\n1. The first statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the consequent (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" This means that the antecedent of the first statement is false.\n\n3. When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the entire statement is considered to be true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent.\n\n4. Therefore, from the two given statements, we cannot infer that \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" The second statement only tells us that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, but it does not provide any information about whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
