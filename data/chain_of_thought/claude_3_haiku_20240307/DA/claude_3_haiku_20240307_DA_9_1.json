            "content": "To answer this, let's think through the logic step-by-step:\n\n1) The first premise is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the consequent (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\n2) The second premise is \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" This means that the antecedent of the conditional statement is false.\n\n3) When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the entire statement is still true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent. This is known as the principle of vacuous truth.\n\n4) Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the truth value of the consequent (Mark bought the blue shirt) based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"

The first statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the conclusion (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" This means that the condition in the first statement is not true.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the logical implication of the first statement when the condition is not true. In a conditional statement, if the condition is false, then the conclusion can be either true or false. We cannot infer anything specific about the conclusion (Mark bought the blue shirt) from this information alone.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot infer \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" The information provided is not sufficient to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"

This means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then we can conclude that Mark bought the blue shirt. However, this statement does not tell us anything about what would happen if Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nThe second statement, \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt,\" tells us that the condition in the first statement is not true. In other words, Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nNow, we need to consider the implications of the first statement in light of the second statement. Since the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is not true, we cannot conclude anything about Mark buying the blue shirt. The first statement only tells us what would happen if the condition is true, but it does not provide any information about what would happen if the condition is false.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot infer that \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" There is not enough information to make this conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
