The first premise is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This means that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n2. The second premise is \"Sam did not take a plane.\" This means that the condition in the first premise is not true, i.e., Sam did not take a plane.\n3. Since the condition in the first premise is not true, we cannot infer anything about Erin's mode of transportation. The first premise only tells us what would happen if Sam took a plane, but it does not tell us what Erin did if Sam did not take a plane.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot infer that \"Erin did not take a train.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
