The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This means that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The car was not red.\" This means that the car was not red.\n\n3. From the first statement, we know that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. However, since the car was not red (according to the second statement), we cannot infer anything about the color of the truck.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The truck was not blue' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
