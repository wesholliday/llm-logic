This is a conditional statement, which means that if the premise (Tom watched football) is true, then the conclusion (Jen watched basketball) must also be true.\n\n2) The second statement is \"Tom did not watch football\". This means the premise of the first statement is false.\n\n3) Now, we need to consider the logical implications. When the premise of a conditional statement is false, the conclusion can still be true or false. The statement \"If P, then Q\" is logically equivalent to \"If not P, then either Q or not Q\".\n\n4) Therefore, from the given information, we cannot infer whether Jen watched basketball or not. The statement \"Jen did not watch basketball\" does not necessarily follow.\n\nAnswer: no"
