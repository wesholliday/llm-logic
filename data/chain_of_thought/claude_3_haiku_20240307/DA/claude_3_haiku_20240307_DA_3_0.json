The second statement is: \"The book was not written by James.\"\n3. We need to determine if we can infer from these two statements that \"The book is not a mystery novel.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the book was written by James) is true, then the conclusion (the book is a mystery novel) is also true.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the condition in the first statement is false, i.e., the book was not written by James.\n\nWhen the condition in a conditional statement is false, we can infer that the conclusion is also false. In other words, if the book was not written by James, then we can infer that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The book is not a mystery novel.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
