The first statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequent (Jen watched basketball) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Tom did not watch football.\" This means that the antecedent of the first statement is false.\n\n3. When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the entire statement becomes true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent. This is known as the principle of vacuous truth.\n\n4. Therefore, even though we don't know whether Jen watched basketball or not, we cannot infer that she did not watch basketball from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
