Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that 'Kate did not eat the salad', we need to consider the structure of the first statement and the negation of the second statement.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which has the form \"If A, then B\". In this case, A is \"Ben ate pasta\" and B is \"Kate ate the salad\".\n\nThe second statement, \"Ben did not eat pasta\", is the negation of the antecedent (A) in the conditional statement.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n- If the antecedent (A) is false, then the conditional statement is still true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent (B).\n- In other words, if Ben did not eat pasta, then the statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\" is still true, but it does not provide any information about whether Kate ate the salad or not.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot infer that \"Kate did not eat the salad\".
