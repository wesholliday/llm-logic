The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n2. The second statement is the negation of the antecedent of the conditional statement: \"The doll was not plastic.\"\n3. When we have a conditional statement and the negation of the antecedent, we can infer the negation of the consequent using the rule of modus tollens.\n4. Applying the rule of modus tollens, we can infer that \"The truck was not metal.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
