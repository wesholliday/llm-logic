The first statement is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the consequent (Kate ate the salad) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Ben did not eat pasta.\" This means that the antecedent of the first statement is false.\n\n3. When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the statement as a whole is considered to be true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent.\n\n4. Therefore, from the given information, we cannot infer that \"Kate did not eat the salad.\" The truth value of the consequent (Kate ate the salad) is unknown.\n\nAnswer: no"
