            "content": "To answer this question, let's think through the logic step-by-step:\n\n1. The first statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequent (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" This means that the antecedent of the first statement is false.\n\n3. When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the entire statement becomes true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent.\n\n4. Therefore, the first statement (\"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\") is true, even though Mary was not at the wedding.\n\n5. However, this does not allow us to infer anything about whether Sue was or was not at the wedding. The first statement only tells us that if Mary was there, then Sue was there, but it does not tell us anything about Sue's actual presence at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no"
