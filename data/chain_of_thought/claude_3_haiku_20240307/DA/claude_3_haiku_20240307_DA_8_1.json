This can be represented as:\nVampire awake \u2192 Mummy awake\n\nThe second statement tells us that the vampire was not awake. This is the negation of the antecedent in the conditional statement.\n\nNow, we can apply the rule of modus tollens, which states that if the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false. In other words, if the mummy was awake, then the vampire must have been awake.
