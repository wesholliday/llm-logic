            "content": "To answer this question, let's think through the logic step-by-step:\n\n1. The first statement is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The vampire was not awake.\" This means that the antecedent of the first statement is false, i.e., the vampire was not awake.\n\n3. From the first statement, we know that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. Since the vampire was not awake, we cannot infer anything about the state of the mummy. The mummy could have been awake or not awake.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The mummy was not awake.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
