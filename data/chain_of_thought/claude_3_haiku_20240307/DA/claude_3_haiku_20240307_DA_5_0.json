The first statement is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the conclusion (Amy playing tennis) is also true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Jeff did not play basketball.\" This means that the condition in the first statement is false.\n\n3. When the condition in a conditional statement is false, the conclusion can be either true or false. In other words, the truth or falsity of the conclusion is not determined by the falsity of the condition.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot infer that \"Amy did not play tennis.\" The conclusion about Amy playing tennis remains unknown.\n\nAnswer: no"
