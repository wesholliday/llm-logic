The first statement is 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\n\n2. The second statement is 'The cake was not chocolate'. This means that the cake was not chocolate.\n\n3. From the first statement, we know that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. However, since the cake was not chocolate, we cannot infer anything about the muffins being blueberry or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The muffins were not blueberry'.\n\nAnswer: no"
