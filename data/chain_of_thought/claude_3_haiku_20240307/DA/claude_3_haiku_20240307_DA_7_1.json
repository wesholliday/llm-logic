The first statement is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Alex finished the race) is true, then the consequent (Chris finished the race) is also true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Alex did not finish the race.\" This is the negation of the antecedent in the first statement.\n\n3. To determine if we can infer \"Chris did not finish the race,\" we need to use the rules of logic.\n\nWhen the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the conditional statement is true. In other words, if Alex did not finish the race, then the statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is still true.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that Chris did not finish the race. The conditional statement only tells us that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.
