The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This means that if Sue chose pizza, then it necessarily follows that Bob chose pasta.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Bob chose pasta.\" This means that Bob did, in fact, choose pasta.\n\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer from these two statements that \"Sue chose pizza.\"\n\n4. Since the first statement tells us that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta, and the second statement tells us that Bob did choose pasta, we can conclude that the antecedent of the conditional statement (i.e., \"Sue chose pizza\") must be true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
