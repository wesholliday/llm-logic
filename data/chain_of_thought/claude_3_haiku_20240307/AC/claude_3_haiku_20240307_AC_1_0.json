The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. However, this does not necessarily mean that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was also at the wedding.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that Sue was present at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's consider the inference:\nCan we infer that \"Mary was at the wedding\" from the given information?\n\nThe answer is:\n\nAnswer: no\n\nThe reason is that the first statement only tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. It does not provide any information about whether Mary was actually at the wedding or not. The second statement tells us that Sue was at the wedding, but this does not necessarily imply that Mary was also at the wedding."
