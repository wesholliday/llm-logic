The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This means that if the condition \"Jeff played basketball\" is true, then the conclusion \"Amy played tennis\" is also true.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Amy played tennis.\" This means that the conclusion \"Amy played tennis\" is true.\n\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer the condition \"Jeff played basketball\" from the given information.\n\nSince the first statement is a conditional statement, the truth of the conclusion \"Amy played tennis\" does not necessarily imply the truth of the condition \"Jeff played basketball.\" The conditional statement only tells us that if the condition is true, then the conclusion is also true, but it does not tell us anything about the truth of the condition itself.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"Jeff played basketball\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
