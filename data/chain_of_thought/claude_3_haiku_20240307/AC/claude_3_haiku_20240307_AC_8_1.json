Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (if A, then B) and the antecedent (A) is true, then we can conclude that the consequent (B) is also true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" The second statement tells us that the mummy was awake, which means the consequent (B) is true.
