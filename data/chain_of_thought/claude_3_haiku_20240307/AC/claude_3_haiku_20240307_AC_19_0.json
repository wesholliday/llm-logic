The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This means that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Jen watched basketball.\" This means that Jen did, in fact, watch basketball.\n3. From the first statement, we know that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. Since we know from the second statement that Jen did watch basketball, we can infer that the condition in the first statement must have been true, which means that Tom watched football.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'Tom watched football'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
