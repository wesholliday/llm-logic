            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'The doll was plastic' from the given information, let's analyze the statements step-by-step:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n2. The second statement is a categorical statement: \"The truck was metal.\"\n3. To infer 'The doll was plastic' from these two statements, we need to use the rule of modus ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (if P, then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then we can conclude the consequent (Q) is true.\n4. In this case, the conditional statement is \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" The second statement, \"The truck was metal,\" confirms the consequent (Q) of the conditional statement.\n5. However, we cannot infer the antecedent (P) from the consequent (Q) and the conditional statement. This would be a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent.\n\nAnswer: no"
