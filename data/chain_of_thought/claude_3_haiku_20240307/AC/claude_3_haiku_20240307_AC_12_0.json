The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This means that if the condition \"Joe went to the park\" is true, then the consequence \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is also true.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" This means that the consequence \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is true.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical reasoning:\n\nIf the first statement is true (the conditional statement), and the consequence of that statement is also true (the second statement), then we can infer that the condition of the first statement is also true. In other words, if the consequence is true, then the condition must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that 'Joe went to the park'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
