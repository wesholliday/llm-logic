The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n4. Since we know that the wolf was in the den, we can apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if p -> q and p are true, then q is also true.\n5. In this case, p represents \"the bear was in the cave,\" and q represents \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n6.

This statement does not tell us anything about the actual location of the bear or the wolf.\n\nThe second statement, \"The wolf was in the den,\" is a simple factual statement that tells us the location of the wolf.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer that 'The bear was in the cave' from the given information?\"\n\nTo infer the location of the bear, we would need to use the first statement, \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den,\" and the second statement, \"The wolf was in the den.\"\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude that \"The bear was in the cave\" from this information.
