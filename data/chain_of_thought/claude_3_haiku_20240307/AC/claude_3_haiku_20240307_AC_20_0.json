The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This means that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"The banana was yellow.\" This statement is true.\n\nNow, let's consider the inference:\nCan we infer 'The apple was red' from the given information?\n\nAnswer: yes\n\nThe reason is that the first statement is a conditional statement, and the second statement affirms the consequent (the banana was yellow). Therefore, we can infer that the antecedent (the apple was red) is also true."
