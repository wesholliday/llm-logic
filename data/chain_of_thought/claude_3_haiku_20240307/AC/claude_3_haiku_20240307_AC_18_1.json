The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n2. The second statement is the antecedent of the conditional statement: \"The truck was metal.\"\n3. From the conditional statement and the second statement, we can apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement and the antecedent is true, then we can infer the consequent is true.\n4.
