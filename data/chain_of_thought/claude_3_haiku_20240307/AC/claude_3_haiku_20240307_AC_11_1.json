The muffins were blueberry.\n\nThe question is: Can we infer that the cake was chocolate?\n\nLet's consider the logical structure of the first statement:\n\"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\nThis is a conditional statement, which means that the statement is true if the antecedent (the cake was chocolate) is true and the consequent (the muffins were blueberry) is also true.\n\nNow, we know from the second statement that the muffins were blueberry. This means that the consequent of the first statement is true.\n\nHowever, from the fact that the consequent is true, we cannot logically infer that the antecedent (the cake was chocolate) is also true. This is because the conditional statement only tells us that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent is true, but it does not tell us the reverse.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no"
