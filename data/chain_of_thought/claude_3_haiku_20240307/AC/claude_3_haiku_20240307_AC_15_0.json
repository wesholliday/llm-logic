The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This means that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Erin took a train.\" This means that Erin did, in fact, take a train.\n3. From the first statement, we know that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. Since we know that Erin did take a train, we can infer that Sam must have taken a plane.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'Sam took a plane.'\n\nAnswer: yes"
