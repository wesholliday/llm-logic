The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\" This means that if Ben ate pasta, then it follows that Kate ate the salad.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Kate ate the salad.\" This means that Kate did, in fact, eat the salad.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical reasoning:\n- If the first statement is true (i.e., \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\") and the second statement is true (i.e., \"Kate ate the salad\"), then we can infer that the antecedent of the first statement is also true, which is \"Ben ate pasta.\"\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"Ben ate pasta.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
