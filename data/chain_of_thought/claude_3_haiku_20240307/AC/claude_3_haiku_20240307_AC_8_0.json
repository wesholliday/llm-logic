However, this does not necessarily mean that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was also awake.\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement: \"The mummy was awake.\" This means that the mummy was indeed awake.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"From 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' together with 'The mummy was awake', can we infer 'The vampire was awake'?\"\n\nTo infer that the vampire was awake, we would need to use the first statement (the conditional statement) and the second statement (the mummy was awake) to conclude that the vampire was also awake.\n\nHowever, the information provided does not allow us to make this inference. The fact that the mummy was awake does not necessarily mean that the vampire was also awake, even though the first statement suggests that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the vampire was awake based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
