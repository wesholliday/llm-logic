The second statement, \"Amy played tennis,\" is a categorical statement that is consistent with the consequence of the first statement.\n\n3.

This is a conditional statement, which means it has the form \"If P, then Q\".\n2. The second premise is 'Amy played tennis'. This is the Q part of the conditional statement.\n3. To infer the P part of the conditional statement (i.e., 'Jeff played basketball'), we would need to use the rule of modus ponens. This rule states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and the antecedent P is true, then we can infer the consequent Q is also true.\n4. However, in this case, we don't have the antecedent P ('Jeff played basketball') as a given premise. We only have the consequent Q ('Amy played tennis') as a premise.\n5.
