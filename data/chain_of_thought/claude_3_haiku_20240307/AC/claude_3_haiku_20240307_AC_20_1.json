This means that it establishes a relationship between the redness of the apple and the yellowness of the banana. Specifically, it states that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nThe second statement, \"The banana was yellow,\" is a simple statement of fact about the color of the banana.\n\nNow, the question is whether we can infer from these two statements that \"The apple was red.\"\n\nTo do this, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it does not necessarily imply that the antecedent (the apple was red) is true, even if the consequent (the banana was yellow) is true.\n\nIn other words, the fact that the banana was yellow does not necessarily mean that the apple was red. There could be other scenarios where the banana was yellow, but the apple was not red.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The apple was red.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
