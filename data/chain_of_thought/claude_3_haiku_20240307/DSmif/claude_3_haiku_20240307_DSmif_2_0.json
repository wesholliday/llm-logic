The first statement is \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf.\" This means that the book is either on the table or on the shelf, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The book might not be resting on the table.\" This means that the book is not necessarily on the table.\n\n3. From the first statement, we know that if the book is not on the table, then it must be on the shelf. \n\n4. Since the second statement tells us that the book might not be on the table, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes"
