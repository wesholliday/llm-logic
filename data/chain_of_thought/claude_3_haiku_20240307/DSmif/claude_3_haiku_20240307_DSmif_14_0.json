The first premise is \"Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter.\" This means that the milk can only be in one of two places: the fridge or the counter.\n\n2. The second premise is \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\" This means that it's possible the milk is not in the fridge.\n\n3. From the first premise, we know that if the milk is not in the fridge, then it must be on the counter.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
