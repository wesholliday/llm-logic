This statement does not provide any information about which of the two possibilities is true.\n\nThe second statement, \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge,\" suggests that the milk may not be in the fridge. This statement does not directly imply that the milk is on the counter, as there could be other possible locations for the milk.\n\nTo infer that \"The milk is on the counter\" from the given information, we would need to conclude that the only remaining possibility is that the milk is on the counter, since the milk might not be in the fridge.\n\nHowever, the information provided is not sufficient to make this inference. The statement \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" does not necessarily mean that the milk is on the counter. There could be other possible locations for the milk, such as on a table or in a different room.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
