The first premise is: \"Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer.\"\n2. The second premise is: \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n3. From the first premise, we know that the notebook must be either on the nightstand or in the drawer. \n4. The second premise tells us that the notebook might not be on the nightstand.\n5.

In other words, the notebook must be either on the nightstand or in the drawer.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand. This means that the first part of the disjunction (\"the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand\") is not necessarily true.\n\nIf the notebook is not on the nightstand, and the disjunction states that it must be either on the nightstand or in the drawer, then the only remaining option is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
