The first statement is 'Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser'. This means that the watch can only be in one of these two locations.\n\n2. The second statement is 'The watch might not be on his wrist'. This means that the watch is not necessarily on his wrist.\n\n3. If the watch is not on his wrist, and it can only be on his wrist or charging on the dresser, then the only remaining possibility is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The watch is charging on the dresser'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
