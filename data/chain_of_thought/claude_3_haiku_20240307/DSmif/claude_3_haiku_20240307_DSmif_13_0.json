The first statement is \"Either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box.\" This means that the toy is either on the bookshelf or in the toy box, and it cannot be anywhere else.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\" This means that it is possible that the toy is not on the bookshelf.\n\n3. If the toy is not on the bookshelf, and it must be either on the bookshelf or in the toy box, then the only other possibility is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
