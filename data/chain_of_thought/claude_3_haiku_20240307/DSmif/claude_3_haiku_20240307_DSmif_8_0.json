The first statement is a disjunction, which means that either one of the two possibilities is true: \"The remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table.\"\n\n2. The second statement is a negation of the first possibility: \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\"\n\n3.
