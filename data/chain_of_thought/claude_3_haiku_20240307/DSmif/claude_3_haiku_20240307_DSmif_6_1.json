The first statement is \"Either the phone must be ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two possibilities must be true, but not necessarily both.\n2. The second statement is \"The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen.\" This means that the first part of the disjunction is false, and therefore, the second part must be true.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that \"The phone is in the living room.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"

We are given the statement: \"Either the phone must be ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room.\"\n2. This statement can be represented logically as: (phone is ringing in the kitchen) OR (phone is in the living room)\n3. We are also given the statement: \"The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen.\"\n4. This means that the first part of the disjunction (phone is ringing in the kitchen) is false.\n5. Since the disjunction is of the form \"A OR B\", and the first part (A) is false, the second part (B) must be true.\n6.

Either the phone must be ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room.\n2.

This is because the first statement presents two mutually exclusive possibilities: either the phone is ringing in the kitchen, or it is in the living room.\n3.
