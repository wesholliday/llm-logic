The first statement is: \"Either the phone must be ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room.\"\n2. This statement is a disjunction, which means that one of the two possibilities must be true, but not both.\n3. The second statement is: \"The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen.\"\n4. This means that the first part of the disjunction, \"the phone must be ringing in the kitchen,\" is false.\n5. Since the disjunction must be true, and the first part is false, the second part, \"the phone is in the living room,\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
