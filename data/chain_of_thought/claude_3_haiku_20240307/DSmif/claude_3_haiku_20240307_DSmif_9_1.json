From the first statement, we can infer that if the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, then it must be in the box.\n4. The second statement tells us that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes"

The first statement is \"Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box\".\n2. This statement presents two possible options for the location of the missing puzzle piece: either it is blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\n3. The second statement is \"The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor\".\n4. This statement eliminates the first option presented in the first statement, which means that the missing puzzle piece cannot be blending in on the floor.\n5. Since the first option has been eliminated, the only remaining option is that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
