This means that Fido is either in the garden or inside, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Fido might not be in the garden\". This means that it is possible that Fido is not in the garden.\n\n3. If Fido might not be in the garden, and he must either be in the garden or inside, then the only other possibility is that he is inside.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that \"Fido is inside\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
