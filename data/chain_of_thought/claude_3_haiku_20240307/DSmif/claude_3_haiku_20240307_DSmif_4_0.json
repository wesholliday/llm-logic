The first statement is \"Either the cat must be playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch.\" This is an \"either-or\" statement, which means that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The cat isn't playing in the bedroom.\" This means that the first part of the \"either-or\" statement is false.\n\n3. Since the first part of the \"either-or\" statement is false, the second part must be true. In other words, if the cat is not playing in the bedroom, then it must be napping on the couch.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The cat is napping on the couch.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
