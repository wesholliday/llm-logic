From the first premise, we know that the book must be either on the table or on the shelf. This is an exclusive or statement, meaning that the book cannot be both on the table and on the shelf.\n4. The second premise tells us that the book might not be resting on the table. This means that it is possible that the book is not on the table.\n5. Combining the information from the two premises, if the book is not on the table, then it must be on the shelf, as those are the only two possibilities according to the first premise.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The book is on the shelf'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
