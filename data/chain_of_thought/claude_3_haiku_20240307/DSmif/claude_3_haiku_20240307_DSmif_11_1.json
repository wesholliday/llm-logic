The first statement, \"Either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway,\" gives us two possible locations for the newspaper: the porch or the driveway.\n\n2. The second statement, \"The newspaper might not be sitting on the porch,\" suggests that the newspaper may not be on the porch.\n\n3.
