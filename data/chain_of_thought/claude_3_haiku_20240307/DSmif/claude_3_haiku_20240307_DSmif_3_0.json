The given statement is: \"Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\"\n2. We are also given the additional information: \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet.\"\n3. The first statement is a disjunction, which means that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n4. Since we know that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, the only remaining possibility is that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
