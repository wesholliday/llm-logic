The first statement is: \"Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack.\"\n2. This statement is a logical disjunction, meaning that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n3. The second statement is: \"The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack.\"\n4. This statement suggests that the first possibility, \"the scarf must be draped on the coat rack,\" is not necessarily true.\n5. If the first possibility is not true, then the second possibility, \"the scarf is stuffed in my backpack,\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
