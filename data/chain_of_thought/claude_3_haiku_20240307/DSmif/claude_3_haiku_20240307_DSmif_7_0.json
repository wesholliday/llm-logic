The first statement is \"Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet.\" This means that the first part of the disjunction is false.\n\n3. Since the first part of the disjunction is false, the second part must be true. In other words, if the umbrella is not in the closet, then it must be in the car.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes"
