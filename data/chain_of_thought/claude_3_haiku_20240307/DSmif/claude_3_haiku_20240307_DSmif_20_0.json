The first statement is: \"Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n3. From the first statement, we know that the sunglasses must be either on her head or in her bag. \n4. The second statement tells us that the sunglasses might not be on her head.\n5. If the sunglasses are not on her head, then the only other possibility from the first statement is that they are in her bag.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
