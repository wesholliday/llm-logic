Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\n2. The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can see that there are only two possible locations for the keys: either they are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer. This is an exclusive or statement, meaning that one of the two options must be true, but not both.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet.

The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet.\n\nTo infer that the keys are in the drawer, we need to use the principle of the excluded middle. This principle states that for any given proposition, either it is true or its negation is true.\n\nIn this case, the proposition is \"The keys are in the drawer.\" The negation of this proposition is \"The keys are not in the drawer.\"\n\nSince we know that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, we can infer that the keys must be in the drawer, as that is the only other possibility given in the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
