The first statement is \"Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car.\"\n2. This statement is in the form of a disjunction, which means that either one of the two conditions must be true.\n3. The second statement is \"The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet.\"\n4. This means that the first condition in the disjunction, \"the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet,\" is false.\n5. Since the disjunction states that either the first condition or the second condition must be true, and the first condition is false, the second condition, \"the umbrella is in the car,\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
