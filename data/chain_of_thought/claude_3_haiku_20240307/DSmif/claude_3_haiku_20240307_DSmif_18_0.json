The first statement is: \"Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n3. From the first statement, we know that the notebook must be either on the nightstand or in the drawer. \n4. The second statement tells us that the notebook might not be on the nightstand.\n5. If the notebook might not be on the nightstand, and it must be either on the nightstand or in the drawer, then the only other possibility is that it is in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
