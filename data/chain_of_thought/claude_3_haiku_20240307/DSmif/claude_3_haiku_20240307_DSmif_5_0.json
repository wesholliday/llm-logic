The first statement is \"Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry.\" This means that the first part of the disjunction is false.\n\n3. Since the first part of the disjunction is false, the second part must be true. In other words, if the cookies are not in the pantry, then they must be in the jar.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
