The first statement is a disjunction, which means that either one of the two possibilities is true: \"The missing sock must be under the bed or it's in the laundry basket.\"\n\n2. The second statement is a negation of the first part of the disjunction: \"The missing sock isn't under the bed.\"\n\n3. From the first statement, we know that if the missing sock is not under the bed, then it must be in the laundry basket.\n\n4. Since the second statement tells us that the missing sock is not under the bed, we can infer that the missing sock must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes"
