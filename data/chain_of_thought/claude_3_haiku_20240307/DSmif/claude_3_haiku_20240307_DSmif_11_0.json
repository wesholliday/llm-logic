The first statement is \"Either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway.\" This means that the newspaper is either on the porch or in the driveway, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The newspaper might not be sitting on the porch.\" This means that it is possible that the newspaper is not on the porch.\n\n3. If the newspaper is not on the porch, and it must be either on the porch or in the driveway, then the only other possibility is that it is in the driveway.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes"
