The first statement is \"Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag.\" This means that the pen is either on the desk or in the bag, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The pen might not be on my desk.\" This means that it is possible that the pen is not on the desk.\n\n3. If the pen might not be on the desk, and it must be either on the desk or in the bag, then the only other possibility is that the pen is in the bag.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
