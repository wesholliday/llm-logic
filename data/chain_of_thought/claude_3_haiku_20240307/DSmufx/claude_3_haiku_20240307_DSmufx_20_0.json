The first statement is \"Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered.\" This means that the fleeg must either be surned or it is bluttered.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned.\" This means that the fleeg is not required to be surned.\n\n3. From the first statement, we know that if the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered.\n\n4. Since the second statement tells us that the fleeg is not required to be surned, we can infer that the fleeg must be bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes"
