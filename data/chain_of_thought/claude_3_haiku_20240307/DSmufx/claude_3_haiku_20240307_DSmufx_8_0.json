The first statement is \"Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked.\" This means that the sprocket must either be daggled or cranked, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled.\" This means that the sprocket is not required to be daggled.\n\n3. From the first statement, we know that if the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked. Since the second statement tells us that the sprocket is not required to be daggled, we can infer that the sprocket must be cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
