The second premise is \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked.\"\n3. From the first premise, we know that there are two possibilities: either the splat must be quanked, or it is morphed.\n4. The second premise tells us that the first possibility (the splat must be quanked) is not the case.\n5. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
