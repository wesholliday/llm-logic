This means that the dreb must either be spened or vroombed, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is \"It's not the case that the dreb must be spened\". This means that the dreb is not required to be spened.\n\n3. From the first premise, we know that if the dreb is not spened, then it must be vroombed. \n\n4. Since the second premise tells us that the dreb is not required to be spened, we can infer that the dreb must be vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
