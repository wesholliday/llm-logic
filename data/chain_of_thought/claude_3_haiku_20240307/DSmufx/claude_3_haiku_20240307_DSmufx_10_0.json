The first premise is \"Either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two statements must be true.\n\n2. The second premise is \"It's not the case that the wug must be garpled.\" This means that the first part of the disjunction, \"the wug must be garpled,\" is false.\n\n3. Since the first part of the disjunction is false, the second part must be true. In other words, \"the wug is sproinged\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that \"The wug is sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
