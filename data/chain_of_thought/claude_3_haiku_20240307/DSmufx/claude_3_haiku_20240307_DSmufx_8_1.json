The first statement is \"Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked.\"\n   This statement is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two options must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled.\"\n   This statement negates the first part of the disjunction, meaning that the sprocket cannot be daggled.\n\n3. If the sprocket cannot be daggled, and the first statement is a disjunction, then the only remaining option is that the sprocket must be cranked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The sprocket is cranked'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
