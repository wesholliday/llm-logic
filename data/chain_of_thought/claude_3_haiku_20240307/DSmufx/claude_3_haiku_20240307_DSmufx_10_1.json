The first premise is \"Either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged.\" This is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n\n2. The second premise is \"It's not the case that the wug must be garpled.\" This is a negation of the first part of the disjunction, which means that the wug cannot be garpled.\n\n3. Since the wug cannot be garpled, and the disjunction states that either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged, we can infer that the wug is sproinged.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
