The first statement is \"Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked.\" This means that the shank must either be nugged or it must be plooked.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the shank must be nugged.\" This means that the shank cannot be nugged.\n\n3. Since the shank cannot be nugged, and the first statement says that it must either be nugged or plooked, the only remaining option is that the shank must be plooked.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
