The first premise is 'Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled'. This means that the zinger must either be smoogled or fraggled, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is 'It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled'. This means that the zinger is not smoogled.\n\n3. Since the zinger is not smoogled, and the first premise states that the zinger must either be smoogled or fraggled, the only remaining option is that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer 'The zinger is fraggled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
