The first premise is \"Either the wug must be bimmed or it is flooped.\" This means that the wug must either be bimmed or it must be flooped, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is \"It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed.\" This means that the wug cannot be bimmed.\n\n3. Given the first premise, if the wug cannot be bimmed, then it must be flooped. This is because the first premise states that the wug must either be bimmed or flooped, and the second premise eliminates the possibility of it being bimmed.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The wug is flooped.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
