The first statement is \"Either the sneg must be sproted or it is crampled.\" This means that the sneg must either be sproted or crampled, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted.\" This means that the sneg is not required to be sproted.\n\n3. From the first statement, we know that if the sneg is not sproted, then it must be crampled. Since the second statement tells us that the sneg is not required to be sproted, we can infer that the sneg must be crampled.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
