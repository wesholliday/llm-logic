This means that the shank must either be nugged or it must be plooked.\n\n2. The second statement is 'It's not the case that the shank must be nugged'. This means that the shank cannot be nugged.\n\n3. Since the shank cannot be nugged (based on the second statement), and the first statement says that it must either be nugged or plooked, the only option left is that the shank must be plooked.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that 'The shank is plooked'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
