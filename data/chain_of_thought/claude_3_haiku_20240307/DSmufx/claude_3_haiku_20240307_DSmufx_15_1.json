The first statement is \"Either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed.\" This means that the dreb must either be spened or vroombed, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the dreb must be spened.\" This means that the dreb cannot be spened.\n\n3. Since the dreb cannot be spened, and the first statement says that it must either be spened or vroombed, the only remaining possibility is that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The dreb is vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
