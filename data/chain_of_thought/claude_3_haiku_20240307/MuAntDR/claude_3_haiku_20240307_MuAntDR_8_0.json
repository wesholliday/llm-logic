This statement does not provide any information about which of the two possibilities is true.\n\nTo infer that \"The restaurant must have been open for limited hours\" from the given statement, we would need to eliminate the other possibility, which is that the restaurant was closed on Monday. However, the given statement does not provide enough information to do so. It is possible that the restaurant was closed on Monday, or it is possible that the restaurant was open for limited hours.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The restaurant must have been open for limited hours\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
