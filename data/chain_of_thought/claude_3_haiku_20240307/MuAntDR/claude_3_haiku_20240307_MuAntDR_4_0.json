This statement does not provide any information about which of the two possibilities is true.\n\nTo infer that \"The meeting must have been cancelled\" from the given statement, we would need to have additional information that rules out the possibility of the meeting being at 2 PM. Without any such additional information, we cannot conclude that the meeting was cancelled. The given statement alone does not allow us to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
