This statement does not specify which of the two scenarios is true.\n\nTo infer that \"The package must have been delivered the day before\" from the given statement, we would need to eliminate the possibility that the package was delivered yesterday. However, the original statement does not provide enough information to do so. It simply states that the package was delivered either yesterday or the day before, without indicating a preference for one scenario over the other.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The package must have been delivered the day before\" from the given statement, as both possibilities are still valid according to the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no"
