This statement does not provide any information about the specific location of the keys, only that they were in one of the two possible locations.\n\nTo infer that \"The keys must have been on the table\" from the given statement, we would need additional information that specifically indicates the keys were on the table. The original statement does not provide this information, as it only states that the keys were either in the drawer or on the table, without specifying which location they were in.\n\nAnswer: no"
