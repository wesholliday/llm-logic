This statement does not necessarily imply that the flight was on time. It only states that the flight was either delayed or on time, but does not specify which of the two is true.\n\nTo infer that \"The flight must have been on time\" from the given statement, we would need additional information or context to rule out the possibility of the flight being delayed. Without any further information, we cannot conclude that the flight was on time.\n\nAnswer: no"
