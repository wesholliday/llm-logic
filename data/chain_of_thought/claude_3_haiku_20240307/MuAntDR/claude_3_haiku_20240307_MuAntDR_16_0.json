This means that the room was cleaned regularly, either on a daily basis or when a request was made.\n\nTo infer that \"The room must have been cleaned upon request\" from this statement, we would need to determine if the room was only cleaned upon request, and not on a daily basis. However, the original statement does not specify that the room was only cleaned upon request - it states that the room was cleaned daily or upon request, which means that both options were possible.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the room was only cleaned upon request based on the given information. The original statement allows for the possibility that the room was cleaned daily, in addition to being cleaned upon request.\n\nAnswer: no"
