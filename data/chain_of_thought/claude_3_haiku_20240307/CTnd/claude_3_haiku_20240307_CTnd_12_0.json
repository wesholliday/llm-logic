It can be represented as:\nIf P, then not Q\n\nTo infer the statement 'If Jane studied long, then she did not study', we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of 'If P, then not Q' is 'If Q, then not P'.\n\nApplying this to the given statement, the contrapositive would be:\nIf Jane studied long, then she did not study.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If Jane studied long, then she did not study' from the given statement 'If Jane studied, then she did not study long'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
