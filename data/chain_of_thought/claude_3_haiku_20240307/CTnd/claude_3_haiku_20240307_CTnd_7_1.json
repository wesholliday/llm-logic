The original statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then not B\". This means that if the customer was served, then he was not served promptly.\n\n2. The statement you are asking about is also a conditional statement, but in the form \"If B, then not A\". This means that if the customer was served promptly, then he was not served.\n\n3. In logic, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. Just because the original statement \"If A, then not B\" is true, it does not automatically mean that the converse \"If not A, then B\" is also true.\n\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
