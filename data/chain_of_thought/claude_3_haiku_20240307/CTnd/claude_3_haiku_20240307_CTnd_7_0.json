The contrapositive of 'If P, then not Q' is 'If Q, then not P'.\n\nApplying this to the given statement, the contrapositive would be 'If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served' from the given statement 'If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
