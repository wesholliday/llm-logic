The contrapositive of 'If it's raining, then it's not raining hard' is 'If it's raining hard, then it's not raining', which is not the same as the proposed inference.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If it's raining hard, then it's not raining' from the given statement 'If it's raining, then it's not raining hard'.\n\nAnswer: no"
