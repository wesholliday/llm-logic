The contrapositive of 'If P, then not Q' is 'If Q, then not P'.\n\nApplying this to the given statement, the contrapositive would be:\n'If instructions were explained clearly (Q), then instructions were not given (not P)'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given' from the given statement 'If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
