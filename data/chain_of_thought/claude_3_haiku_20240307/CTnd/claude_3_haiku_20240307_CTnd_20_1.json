We want to determine if we can infer the statement: \"If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made.\"\n3. The original statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If P, then not Q.\"\n4. To determine if we can infer the statement \"If Q, then not P,\" we need to look at the logical relationship between the original statement and the proposed inference.\n5. The logical relationship between \"If P, then not Q\" and \"If Q, then not P\" is known as the converse. The converse is not always true, even if the original statement is true.\n6.
