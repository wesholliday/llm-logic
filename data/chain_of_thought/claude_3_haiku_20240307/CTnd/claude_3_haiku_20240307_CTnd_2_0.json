The contrapositive of 'If P, then not Q' is 'If Q, then not P'.\n\nApplying this to the given statement, the contrapositive would be 'If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise' from the given statement 'If Ann exercised, then she did not exercise strenuously'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
