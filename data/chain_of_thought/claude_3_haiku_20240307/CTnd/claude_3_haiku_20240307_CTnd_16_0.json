The contrapositive of 'If P, then not Q' is 'If Q, then not P'.\n\nApplying this to the given statement, the contrapositive would be:\n'If the job was completed well, then it was not completed'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the job was completed well, then it was not completed' from the given statement 'If the job was completed, then it was not completed well'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
