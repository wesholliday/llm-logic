The contrapositive of 'If P, then not Q' is 'If Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be 'If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise' from the given statement 'If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
