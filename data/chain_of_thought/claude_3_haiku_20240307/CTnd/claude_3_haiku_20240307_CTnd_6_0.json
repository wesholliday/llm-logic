The contrapositive of 'If P, then not Q' is 'If Q, then not P'.\n\nApplying this to the given statement, the contrapositive would be 'If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed' from the given statement 'If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
