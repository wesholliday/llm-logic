In this case, the contrapositive of 'If the customer was greeted, then they were not greeted warmly' is 'If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted' from the given statement 'If the customer was greeted, then they were not greeted warmly'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
