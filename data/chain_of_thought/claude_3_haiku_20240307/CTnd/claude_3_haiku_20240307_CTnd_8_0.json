The contrapositive of 'If P, then not Q' is 'If Q, then not P'.\n\nApplying this to the given statement, the contrapositive would be:\n'If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed' from the given statement 'If the issue was addressed, then it was not addressed effectively'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
