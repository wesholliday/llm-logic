The contrapositive of 'If P, then not Q' is 'If Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be 'If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared' from the given statement 'If the meal was prepared, then it was not prepared carefully'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
