The contrapositive of 'If P, then not Q' is 'If Q, then not P'.\n\nApplying this to the given statement, the contrapositive would be:\n'If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed' from the given statement 'If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
