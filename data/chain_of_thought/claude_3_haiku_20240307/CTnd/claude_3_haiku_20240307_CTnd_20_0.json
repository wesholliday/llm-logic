The contrapositive of 'If P, then not Q' is 'If Q, then not P'.\n\nApplying this to the given statement, the contrapositive would be:\n'If a strong recommendation was made (Q), then a recommendation was not made (not P)'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
