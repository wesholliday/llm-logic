The contrapositive of 'If P, then not Q' is 'If Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be 'If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied' from the given statement 'If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
