The contrapositive is also a valid logical inference and has the form 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be 'If directions were explained clearly (not Q), then directions were not provided (not P)'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided' from the given statement 'If directions were provided, then they were not explained clearly'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
