The contrapositive of 'If P, then not Q' is 'If Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be 'If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal' from the given statement 'If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
