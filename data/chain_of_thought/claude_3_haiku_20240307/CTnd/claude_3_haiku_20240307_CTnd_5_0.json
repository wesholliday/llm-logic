The contrapositive of 'If P, then not Q' is 'If Q, then not P'.\n\nApplying this to the given statement, the contrapositive would be:\n'If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned' from the given statement 'If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
