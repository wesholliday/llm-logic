This is a conditional statement, where the premise is \"it's raining\" and the conclusion is \"it's not raining hard\".\n\nNow, the question is asking whether we can infer \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining\" from the original statement.\n\nLet's consider the contrapositive of the original statement, which is \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining\". This is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nHowever, the question is asking about a different statement, \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining\". This is not the contrapositive of the original statement, and it is not a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining\" from the original statement \"If it's raining, then it's not raining hard\".\n\nAnswer: no"
