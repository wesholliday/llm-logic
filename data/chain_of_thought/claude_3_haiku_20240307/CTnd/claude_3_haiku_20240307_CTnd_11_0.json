The contrapositive of 'If P, then not Q' is 'If Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be 'If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store' from the given statement 'If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
