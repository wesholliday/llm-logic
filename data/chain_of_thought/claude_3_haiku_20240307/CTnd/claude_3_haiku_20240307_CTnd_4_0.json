This would result in:\nIf Q, then not P\n\nHowever, this is not a valid inference from the original statement. The negation of the antecedent and consequent does not necessarily follow from the given information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study' from the given statement 'If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently'.\n\nAnswer: no"
