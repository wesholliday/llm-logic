The first statement is \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\" This means that the book is not necessarily on the table.\n\n3. If the book is not necessarily on the table, and the first statement says that it must either be on the table or on the shelf, then the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
