This means that Fido is either in the garden or inside, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\". This means that Fido is not necessarily in the garden.\n\n3. Given these two premises, we can infer that Fido must be inside. If Fido is not necessarily in the garden, and he must be either in the garden or inside, then the only remaining possibility is that he is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
