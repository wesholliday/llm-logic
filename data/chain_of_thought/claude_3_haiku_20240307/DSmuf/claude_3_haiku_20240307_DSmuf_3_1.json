This can be represented as:\n\n(Keys are dangling in the cabinet) OR (Keys are in the drawer)\n\nThe second statement, \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet,\" is a negation of the first disjunct. This can be represented as:\n\nNOT (Keys are dangling in the cabinet)\n\nNow, we need to determine if the conclusion \"The keys are in the drawer\" can be logically inferred from the given statements.\n\nGiven:\n1. (Keys are dangling in the cabinet) OR (Keys are in the drawer)\n2. NOT (Keys are dangling in the cabinet)\n\nIf the keys are not dangling in the cabinet (statement 2), and the keys must be either dangling in the cabinet or in the drawer (statement 1), then the only remaining possibility is that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
