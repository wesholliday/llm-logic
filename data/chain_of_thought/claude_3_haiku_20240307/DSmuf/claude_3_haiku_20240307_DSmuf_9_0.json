The first premise is: \"Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\"\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\"\n3. From the first premise, we know that there are two possible locations for the missing puzzle piece: either it is blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\n4. The second premise tells us that the first possibility (the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor) is not the case.\n5. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
