The first premise is \"Either the missing sock must be under the bed or it's in the laundry basket.\" This means that the missing sock must be in one of these two locations.\n\n2. The second premise is \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\" This means that the missing sock cannot be under the bed.\n\n3. Since the missing sock cannot be under the bed, and it must be in either the bed or the laundry basket, the only remaining possibility is that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
