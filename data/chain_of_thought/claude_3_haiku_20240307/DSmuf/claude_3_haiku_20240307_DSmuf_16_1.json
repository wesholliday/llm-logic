The first statement is \"Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\" This is a negation of the first part of the disjunction, which means that the pen cannot be on the desk.\n\n3. Since the pen cannot be on the desk, and the first statement is a disjunction, the only remaining possibility is that the pen must be in the bag.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
