The first statement is 'Either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway'. This statement is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is 'It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch'. This statement negates the first possibility in the disjunction, which is that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch.\n\n3. If we negate the first possibility in the disjunction, the only remaining possibility is that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'The newspaper is in the driveway'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
