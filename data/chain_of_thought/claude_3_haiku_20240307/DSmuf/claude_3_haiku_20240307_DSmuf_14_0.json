The first premise is \"Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second premise is \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\" This means that the milk is not chilling in the fridge.\n\n3. Given the first premise and the negation of the first part of the disjunction, we can conclude that the milk must be on the counter.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
