The first statement is \"Either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch.\" This means that the first part of the disjunction, \"the newspaper must be sitting on the porch,\" is not true.\n\n3. Since the first part of the disjunction is not true, the second part must be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The newspaper is in the driveway.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
