The first statement is \"Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\" This means that the pen cannot be on the desk, as that would be a necessary condition.\n\n3. Given the first statement and the negation of the first part of the disjunction, we can infer that the second part of the disjunction must be true. In other words, the pen must be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
