The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door.\"\n3. The question is: Can we infer from these two statements that \"The shoes are in the closet\"?\n\nLet's think about this logically. The first statement gives us two possibilities: either the shoes are lined up by the door, or they are in the closet. The second statement tells us that the first possibility is not true, which means the second possibility must be true. Therefore, we can infer that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes"
