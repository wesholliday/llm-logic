The first statement is \"Either the phone must be ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen.\" This means that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen.\n\n3. Since the first statement is a disjunction, and the second statement eliminates one of the possibilities (the phone ringing in the kitchen), the only remaining possibility is that the phone is in the living room.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The phone is in the living room.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
