The first statement is a disjunction: \"Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table.\"\n2. The second statement is a negation of the first part of the disjunction: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n3. From the first statement, we know that the remote control must be either under the couch or on the coffee table.\n4. The second statement tells us that the remote control is not under the couch.\n5. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
