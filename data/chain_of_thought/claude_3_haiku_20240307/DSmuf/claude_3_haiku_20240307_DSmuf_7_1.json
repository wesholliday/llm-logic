From the first premise, we can infer that if the umbrella is not tucked away in the closet, then it must be in the car.\n4.

We are given the statement: \"Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car.\"\n2.

The first statement suggests that there are two possible locations for the umbrella: either it is in the closet or it is in the car.\n4.
