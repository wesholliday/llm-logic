The first premise is: \"Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar.\"\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n3. From the first premise, we know that there are two possible locations for the cookies: either they are in the pantry or they are in the jar.\n4.
