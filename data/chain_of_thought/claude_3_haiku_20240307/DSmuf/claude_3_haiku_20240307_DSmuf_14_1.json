The first statement is: \"Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter.\"\n   This statement presents two mutually exclusive possibilities for the location of the milk.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n   This statement negates the first possibility, that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\n\n3.
