The first statement is \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf.\" This means that the book is either on the table or on the shelf, and it cannot be in any other location.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\" This means that the book is not necessarily on the table, but it could be on the shelf.\n\n3. Putting these two statements together, we can infer that the book must be on the shelf.
