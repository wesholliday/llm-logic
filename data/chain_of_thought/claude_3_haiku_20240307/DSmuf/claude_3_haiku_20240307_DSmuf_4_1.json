The first statement is \"Either the cat must be playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch\". This is an \"either-or\" statement, which means that one of the two possibilities must be true, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom\". This means that the first part of the \"either-or\" statement, \"the cat must be playing in the bedroom\", is not true.\n\n3. If the first part of the \"either-or\" statement is not true, then the second part must be true. In other words, if the cat is not playing in the bedroom, then it must be napping on the couch.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The cat is napping on the couch\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
