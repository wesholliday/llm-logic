This is a disjunction, which means that one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second premise is 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden'. This means that the first part of the disjunction, 'Fido must be in the garden', is false.\n3. If the first part of the disjunction is false, then the second part must be true.
