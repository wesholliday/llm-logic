The first statement is: \"Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n3. From the first statement, we know that there are two possible locations for the keys: either they are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\n4. The second statement tells us that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet.\n5. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
