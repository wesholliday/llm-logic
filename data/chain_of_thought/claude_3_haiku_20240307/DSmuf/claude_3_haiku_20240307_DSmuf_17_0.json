The first premise is: \"Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack.\"\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n3. From the first premise, we know that there are two possible options: the scarf is either draped on the coat rack or stuffed in the backpack.\n4. The second premise tells us that the first option (the scarf must be draped on the coat rack) is not true.\n5. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes"
