The first statement is \"Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar.\" This means that the cookies must be either in the pantry or in the jar, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\" This means that the cookies are not in the pantry.\n\n3.
