The first premise is \"Either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box.\" This means that the toy must be in one of these two locations.\n\n2. The second premise is \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\" This means that the toy cannot be on the bookshelf.\n\n3. Since the toy cannot be on the bookshelf (from the second premise) and it must be either on the bookshelf or in the toy box (from the first premise), the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
