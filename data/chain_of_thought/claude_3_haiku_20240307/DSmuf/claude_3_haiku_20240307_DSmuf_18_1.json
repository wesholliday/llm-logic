The first premise is \"Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer\". This means that the notebook must be either on the nightstand or in the drawer, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand\". This means that the notebook cannot be on the nightstand.\n\n3. Since the notebook cannot be on the nightstand (from the second premise), and it must be either on the nightstand or in the drawer (from the first premise), the only remaining possibility is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
