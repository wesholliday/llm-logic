The first statement is \"Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\" This means that the first part of the disjunction, \"the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand,\" is not true.\n\n3. Since the first part of the disjunction is not true, the second part must be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The notebook is in the drawer.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
