This tells us that the wug is not in the state of being bimmed.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the wug is bimmed or it is flooped'. This is a logical disjunction, meaning that the wug must be in one of the two states: bimmed or flooped.\n\n3. Since the first premise tells us that the wug is not bimmed, and the second premise tells us that the wug must be either bimmed or flooped, we can logically infer that the wug must be flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes"
