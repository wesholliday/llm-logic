We are given the statement 'The grommet is not plopped'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'Either the grommet is plopped or it is sploffed'.\n3. The second statement tells us that the grommet must be either plopped or sploffed. Since the first statement tells us that the grommet is not plopped, the only remaining possibility is that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
