The first premise is 'The zinger is not smoogled'.\n2. The second premise is 'Either the zinger is smoogled or it is fraggled'.\n3. From the first premise, we know that the zinger is not smoogled.\n4. From the second premise, we know that the zinger must be either smoogled or fraggled.\n5. Since the zinger is not smoogled (from the first premise), the only remaining possibility is that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that 'The zinger is fraggled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
