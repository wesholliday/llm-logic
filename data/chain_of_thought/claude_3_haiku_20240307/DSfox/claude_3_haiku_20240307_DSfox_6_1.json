'Either the grommet is plopped or it is sploffed'\n\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that the grommet is not plopped.\n\n3. The second statement gives us two possibilities: either the grommet is plopped, or it is sploffed.\n\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the grommet is not plopped, the only remaining possibility is that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The grommet is sploffed'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
