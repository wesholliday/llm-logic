The first premise is 'The whiffle is not tinked'. This means that the whiffle is not in the state of being tinked.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the whiffle is tinked or it is shanked'. This means that the whiffle must be in one of two states: either tinked or shanked.\n\n3. Since the first premise states that the whiffle is not tinked, the only remaining possibility is that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that 'The whiffle is shanked'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
