We are given the statement 'The smonk is not plagged'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'Either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled'.\n3. The second statement is a logical disjunction, meaning that either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled, or both.\n4. Since the first statement tells us that 'The smonk is not plagged', we can infer that the smonk must be vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
