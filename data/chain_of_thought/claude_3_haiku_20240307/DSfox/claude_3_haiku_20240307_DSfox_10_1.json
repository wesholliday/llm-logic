The first premise is 'The wug is not garpled'. This tells us that the wug is not in a state of being garpled.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the wug is garpled or it is sproinged'. This is a logical disjunction, meaning that the wug must be in one of the two states: either garpled or sproinged.\n\n3. Since the first premise tells us that the wug is not garpled, and the second premise states that the wug must be either garpled or sproinged, we can logically infer that the wug must be sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
