We are given the statement 'The flob is not movated'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'Either the flob is movated or it is skizzled'.\n3. The second statement tells us that the flob must be either movated or skizzled. Since we know from the first statement that the flob is not movated, the only remaining possibility is that the flob is skizzled.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that 'The flob is skizzled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
