We are given the statement 'The sprocket is not daggled'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked'.\n3. The second statement is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two possibilities must be true - either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked.\n4. Since the first statement tells us that the sprocket is not daggled, the only remaining possibility from the disjunction is that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The sprocket is cranked'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
