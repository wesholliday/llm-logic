The first premise is 'The wug is not garpled'. This means that the wug is not in the state of being garpled.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the wug is garpled or it is sproinged'. This is a disjunction, meaning that the wug must be in one of the two states: garpled or sproinged.\n\n3. Since the first premise states that the wug is not garpled, and the second premise says the wug must be either garpled or sproinged, we can infer that the wug must be sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
