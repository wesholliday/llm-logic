We are given the statement 'The glip is not tragged'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'Either the glip is tragged or it is slogged'.\n3. From the first statement, we know that the glip is not tragged.\n4. From the second statement, we know that the glip must either be tragged or slogged.\n5. Since the glip is not tragged (from the first statement), the only remaining possibility is that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
