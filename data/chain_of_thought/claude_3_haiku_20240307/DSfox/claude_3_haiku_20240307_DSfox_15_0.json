We are given the statement 'The dreb is not spened'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'Either the dreb is spened or it is vroombed'.\n3. From the first statement, we know that 'The dreb is not spened'.\n4. From the second statement, we can infer that if 'The dreb is not spened', then 'The dreb is vroombed'.\n5. Therefore, we can infer 'The dreb is vroombed' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
