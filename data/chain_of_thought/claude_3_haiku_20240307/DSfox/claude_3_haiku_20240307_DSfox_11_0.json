We are given the statement 'The flug is not zimmed'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'Either the flug is zimmed or it is blummed'.\n3. From the first statement, we know that the flug is not zimmed.\n4. From the second statement, we know that the flug must either be zimmed or blummed.\n5. Since the flug is not zimmed (from the first statement), the only remaining possibility is that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
