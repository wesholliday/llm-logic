In other words, it is possible that the vampire was not awake.\n\nNow, the question asks if we can infer that the vampire might not have been awake. Since the original statement suggests that the vampire's state of being awake is not a certainty, we can infer that the vampire might not have been awake.\n\nAnswer: yes"
