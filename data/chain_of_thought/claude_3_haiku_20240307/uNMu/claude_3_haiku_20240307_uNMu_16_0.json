In other words, it is possible that the pen is not in the bag.\n\nNow, the question is whether we can infer that the pen might not be in the bag. Since the original statement suggests that the pen is not necessarily in the bag, we can logically conclude that the pen might not be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
