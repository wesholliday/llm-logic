In other words, it is possible that the notebook is not in the drawer.\n\nIf it is not necessarily true that the notebook is in the drawer, then it is possible that the notebook might not be in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the notebook might not be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
