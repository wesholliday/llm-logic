This statement does not provide any information about the actual location of the sunglasses.\n\nFrom this statement, we can infer that the sunglasses might not be in her bag. This is because the statement suggests that the sunglasses could be somewhere else, and not necessarily in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
