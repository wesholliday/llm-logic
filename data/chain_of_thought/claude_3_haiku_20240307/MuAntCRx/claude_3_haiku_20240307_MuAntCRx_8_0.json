The original statement only mentions \"wibble\", \"fribble\", and \"zizz\", while the inferred statement introduces new terms like \"blimp\", \"zibble\", and \"plimp\". Without any additional context or rules about the relationships between these terms, there is no way to logically conclude that the inferred statement is a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
