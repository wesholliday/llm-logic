The words \"quazzle\", \"gribble\", \"crunk\", \"quork\", and \"blurble\" are all nonsensical terms that do not have any defined meaning. Without any context or additional information, there is no logical way to infer the second statement from the first. The two statements are completely unrelated and there is no basis to conclude that the second statement is true just because the first statement is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
