The original statement only mentions that the fizzle must gronk at zump wumble, but it does not mention anything about the fizzle snizzling at shimble quazzle. Without any additional context or information, there is no logical way to infer the additional details about the fizzle snizzling at shimble quazzle from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
