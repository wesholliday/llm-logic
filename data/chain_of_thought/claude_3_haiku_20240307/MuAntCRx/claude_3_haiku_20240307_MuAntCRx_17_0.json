The original statement only tells us that the quazzle must be flibbit (a verb) by zizz (another verb), but it does not mention anything about the quazzle being frazzle (another verb) by flibbit (another verb). Without any additional context or information, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no"
