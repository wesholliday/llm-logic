This means that the only way for the truck to be blue is if the car was red.\n5) The conclusion states that if the car was not red, then the truck was not blue. This is the contrapositive of the premise, which is a logically valid inference.\n6) Therefore, the form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
