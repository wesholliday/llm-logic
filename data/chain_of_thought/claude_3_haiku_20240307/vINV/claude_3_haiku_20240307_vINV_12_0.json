            "content": "To determine if the given argument form is logically valid, we need to analyze the relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q,\" where P represents \"Joe went to the park\" and Q represents \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nThe conclusion is also a conditional statement: \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ,\" where \u00acP represents \"Joe did not go to the park\" and \u00acQ represents \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\"\n\nThe logical form of the argument is:\nPremise: P \u2192 Q\nConclusion: \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\n\nThis form of argument is known as the \"contrapositive\" of the original conditional statement. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement, meaning that if the original conditional statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, the given argument form is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
