            "content": "Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:\n\n1) The premise of the argument is: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n2) The conclusion of the argument is: \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\"\n3) To determine if this form of argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n4) The premise tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake. This does not give us any information about what happens if the vampire was not awake.\n5) The conclusion, however, states that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was also not awake. This is a stronger statement than what is implied by the premise.\n6) Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise, and this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
