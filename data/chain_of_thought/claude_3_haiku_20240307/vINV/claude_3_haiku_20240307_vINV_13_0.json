            "content": "To determine if the given argument form is logically valid, we need to analyze the relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q,\" where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\nThe conclusion is also a conditional statement: \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ,\" where \u00acP is \"the car was not red\" and \u00acQ is \"the truck was not blue.\"\n\nThe logical validity of this argument form can be determined by checking if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In other words, we need to check if the conclusion is a valid logical consequence of the premise.\n\nThe argument form \"P \u2192 Q\" and \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\" is known as the contrapositive form, and it is a logically valid form of argument. This means that if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
