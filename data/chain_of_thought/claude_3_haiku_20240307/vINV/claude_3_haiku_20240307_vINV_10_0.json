The contrapositive of the statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nIn this case, the premise is \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside,\" which can be expressed as \"If P, then Q.\" The conclusion is the contrapositive of this statement, which is \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.\"\n\nThe contrapositive is a logically valid form of argument. If the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
