The premise is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This means that whenever the shirt is cotton, the pants are denim.\n2. The conclusion is also a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\" This means that whenever the shirt is not cotton, the pants are not denim.\n3. The conclusion is the logical counterpositive of the premise. The counterpositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n4. A valid logical form is the counterpositive, which means the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
