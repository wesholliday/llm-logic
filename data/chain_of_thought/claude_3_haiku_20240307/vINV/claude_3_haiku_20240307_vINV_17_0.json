            "content": "To determine if the given argument form is logically valid, we need to analyze the relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise is a conditional statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q,\" where P represents \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q represents \"Kate ate salad.\"\n\nThe conclusion is also a conditional statement: \"If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ,\" where \u00acP represents \"Ben did not eat pasta\" and \u00acQ represents \"Kate did not eat salad.\"\n\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In other words, we need to check if the conclusion is a valid logical consequence of the premise.\n\nThe argument form \"P \u2192 Q, therefore \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\" is known as the contrapositive form of the original conditional statement. This form of argument is logically valid, as the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, the given argument form is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
