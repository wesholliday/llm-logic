            "content": "To determine if the given argument form is logically valid, we need to analyze the relationship between the premises and the conclusion using logical reasoning.\n\nThe premise is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This can be represented as the conditional statement:\nP \u2192 Q, where P represents \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q represents \"Kate ate salad.\"\n\nThe conclusion is \"If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad.\" This can be represented as the conditional statement:\n~P \u2192 ~Q, where ~P represents \"Ben did not eat pasta\" and ~Q represents \"Kate did not eat salad.\"\n\nTo determine the logical validity of this argument form, we need to check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. In other words, we need to evaluate whether the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nLet's consider the truth table for the two conditional statements:\n\nP | Q | P \u2192 Q | ~P \u2192 ~Q\n---|---|------|--------\nT | T | T    | T\nT | F | F    | F\nF | T | T    | T\nF | F | T    | T\n\nAs you can see, the truth table shows that the conclusion \"~P \u2192 ~Q\" is logically equivalent to the premise \"P \u2192 Q.\" This means that the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise, and the argument form is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
