            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The document must have been signed and it must have been notarized\" is a compound statement that consists of two parts connected by the conjunction \"and\". This means that both conditions must be true for the overall statement to be true.\n\nThe question is asking whether we can infer the statement \"The document must have been signed and notarized\" from the given statement.\n\nTo determine this, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe given statement \"The document must have been signed and it must have been notarized\" is logically equivalent to the statement \"The document must have been signed and the document must have been notarized\". This is because the conjunction \"and\" requires both conditions to be true.\n\nThe statement \"The document must have been signed and notarized\" is a simpler version of the given statement, as it combines the two conditions into a single statement. This means that if the given statement is true, then the statement \"The document must have been signed and notarized\" must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The document must have been signed and notarized\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
