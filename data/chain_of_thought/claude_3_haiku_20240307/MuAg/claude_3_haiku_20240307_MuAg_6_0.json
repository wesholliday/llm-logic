            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The concert must have been sold out and it must have started at 8 PM\" is a compound statement that consists of two parts: \"The concert must have been sold out\" and \"it must have started at 8 PM\". The use of the word \"and\" in the statement indicates that both parts are true.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM\" from the given statement, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two parts.\n\nThe statement \"The concert must have been sold out and it must have started at 8 PM\" does not necessarily imply that the concert started at 8 PM. The second part of the statement, \"it must have started at 8 PM,\" only indicates that the concert started at 8 PM, but it does not specify that the concert was sold out.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM\" from the given statement, as the information provided is not sufficient to conclude that both parts are true.\n\nAnswer: no"
