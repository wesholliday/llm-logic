            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the statement \"The application must have been completed online and included references\" from the given statement \"The application must have been completed online and it must have included references\", we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe given statement \"The application must have been completed online and it must have included references\" is a conjunction of two conditions: 1) The application must have been completed online, and 2) The application must have included references.\n\nThe statement we are asked to infer, \"The application must have been completed online and included references\", is also a conjunction of the same two conditions.\n\nSince the two statements share the same conjunctive conditions, we can infer that the second statement is true if the first statement is true. In other words, if the application must have been completed online and it must have included references, then it follows that the application must have been completed online and included references.\n\nAnswer: yes"
