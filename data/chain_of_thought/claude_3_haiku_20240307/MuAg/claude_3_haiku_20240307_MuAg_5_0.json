The package must have been delivered today\n2. The package must have been signed for\n\nThe question is asking whether we can infer the statement \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for\" from the given statement.\n\nThe key difference between the two statements is the use of the conjunction \"and\" versus \"it must have been\". In the given statement, the two parts are connected by \"and it must have been\", which suggests that the package being signed for is a separate condition from the package being delivered today.\n\nIn the proposed inference, the two parts are connected by \"and\", which suggests that the package being delivered today and the package being signed for are both true.\n\nSince the given statement does not explicitly state that the package being delivered today and the package being signed for are the same event, we cannot infer the proposed statement with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no"
