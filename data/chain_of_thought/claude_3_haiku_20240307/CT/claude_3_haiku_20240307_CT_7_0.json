It can be expressed in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'Alex finished the race' and Q is 'Chris finished the race'.\n\nTo infer the statement 'If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race', we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be 'If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race' from the given statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
