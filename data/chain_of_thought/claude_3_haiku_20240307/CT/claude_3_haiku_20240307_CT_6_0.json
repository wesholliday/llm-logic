It can be expressed in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P represents 'Sue chose pizza' and Q represents 'Bob chose pasta'.\n\nTo infer the statement 'If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza', we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be 'If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
