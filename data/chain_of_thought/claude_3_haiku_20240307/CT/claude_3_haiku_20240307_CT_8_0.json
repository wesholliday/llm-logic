It states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake. This statement does not directly imply the converse, which would be 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake'.\n\nThe converse of a conditional statement is not always true, even if the original statement is true. To infer the converse, we would need additional information or a stronger logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake'.\n\nAnswer: no"
