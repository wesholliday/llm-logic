However, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nThe converse of the given statement would be \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\". This is not the same as the statement you asked about, which is \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\".\n\nTo determine if the statement you asked about can be inferred from the given statement, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe statement \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\" is the contrapositive of the given statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\". The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, which means that if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"

This means that if Sue chose pizza (A), then Bob chose pasta (B).\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer the inverse of this statement, which is \"If not B, then not A\". In other words, if Bob did not choose pasta (not B), then Sue did not choose pizza (not A).\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we need to consider the truth table for the conditional statement.\n\nThe truth table for the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is as follows:\n\n| A | B | If A, then B |\n|---|---|-------------|\n| T | T | T           |\n| T | F | F           |\n| F | T | T           |\n| F | F | T           |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that the only case where the conditional statement is false is when A is true and B is false. In all other cases, the conditional statement is true.\n\nNow, if we consider the inverse statement \"If not B, then not A\", we can see that it is indeed valid. This is because the only case where the inverse statement is false is when not B is true and not A is false, which corresponds to the case where A is true and B is false in the original conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza' from the given statement 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
