This is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\".\n2) To infer the statement \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\", we need to use the logical principle of the contrapositive. \n3) The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n4) Applying this to the original statement, the contrapositive would be \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
