            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt' from the given statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe given statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement. It can be expressed in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and Q is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nTo infer the statement 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt', we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the given statement would be 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt' from the given statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
