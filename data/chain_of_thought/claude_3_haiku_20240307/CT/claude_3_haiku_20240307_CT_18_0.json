The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement and has the form 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic' from the given statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
