            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding' from the given statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe given statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement. It states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. This statement does not directly imply the converse, which would be 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding'.\n\nTo infer the converse, we would need to apply the logical principle of contraposition. The contrapositive of the given statement is 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding'.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical analysis, we can infer 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding' from the given statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
