The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be 'If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave' from the given statement 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
