            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park' from the given statement 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe given statement 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' is a conditional statement. It states that if the antecedent (Joe went to the park) is true, then the consequent (Lucy went to the zoo) is also true.\n\nTo infer the statement 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park', we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is a logically equivalent statement that has the same truth value as the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' is 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park' from the given statement 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
