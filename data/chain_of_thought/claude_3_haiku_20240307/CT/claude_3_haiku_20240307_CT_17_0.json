It can be represented as:\nIf P, then Q\nWhere P is 'Ben ate pasta' and Q is 'Kate ate the salad'.\n\nThe statement we want to infer, 'If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta', is also a conditional statement. It can be represented as:\nIf not Q, then not P\n\nTo determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe logical relationship between the two statements is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of the first statement is:\nIf not Q, then not P\n\nThis means that the second statement is the contrapositive of the first statement, and we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
