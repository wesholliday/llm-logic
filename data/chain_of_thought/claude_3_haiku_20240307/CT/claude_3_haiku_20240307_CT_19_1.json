In other words, if Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we can use the rules of logic. The converse of a conditional statement is not always true, even if the original statement is true. The converse is only true if the original statement is a biconditional (i.e., \"If and only if A, then B\").\n\nIn this case, the given statement is a conditional statement, not a biconditional.
