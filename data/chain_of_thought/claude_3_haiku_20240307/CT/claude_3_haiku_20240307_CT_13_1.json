This means that the statement is true if the antecedent (the car was red) is true, and the consequent (the truck was blue) is also true.\n\nNow, let's consider the negation of the consequent, which is 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.' This statement is logically equivalent to the statement we are trying to infer.\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we can use the rule of contraposition, which states that if a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is true, then the statement 'If not B, then not A' is also true.\n\nIn this case, the given statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' is a true conditional statement. Applying the rule of contraposition, we can infer that 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red' is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
