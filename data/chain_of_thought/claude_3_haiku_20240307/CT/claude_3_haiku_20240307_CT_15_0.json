It can be represented as:\nIf P, then Q\nwhere P is 'Sam took a plane' and Q is 'Erin took a train'.\n\nTo infer 'If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane', we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is the statement 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be:\nIf Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane' from the given statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
