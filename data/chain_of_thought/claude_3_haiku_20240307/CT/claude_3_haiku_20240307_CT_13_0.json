It can be represented as:\nIf P, then Q\nWhere P is 'the car was red' and Q is 'the truck was blue'.\n\nTo infer the statement 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red', we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nApplying this to the given statement, the contrapositive would be:\nIf the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red' from the given statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
