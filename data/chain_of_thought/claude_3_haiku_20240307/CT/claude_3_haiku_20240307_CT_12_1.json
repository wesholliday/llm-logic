            "content": "Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:\n1) The original statement is: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n2) This statement is in the form of a conditional, which means it has an \"if-then\" structure.\n3) The \"if\" part is that Joe went to the park, and the \"then\" part is that Lucy went to the zoo.\n4) The question is asking whether we can infer the statement \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\"\n5) This new statement is also a conditional statement, with the \"if\" part being that Lucy did not go to the zoo, and the \"then\" part being that Joe did not go to the park.\n6) To determine if this can be inferred from the original statement, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two conditional statements.\n7) If the original statement is true, then the contrapositive of that statement is also true. The contrapositive is the statement \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\"\n8) Therefore, the answer is yes, we can infer \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\" from the original statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
