The first premise is 'The mummy was not awake'. This tells us that the mummy was not in a state of being awake.\n\n2. The second premise is 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake'. This is a conditional statement that suggests if the vampire was in a state of being awake, then the mummy would also be in a state of being awake.\n\n3. Now, we need to consider the logical implications of these two premises. If the mummy was not awake, as stated in the first premise, then the conditional statement in the second premise would imply that the vampire was also not awake.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that 'The vampire was not awake'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
