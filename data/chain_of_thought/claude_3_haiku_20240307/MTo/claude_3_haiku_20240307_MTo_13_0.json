The first statement is 'The truck was not blue'.\n2. The second statement is 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'.\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that if the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\n4. This is because the second statement establishes a conditional relationship between the car being red and the truck being blue.\n5. Since the first statement tells us that the truck was not blue, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
