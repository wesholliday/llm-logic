We are also given the statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\".\n3. From the first statement, we know that Kate did not eat the salad.\n4. From the second statement, we can infer that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate would have eaten the salad.\n5. However, since we know that Kate did not eat the salad, we can conclude that the condition \"if Ben ate pasta\" must be false.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes"

'Kate did not eat the salad'\n2. 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad'\n\nThe key is to understand the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe second statement, 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad', is a conditional statement. It means that if the condition 'Ben ate pasta' is true, then the conclusion 'Kate ate the salad' is also true.\n\nHowever, the first statement, 'Kate did not eat the salad', contradicts the conclusion of the conditional statement. This means that the condition 'Ben ate pasta' cannot be true, as that would require Kate to have eaten the salad, which we know is not the case.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'Ben did not eat pasta' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"

This means that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad.\n4) However, we are also given the first premise: \"Kate did not eat the salad\". This means that Kate did not eat the salad, which contradicts the conclusion that we would draw from the second premise.\n5) Therefore, if Kate did not eat the salad, and if \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\" is true, then we can logically infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes"
