The first statement is 'The truck was not metal'.\n2. The second statement is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n- If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal (according to the second statement).\n- However, the first statement tells us that the truck was not metal.\n- Therefore, the doll cannot be plastic, as that would lead to a contradiction.\n\nAnswer: yes"
