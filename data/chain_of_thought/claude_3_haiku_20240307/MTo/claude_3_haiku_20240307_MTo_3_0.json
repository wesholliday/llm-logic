We are given the following two premises:\n   - \"The book is not a mystery novel\"\n   - \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\"\n\n2. From the second premise, we can infer that if the book is not a mystery novel, then it was not written by James.\n\n3. This is because the second premise states that if the book was written by James, then it would be a mystery novel. But we know from the first premise that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes"
