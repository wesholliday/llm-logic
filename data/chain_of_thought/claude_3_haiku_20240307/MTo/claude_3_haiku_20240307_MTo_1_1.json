We are given the following information:\n   - \"Sue was not at the wedding\"\n   - \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\"\n\n2. From the first statement, we know that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding.\n\n4. Now, let's consider the contrapositive of the second statement. The contrapositive is \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\n5. Since we know from the first statement that Sue was not at the wedding, we can apply the contrapositive to infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes"
