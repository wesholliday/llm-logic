The first statement is 'Lucy did not go to the zoo'. This means that Lucy did not visit the zoo.\n\n2. The second statement is 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Joe went to the park) is true, then the consequent (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true.\n\n3. Since we know from the first statement that Lucy did not go to the zoo, we can infer that the antecedent of the conditional statement must be false. In other words, Joe did not go to the park.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'Joe did not go to the park'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
