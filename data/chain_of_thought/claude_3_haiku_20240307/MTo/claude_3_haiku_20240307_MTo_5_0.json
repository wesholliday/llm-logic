We are also given the statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\".\n3. From the first statement, we know that Amy did not play tennis.\n4. Now, let's consider the second statement. If the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) is true, then the consequent (Amy played tennis) must be true. However, we know from the first statement that Amy did not play tennis.\n5. Therefore, the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) must be false.\n6. In other words, we can infer that \"Jeff did not play basketball\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
