'Lucy did not go to the zoo'\n2. 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be written as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'Joe went to the park' and Q is 'Lucy went to the zoo'.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that 'Lucy did not go to the zoo'. This means that the condition Q in the second statement is false.\n\nNow, let's consider the contrapositive of the second statement, which is 'If not Q, then not P'. This means that 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park'.\n\nSince we have established that 'Lucy did not go to the zoo', we can infer that 'Joe did not go to the park'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
