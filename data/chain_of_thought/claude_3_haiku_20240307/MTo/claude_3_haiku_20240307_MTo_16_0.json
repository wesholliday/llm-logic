The first statement is 'The pants were not denim'.\n2. The second statement is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the shirt was cotton) is true, then the consequent (the pants were denim) must also be true.\n\nHowever, the first statement tells us that the pants were not denim. This contradicts the consequent of the conditional statement, which says that the pants were denim.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the antecedent of the conditional statement, 'the shirt was cotton', must be false. In other words, we can infer that 'The shirt was not cotton'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
