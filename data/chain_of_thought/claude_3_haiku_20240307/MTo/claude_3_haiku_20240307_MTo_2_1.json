From the second premise, we can infer that if the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was also not in the forest.\n4. This is because the second premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. Contraposing this, we get that if the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes"

This tells us that the unicorn was not present in the forest.\n\nThe second statement is 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest as well.\n\nNow, we can use the first statement, 'The unicorn was not in the forest', to infer that the condition in the second statement, 'the griffin was in the forest', must be false. If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin could not have been in the forest either, as the second statement says that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest as well.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The griffin was not in the forest'.\n\nAnswer: yes"

It is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the griffin was in the forest) is true, then the consequent (the unicorn was in the forest) must also be true.\n\nHowever, we know from the first statement that the unicorn was not in the forest.
