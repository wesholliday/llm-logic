We are also given the statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\".\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that if Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\n4. This is because the second statement says that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. The contrapositive of this statement is that if Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes"
