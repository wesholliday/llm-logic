The second statement is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\". This is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part is true (Jeff played basketball), then the second part must also be true (Amy played tennis).\n\n3. However, we know from the first statement that Amy did not play tennis. This means that the second part of the conditional statement, \"Amy played tennis\", is false.\n\n4. Therefore, the first part of the conditional statement, \"If Jeff played basketball\", must also be false.\n\n5. In other words, if the conclusion \"Amy did not play tennis\" is true, and the conditional statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is true, then we can infer that \"Jeff did not play basketball\".\n\nAnswer: yes"

We need to determine if we can infer from these two statements that \"Jeff did not play basketball\".\n\nThe key is to recognize that the second statement is a conditional statement. It states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This means that if Amy did not play tennis (as stated in the first statement), then it must be the case that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"Jeff did not play basketball\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
