We are given the statement 'The banana was not yellow'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'.\n3. The statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' is a conditional statement. It means that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n4. Since the statement 'The banana was not yellow' is true, we can infer that the antecedent of the conditional statement, 'the apple was red', must be false.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that 'The apple was not red'.\n\nAnswer: yes"

It means that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. This statement does not tell us anything about the color of the apple, it only tells us about the relationship between the apple's color and the banana's color.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer 'The apple was not red' from the given information?\"\n\nTo do this, we need to use the principle of contraposition. The contrapositive of the statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\"\n\nSince the first statement tells us that \"The banana was not yellow,\" we can apply the contrapositive to conclude that \"The apple was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
