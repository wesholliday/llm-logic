We are also given the statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\".\n3. From the first statement, we know that Chris did not finish the race.\n4. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Alex finished the race) is true, then the consequent (Chris finished the race) must also be true.\n5. Since we know that Chris did not finish the race, the consequent of the conditional statement must be false.\n6. Therefore, the antecedent (Alex finished the race) must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
