If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nThe question is asking whether we can infer that \"The bear was not in the cave\" from the given information.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement, \"The wolf was not in the den.\"\nThis statement tells us that the wolf was not in the den, but it does not provide any information about the bear's location.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement, \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\"\nThis statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. However, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true.
