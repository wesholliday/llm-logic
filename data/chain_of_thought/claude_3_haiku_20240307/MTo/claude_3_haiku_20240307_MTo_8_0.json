We are given the statement 'The mummy was not awake'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake'.\n3. From the first statement, we know that the mummy was not awake.\n4. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake.\n5. Since we know that the mummy was not awake, we can infer that the condition in the second statement, 'the vampire was awake', must be false.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that 'The vampire was not awake'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
