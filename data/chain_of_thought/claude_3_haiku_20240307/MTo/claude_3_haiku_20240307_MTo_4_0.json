We are also given the statement: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\".\n3. From the first statement, we know that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n4. Now, let's consider the second statement. If the antecedent (the alien visited Mars) is true, then the consequent (the robot visited Jupiter) must be true.\n5. However, we know from the first statement that the robot did not visit Jupiter. Therefore, the antecedent (the alien visited Mars) must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
