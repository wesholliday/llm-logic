This means that the truck was not blue.\n\nThe second statement is 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the car was red, then the truck would have been blue. However, we know from the first statement that the truck was not blue.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the car was not red, as the condition for the truck to be blue (i.e., the car being red) was not met.\n\nAnswer: yes"
