This means that the second statement, \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest,\" is false.\n\nIf the second statement is false, then the antecedent (the griffin was in the forest) must be false as well. This is because the only way for the conditional statement to be false is if the antecedent is true and the consequent is false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
