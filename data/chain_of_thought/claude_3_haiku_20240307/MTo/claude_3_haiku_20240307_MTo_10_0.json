We are also given the statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\".\n3. From the first statement, we know that the cat was not outside.\n4. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n5. However, since we know from the first statement that the cat was not outside, we can infer that the condition \"the dog was inside\" must be false.\n6. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The dog was inside\".\n\nAnswer: no"
