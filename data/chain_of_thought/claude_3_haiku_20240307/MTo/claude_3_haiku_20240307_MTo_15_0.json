We know that \"Erin did not take a train\" (from the first statement).\n2. Since the second statement is a conditional statement, and the consequent (Erin took a train) is false, we can infer that the antecedent (Sam took a plane) must also be false.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that \"Sam did not take a plane\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
