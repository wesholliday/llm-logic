From the second statement, we can infer that if Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\n4. This is because the second statement establishes a conditional relationship between Sue choosing pizza and Bob choosing pasta.\n5. Since we know that Bob did not choose pasta, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes"

If Bob did not choose pasta, then the \"if\" part of the statement (\"If Sue chose pizza\") must be false.\n5) If the \"if\" part of the statement is false, then the entire statement is true.

This is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part is true (Sue chose pizza), then the second part must also be true (Bob chose pasta).\n\n3. However, we know from the first statement that Bob did not choose pasta. This means that the second part of the conditional statement, \"Bob chose pasta\", is false.\n\n4. Since the second part of the conditional statement is false, the first part must also be false, according to the rules of logic.
