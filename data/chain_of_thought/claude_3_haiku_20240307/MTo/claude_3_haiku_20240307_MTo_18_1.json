'The truck was not metal'\n2. 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'\n\nTo infer 'The doll was not plastic', we need to show that the negation of the conclusion (i.e., 'The doll was plastic') leads to a contradiction with the given information.\n\nProof by contradiction:\nAssume that 'The doll was plastic' is true.\nThen, from the second given statement, we can conclude that 'The truck was metal'.\nHowever, this contradicts the first given statement, which states that 'The truck was not metal'.\nTherefore, the assumption that 'The doll was plastic' is false, and we can conclude that 'The doll was not plastic'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
