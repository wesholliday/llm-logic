We are given the statement 'The banana was not yellow'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the apple was red) is true, then the consequent (the banana was yellow) must also be true.\n4. Since we know that 'The banana was not yellow', we can infer that the antecedent of the conditional statement must be false. In other words, 'The apple was not red'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
