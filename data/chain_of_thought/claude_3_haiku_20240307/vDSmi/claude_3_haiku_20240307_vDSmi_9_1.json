The missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n2. The missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor.\n\nPremise 2 states that the second option in the disjunction (the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor) is not necessarily true.\n\nGiven the disjunction in Premise 1 and the negation of one of the disjuncts in Premise 2, the conclusion that the missing puzzle piece is in the box follows logically.\n\nThis type of argument is known as a disjunctive syllogism, and it is a valid form of argument in propositional logic.\n\nAnswer: yes"

This is a negation of the second part of the disjunctive statement in the first premise.\n3) The conclusion states that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.
