This is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second premise is \"The pen might not be on my desk\". This suggests that the pen being on the desk is not a certainty.\n\n3. The conclusion is \"The pen is in my bag\". This follows logically from the two premises, because if the pen is not on the desk (per the second premise), then it must be in the bag (per the first premise).\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
