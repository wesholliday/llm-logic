The first premise presents a disjunction, stating that either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are perched on her head. This is a valid logical statement.\n\n2. The second premise contradicts the second part of the disjunction in the first premise, stating that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head. This effectively eliminates the second part of the disjunction, leaving the first part as the only possible option.\n\n3. The conclusion, which states that the sunglasses are in her bag, follows logically from the premises. Since the first premise provides a disjunction, and the second premise eliminates one of the options, the remaining option must be true.\n\nTherefore, the form of the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
