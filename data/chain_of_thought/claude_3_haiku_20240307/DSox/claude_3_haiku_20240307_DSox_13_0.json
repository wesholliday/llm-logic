We are given the statement 'The glip is not tragged'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'Either the glip is slogged or it is tragged'.\n3. From the first statement, we know that the glip is not tragged.\n4. From the second statement, we can infer that if the glip is not tragged, then it must be slogged.\n5.
