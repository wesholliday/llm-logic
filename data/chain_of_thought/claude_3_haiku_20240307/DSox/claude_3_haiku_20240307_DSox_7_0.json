The first premise is 'The whiffle is not tinked'.\n2. The second premise is 'Either the whiffle is shanked or it is tinked'.\n3. From the first premise, we know that the whiffle is not tinked.\n4. From the second premise, we know that the whiffle must be either shanked or tinked.\n5. Since the whiffle is not tinked (from the first premise), it must be shanked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that 'The whiffle is shanked'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
