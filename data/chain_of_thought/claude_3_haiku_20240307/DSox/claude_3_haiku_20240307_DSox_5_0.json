We are given the statement 'The zinger is not smoogled'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'Either the zinger is fraggled or it is smoogled'.\n3. From the first statement, we know that the zinger is not smoogled.\n4. From the second statement, we know that the zinger is either fraggled or smoogled.\n5. Since the zinger is not smoogled, the only remaining possibility is that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The zinger is fraggled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
