We are given the statement 'The flob is not movated'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'Either the flob is skizzled or it is movated'.\n3. From the first statement, we know that the flob is not movated.\n4. From the second statement, we know that the flob must either be skizzled or movated.\n5. Since the flob is not movated, the only remaining possibility is that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
