'Either the wug is flooped or it is bimmed'\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer 'The wug is flooped' from these premises.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first premise, 'The wug is not bimmed'. This means that the wug is not in the state of being bimmed.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second premise, 'Either the wug is flooped or it is bimmed'. This is a disjunction, which means that the wug is either in the state of being flooped or in the state of being bimmed.\n\nStep 3: Combine the information from the two premises. Since the wug is not bimmed (from the first premise), and the wug is either flooped or bimmed (from the second premise), we can conclude that the wug must be flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes"
