We are given the following two premises:\n   a) \"The flugel is not zargled\"\n   b) \"Either the flugel is blimmed or it is zargled\"\n\n2. From the first premise, we can infer that the flugel is either blimmed or something other than zargled.\n\n3. The second premise states that the flugel is either blimmed or zargled.\n\n4. Combining the information from the two premises, we can conclude that the flugel must be blimmed, as it cannot be zargled (from the first premise) and must be either blimmed or zargled (from the second premise).\n\nAnswer: yes"
