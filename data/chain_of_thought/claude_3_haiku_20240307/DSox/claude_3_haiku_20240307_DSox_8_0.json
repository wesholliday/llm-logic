We are given the following two premises:\n   - \"The sprocket is not daggled\"\n   - \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it is daggled\"\n\n2. From the second premise, we can infer that if the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked.\n\n3. Since the first premise states that \"The sprocket is not daggled\", we can conclude that the sprocket must be cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
