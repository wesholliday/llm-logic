The first premise is 'The wug is not garpled'. This means that the wug is not in the state of being garpled.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the wug is sproinged or it is garpled'. This means that the wug must be in one of two states: sproinged or garpled.\n\n3. Since the first premise states that the wug is not garpled, and the second premise says the wug is either sproinged or garpled, we can infer that the wug must be sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
