We are given the statement 'The grommet is not plopped'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'Either the grommet is sploffed or it is plopped'.\n3. From the first statement, we know that the grommet is not plopped.\n4. From the second statement, we know that the grommet must be either sploffed or plopped.\n5. Since the grommet is not plopped (from the first statement), the only remaining option is that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
