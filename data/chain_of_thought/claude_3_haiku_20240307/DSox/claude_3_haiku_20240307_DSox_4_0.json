We are given the statement 'The fribble is not crinked'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'Either the fribble is snurgled or it is crinked'.\n3. From the first statement, we know that the fribble is not crinked.\n4. From the second statement, we know that the fribble must be either snurgled or crinked.\n5. Since the fribble is not crinked (from the first statement), the only remaining possibility is that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The fribble is snurgled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
