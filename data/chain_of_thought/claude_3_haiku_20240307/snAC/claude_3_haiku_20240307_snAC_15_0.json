We are given two statements:\n   - \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is true.\n   - \"Erin took a train\" is true.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Sam took a plane) is true, then the consequent (Erin took a train) must also be true.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that the consequent (Erin took a train) is true.\n\n4. However, the fact that the consequent is true does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (Sam took a plane) is also true. This is because the conditional statement only tells us that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must be true, but it does not tell us anything about the truth of the antecedent itself.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \"Sam took a plane\" is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no"
