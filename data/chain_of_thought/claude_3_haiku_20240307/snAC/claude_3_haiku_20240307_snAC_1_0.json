We are also given that \"Sue was at the wedding\" is true.\n3. The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequent (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true.\n4. Since we know that the consequent (Sue was at the wedding) is true, we can infer that the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
