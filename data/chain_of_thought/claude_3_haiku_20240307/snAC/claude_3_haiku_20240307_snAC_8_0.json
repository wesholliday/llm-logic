We are also given that \"The mummy was awake\" is true.\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire must have been awake as well.\n4. Since we know the mummy was awake, we can conclude that the vampire must have been awake.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
