The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This means that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. However, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true, meaning that if the muffins were blueberry, it does not necessarily imply that the cake was chocolate.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"The muffins were blueberry.\" This statement is true, as per the given information.\n\n3. The question asks whether the statement \"The cake was chocolate\" necessarily follows from the given information.\n\nThe key point is that the first statement is a conditional statement, and the second statement only confirms the consequent (the muffins were blueberry).
