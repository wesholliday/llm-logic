The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n2. The second statement tells us that the wolf was in the den.\n3. From the first statement, we know that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. However, the second statement only tells us that the wolf was in the den, but it does not tell us anything about the location of the bear.\n4. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"The bear was in the cave\" is necessarily true, even though the other two statements are true.\n\nAnswer: no"
