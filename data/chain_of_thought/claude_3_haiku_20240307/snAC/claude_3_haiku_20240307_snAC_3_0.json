We are given two statements:\n   a) \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is true.\n   b) \"The book is a mystery novel\" is true.\n\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if the book is a mystery novel, then it was written by James. This is because the statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A, then B\".\n\n3. Now, we know that the book is a mystery novel (second statement). Therefore, we can conclude that the book was written by James.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
