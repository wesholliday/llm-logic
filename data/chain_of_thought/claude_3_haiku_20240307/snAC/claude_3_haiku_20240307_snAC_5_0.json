This means that if the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) is true, then the consequent (Amy played tennis) must also be true. However, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. In other words, if the consequent is true (Amy played tennis), it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent is also true (Jeff played basketball).\n\nThe second statement, \"Amy played tennis,\" is true.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Does it necessarily follow that 'Jeff played basketball' is true?\"\n\nTo answer this, we need to look at the logical implications of the given information.\n\nSince the first statement is a conditional statement, and the second statement is true, we can use the rule of modus ponens to conclude that the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) is also true.\n\nHowever, this is not the case. The fact that \"Amy played tennis\" is true does not necessarily mean that \"Jeff played basketball\" is also true. The first statement only tells us that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis, but it does not tell us anything about whether Jeff actually played basketball or not.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no"
