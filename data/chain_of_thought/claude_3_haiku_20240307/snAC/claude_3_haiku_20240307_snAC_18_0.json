            "content": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the given statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This means that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. However, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. Just because the truck was metal, it does not necessarily mean that the doll was plastic.\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement: \"The truck was metal.\" This statement is true.\n\nNow, the question is whether the truth of the first two statements necessarily implies that \"The doll was plastic\" is true.\n\nTo determine this, we need to consider the logical implications of the given information.\n\nThe first statement tells us that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. The second statement tells us that the truck was metal. However, this does not necessarily mean that the doll was plastic. There could be other reasons why the truck was metal, and the doll may have been made of a different material.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it does not necessarily follow that \"The doll was plastic\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
