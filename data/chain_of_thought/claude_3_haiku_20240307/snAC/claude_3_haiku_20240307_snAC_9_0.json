            "content": "To answer this question, let's think through the logic step-by-step:\n\n1. The first statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the consequent (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a true statement.\n\n3. Now, we need to determine if the first statement's antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt) is necessarily true, given the truth of the second statement.\n\n4. Since the second statement is true (Mark bought the blue shirt), and the first statement is a conditional statement, we can infer that the antecedent of the first statement (Lisa bought the red shirt) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
