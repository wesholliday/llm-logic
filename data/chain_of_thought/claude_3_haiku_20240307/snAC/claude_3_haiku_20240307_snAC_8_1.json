If the statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is true, it means that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake either. This is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n2. However, we are given that \"The mummy was awake\" is true. This means that the antecedent of the original statement, \"the vampire was awake,\" must also be true, as the mummy being awake implies that the vampire was also awake.\n\nTherefore, it necessarily follows that \"The vampire was awake\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"

If V, then M (V \u2192 M) is true.\n2.

We know that the conditional statement (V \u2192 M) is true, and we also know that the consequent (M) is true, but we want to determine if the antecedent (V) is necessarily true.\n\nThe rule of modus ponens does not work in this reverse direction.
