We are given that \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" is true.\n2. We are also given that \"The unicorn was in the forest\" is true.\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n4. Since we know the unicorn was in the forest, this means that the antecedent of the first statement (i.e., \"the griffin was in the forest\") must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it necessarily follows that \"The griffin was in the forest\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
