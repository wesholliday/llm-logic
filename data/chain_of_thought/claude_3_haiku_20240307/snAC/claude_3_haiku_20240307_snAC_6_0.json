We are given two statements:\n   - \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is true.\n   - \"Bob chose pasta\" is true.\n\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta. This is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n3. However, we are also given that \"Bob chose pasta\" is true. This means that the antecedent of the first statement, \"Sue chose pizza,\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, it necessarily follows that \"Sue chose pizza\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
