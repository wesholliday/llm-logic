This means that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the cat was outside, then the dog was inside.\n\n2. The second statement, \"The cat was outside,\" is true. This means that the condition in the first statement is satisfied, and therefore, we can conclude that \"the dog was inside\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
