            "content": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the given information and the logical implications.\n\nThe first statement, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding,\" is a conditional statement. This means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there as well. However, this does not necessarily mean that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nThe second statement, \"Sue might not have been at the wedding,\" suggests that it is possible that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer 'Mary was not at the wedding' from the given information?\"\n\nIf we assume that Sue might not have been at the wedding, then the first statement, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding,\" does not provide any information about whether Mary was or was not at the wedding. The fact that Sue might not have been at the wedding does not necessarily imply that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
