The first premise is \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\" This means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob's choice must have been pasta.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Bob might not have chosen pasta.\" This means that it's possible that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the two possibilities:\n   a) If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta (according to the first premise). However, the second premise states that Bob might not have chosen pasta, which contradicts the first premise.\n   b) If Sue did not choose pizza, then the first premise does not apply, and there is no contradiction with the second premise.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'Sue did not choose pizza.'\n\nAnswer: yes"
