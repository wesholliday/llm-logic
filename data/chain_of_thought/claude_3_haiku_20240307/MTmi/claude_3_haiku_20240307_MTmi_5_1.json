If it's possible that Amy did not play tennis, then the original conditional statement (\"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis\") cannot be true. This is because the conditional statement requires that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n\n4) Therefore, if the second statement is true (that Amy might not have played tennis), then the first conditional statement cannot be true.

It suggests that it is possible that Amy did not play tennis.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer 'Jeff did not play basketball' from these two statements?\"\n\nTo answer this, we need to use the principle of contraposition. The contrapositive of the first statement is: \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\" This means that if the consequent (Amy played tennis) is false, then the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) must also be false.\n\nGiven that \"Amy might not have played tennis,\" we can infer that the consequent of the first statement is false.
