The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\"\n2. The second statement is a negation of the consequent of the first statement: \"The pants might not have been denim.\"\n3. From the negation of the consequent, we cannot directly infer the negation of the antecedent. This is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The shirt was not cotton'.\n\nAnswer: no"
