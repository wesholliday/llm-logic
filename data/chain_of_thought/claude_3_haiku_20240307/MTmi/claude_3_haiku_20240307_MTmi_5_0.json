The first statement is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the second part (Amy playing tennis) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Amy might not have played tennis.\" This statement contradicts the second part of the first statement, which said that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n\n3. If the second statement is true, then the second part of the first statement cannot be true. This means that the first part of the first statement, \"If Jeff played basketball,\" must also be false.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
