The first statement is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Sam took a plane) is true, then the second part (Erin must have taken a train) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Erin might not have taken a train.\" This statement contradicts the second part of the first statement, which says that Erin must have taken a train.\n\n3. If the second statement is true, then the first statement cannot be true. In other words, if Erin might not have taken a train, then it cannot be true that if Sam took a plane, Erin must have taken a train.\n\n4. Therefore, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes"
