The first premise is: 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad'. This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is 'Ben ate pasta' and Q is 'Kate ate salad'.\n\n2. The second premise is: 'Kate might not have eaten salad'. This statement is the negation of the consequent (Q) in the first premise.\n\n3. The rules of logic state that when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and the negation of the consequent (not-Q), we can infer the negation of the antecedent (not-P).\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that 'Ben did not eat pasta'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
