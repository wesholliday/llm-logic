The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This means that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The banana might not have been yellow.\" This means that it is possible that the banana was not yellow.\n\n3. From the first statement, we know that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. However, the second statement tells us that the banana might not have been yellow.\n\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The apple was not red\" from the given information. It is possible that the apple was red, and the banana was not yellow.\n\nAnswer: no"
