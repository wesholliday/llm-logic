We are also given the statement: \"The mummy might not have been awake.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\n4. However, the second statement tells us that the mummy might not have been awake.\n5. This means that the first statement's condition, \"if the vampire was awake,\" cannot be true, because if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake, which contradicts the second statement.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes"
