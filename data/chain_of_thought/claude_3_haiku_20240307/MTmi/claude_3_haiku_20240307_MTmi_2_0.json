The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\"\n2. The second statement is the negation of the consequent of the first statement: \"The unicorn might not have been in the forest.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was also not in the forest. This is because the first statement says that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n4. The second statement tells us that the unicorn might not have been in the forest, which means that the griffin was also not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes"
