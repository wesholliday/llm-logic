The first statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. It does not necessarily mean that if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\" This means that it is possible that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's consider the two statements together:\n- If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n- Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot infer that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" The first statement only implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. The second statement simply says that it's possible that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, but it does not provide any information about whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
