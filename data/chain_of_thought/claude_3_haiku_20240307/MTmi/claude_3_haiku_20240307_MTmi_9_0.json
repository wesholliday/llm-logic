The second statement is: \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\"\n3. The question is asking whether we can infer from these two statements that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nLet's think this through:\n* If the first statement is true, then if Lisa bought the red shirt, Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n* However, the second statement says that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\n* This means that the first statement cannot be true, because if Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, then it cannot be true that he must have bought it if Lisa bought the red shirt.\n* Therefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
