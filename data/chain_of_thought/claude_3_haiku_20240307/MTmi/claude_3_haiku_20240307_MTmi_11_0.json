However, this does not necessarily mean that if the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\n\n2. \"The muffins might not have been blueberry\": This statement contradicts the first statement, which said that the muffins must have been blueberry if the cake was chocolate. If the muffins might not have been blueberry, then the first statement is not necessarily true.\n\nHowever, from the given information, we cannot infer that \"The cake was not chocolate.\" The fact that the muffins might not have been blueberry does not necessarily mean that the cake was not chocolate. There could be other possibilities, such as the cake being a different flavor or the muffins being a different flavor.\n\nAnswer: no"
