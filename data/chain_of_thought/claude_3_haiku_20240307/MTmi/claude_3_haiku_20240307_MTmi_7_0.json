The first statement is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Alex finished the race) is true, then the consequent (Chris must have finished the race) is also true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Chris might not have finished the race.\" This statement is the negation of the consequent in the first statement, which means that it is possible that Chris did not finish the race.\n\n3. Now, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. If the consequent of the first statement (Chris must have finished the race) is not true, then the antecedent (Alex finished the race) must also not be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that 'Alex did not finish the race'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
