The second statement is: \"The cat might not have been outside.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\n4. However, the second statement contradicts this, as it says that the cat might not have been outside.\n5. Therefore, if the cat might not have been outside, then the dog could not have been inside.\n6. In other words, the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
