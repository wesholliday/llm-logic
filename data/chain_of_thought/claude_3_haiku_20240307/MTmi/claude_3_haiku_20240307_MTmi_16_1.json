We are also given the premise \"The pants might not have been denim.\"\n3. The question is asking whether we can infer \"The shirt was not cotton\" from these two premises.\n4. Let's consider the implications of the first premise, \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\" This means that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. It does not, however, mean that if the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\n5. The second premise, \"The pants might not have been denim,\" contradicts the first premise, which states that the pants must have been denim if the shirt was cotton.\n6. Since the second premise contradicts the first premise, we cannot infer that the shirt was not cotton. There is not enough information to make that determination.\n\nAnswer: no"
