The first premise is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This means that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue also attended the wedding.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Sue might not have been at the wedding.\" This means that it's possible that Sue did not attend the wedding.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the two premises together. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there (first premise). However, the second premise states that Sue might not have been at the wedding. This means that the first premise cannot be true, as it would contradict the second premise.\n\n4. Therefore, if the two premises are true, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes"
