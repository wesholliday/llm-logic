The second statement is: \"Jen might not have watched basketball.\"\n3. The question is asking whether we can infer from these two statements that \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nLet's think this through:\n- The first statement tells us that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n- The second statement tells us that Jen might not have watched basketball.\n- If Jen might not have watched basketball, then the first statement's condition \"if Tom watched football\" cannot be true, because the consequence \"then Jen must have watched basketball\" would not hold.\n- Therefore, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes"
