However, this does not imply that if the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\n\n2. The second premise is 'The banana might not have been yellow'. This means that we cannot be certain that the banana was yellow.\n\n3. From the given premises, we cannot infer that 'The apple was not red'.
