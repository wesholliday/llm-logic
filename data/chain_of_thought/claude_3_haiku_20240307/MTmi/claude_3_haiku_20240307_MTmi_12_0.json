            "content": "To answer this question, let's think through the logic step-by-step:\n\n1. The first statement is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Joe went to the park) is true, then the consequent (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Lucy might not have gone to the zoo.\" This statement is the negation of the consequent in the first statement, which means that it is possible that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the contrapositive of the first statement, which is \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\" This is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement.\n\n4. Since we know from the second statement that it is possible that Lucy did not go to the zoo, we can infer that it is possible that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
