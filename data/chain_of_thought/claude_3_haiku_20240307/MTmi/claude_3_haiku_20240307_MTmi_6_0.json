The first statement is \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\" This means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob's choice must have been pasta.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Bob might not have chosen pasta.\" This means that it's possible that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the two statements together. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. However, the second statement says that Bob might not have chosen pasta. This means that the first statement cannot be true, as it would contradict the second statement.\n\n4. Therefore, if the second statement is true (that Bob might not have chosen pasta), then the first statement cannot be true, which means that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes"
