The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" This means that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The truck might not have been blue.\" This means that it is possible that the truck was not blue.\n\n3. From the first statement, we know that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. However, the second statement tells us that the truck might not have been blue.\n\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the car was not red. If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue, but the second statement tells us that the truck might not have been blue. This means that the car could not have been red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
