We are also given the statement: \"The robot might not have visited Jupiter.\"\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that it is possible that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n4. If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the first statement (\"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter\") would be false.\n5. If the first statement is false, then the antecedent (\"the alien visited Mars\") must also be false.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that \"The alien did not visit Mars.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
