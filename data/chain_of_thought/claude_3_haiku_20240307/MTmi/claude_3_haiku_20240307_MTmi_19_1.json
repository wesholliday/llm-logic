The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\" This means that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Jen might not have watched basketball.\" This statement is the negation of the consequent in the first statement, which means that Jen might not have watched basketball, even if Tom watched football.\n\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer that \"Tom did not watch football\" from these two statements.\n\n4. The negation of the consequent in the first statement (Jen might not have watched basketball) does not necessarily imply the negation of the antecedent (Tom did not watch football). This is because the conditional statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\" does not imply a biconditional statement, which would be \"Tom watched football if and only if Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
