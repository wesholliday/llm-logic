The first statement, \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry,\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were necessarily blueberry.\n\n2. The second statement, \"The muffins might not have been blueberry,\" is a negation of the consequent of the first statement. This statement suggests that the muffins were not necessarily blueberry.\n\n3. The negation of the consequent does not necessarily imply the negation of the antecedent. In other words, the fact that the muffins might not have been blueberry does not necessarily mean that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The cake was not chocolate' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
