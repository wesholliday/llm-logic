The second statement is: \"The wolf might not have been in the den.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\n4. However, the second statement tells us that the wolf might not have been in the den.\n5. If the wolf might not have been in the den, then it is possible that the bear was not in the cave.\n6. Therefore, from the given information, we cannot infer that \"The bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
