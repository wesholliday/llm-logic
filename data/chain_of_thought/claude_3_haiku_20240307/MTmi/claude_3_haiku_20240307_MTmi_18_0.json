The second statement is: \"The truck might not have been metal.\"\n3. The question is asking whether we can infer from these two statements that \"The doll was not plastic.\"\n\nLet's think this through:\n- The first statement tells us that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n- The second statement tells us that the truck might not have been metal.\n- If the truck might not have been metal, then the first statement's condition (\"if the doll was plastic\") cannot be true. This means that the doll was not plastic.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The doll was not plastic.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
