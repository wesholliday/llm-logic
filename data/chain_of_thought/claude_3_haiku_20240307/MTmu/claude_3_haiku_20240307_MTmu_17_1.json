The first statement, \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad,\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the consequent (Kate must have eaten the salad) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement, \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad,\" is the negation of the consequent in the first statement.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the possible implications. If the consequent (Kate must have eaten the salad) is false, then the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) must also be false, according to the rules of logical implication.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'Ben did not eat pasta'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
