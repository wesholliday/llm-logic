The second premise states: \"It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\"\n3. We need to determine if we can infer from these two premises that \"Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\nLet's consider the first premise, \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Alex finished the race) is true, then the consequent (Chris must have finished the race) must also be true.\n\nNow, looking at the second premise, \"It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race,\" we can see that this contradicts the consequent of the first premise. If it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race, then the first premise cannot be true.\n\nSince the first premise cannot be true, then the antecedent (Alex finished the race) must also be false.
