The first statement is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Alex finished the race) is true, then the consequent (Chris must have finished the race) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\" This is the negation of the consequent from the first statement.\n\n3. Now, we need to consider the logical implications of these two statements. If the consequent of the first statement is false (Chris did not finish the race), then the antecedent (Alex finished the race) must also be false.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that 'Alex did not finish the race'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
