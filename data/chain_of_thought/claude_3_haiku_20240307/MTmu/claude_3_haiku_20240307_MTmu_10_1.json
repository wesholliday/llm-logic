The question is asking whether we can infer from these two statements that \"The dog was not inside.\"\n\nLet's consider the logic:\n- The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\n- The second statement tells us that it is not the case that the cat must have been outside.\n- If the cat was not necessarily outside, then the first statement implies that the dog was also not necessarily inside.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The dog was not inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
