The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\"\n2. The second statement is the negation of the consequent of the first statement: \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\"\n3. From the rules of logic, if the consequent of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent must also be false.\n4. Therefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The cake was not chocolate.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
