The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\n3. To infer \"Sue did not choose pizza,\" we need to use the logical reasoning of contraposition.\n4. The contrapositive of the first statement is: \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n5. Since the second statement tells us that it's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta, we can infer that Bob did not choose pasta.\n6.

The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\n3. The question is asking if we can infer from these two statements that \"Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n4. Let's analyze the first statement. It is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the consequent (Bob must have chosen pasta) must also be true.\n5. However, the second statement says that it's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta. This means that the consequent of the first statement is false.\n6. If the consequent of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent must also be false.\n7. Therefore, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes"

The second statement is \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\n3. To infer \"Sue did not choose pizza,\" we need to use the logical principle of modus tollens.\n4. Modus tollens states that if \"If A, then B\" and \"Not B,\" then we can infer \"Not A.\"\n5. In this case, \"A\" is \"Sue chose pizza\" and \"B\" is \"Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\n6. The first statement gives us \"If A, then B,\" and the second statement gives us \"Not B.\"\n7. Therefore, we can infer \"Not A,\" which is \"Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
