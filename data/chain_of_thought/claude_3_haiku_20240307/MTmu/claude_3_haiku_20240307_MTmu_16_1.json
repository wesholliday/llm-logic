The first statement is: 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.'\n2. The second statement is: 'It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.'\n3. From the first statement, we can see that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. This is a conditional statement.\n4. The second statement tells us that it's not the case that the pants must have been denim. This means that the antecedent 'the shirt was cotton' must be false, otherwise, the consequent 'the pants must have been denim' would be true, which contradicts the second statement.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that 'The shirt was not cotton.'\n\nAnswer: yes"
