            "content": "To answer this question, let's think through the logic step-by-step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" This can be represented symbolically as:\n   \"Vampire awake \u2192 Mummy awake\"\n\n2. The second premise is \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\" This can be represented symbolically as:\n   \"~(Mummy awake)\"\n\n3. Now, let's try to infer \"The vampire was not awake\" from these two premises.\n\n4. Using the first premise, we can say that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\n   \"Vampire awake \u2192 Mummy awake\"\n\n5. However, the second premise tells us that it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\n   \"~(Mummy awake)\"\n\n6. Combining the first and second premises, we can conclude that the vampire must not have been awake.\n   \"Vampire awake \u2192 Mummy awake\" and \"~(Mummy awake)\" \u21d2 \"~(Vampire awake)\"\n\nAnswer: yes"

The first premise is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake as well.\n\n2. The second premise is \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\" This is the negation of the conclusion in the first premise. It means that the mummy was not necessarily awake.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the two premises together. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake (first premise). But the mummy was not necessarily awake (second premise). This means that the vampire could not have been awake, because if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake, and we know that the mummy was not necessarily awake.\n\nTherefore, from the two given premises, we can infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes"
