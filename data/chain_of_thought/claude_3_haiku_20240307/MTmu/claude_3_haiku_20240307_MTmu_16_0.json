The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\"\n2. The second statement is the negation of the consequent of the first statement: \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\"\n3. From the rules of logic, if the consequent of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent of the same conditional statement must also be false.\n4. In this case, the consequent of the first statement is \"the pants must have been denim,\" and this is negated in the second statement.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the antecedent of the first statement, which is \"the shirt was cotton,\" must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
