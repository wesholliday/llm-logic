The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there as well.\n4. However, the second statement tells us that it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\n5. This means that the first statement, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding,\" must be false.\n6. If the first statement is false, then it must be the case that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes"
