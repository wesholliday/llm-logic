It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nLet's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The first statement, \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo,\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the antecedent (Joe went to the park) is true, then the consequent (Lucy must have gone to the zoo) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement, \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo,\" is a negation of the consequent from the first statement. This means that the consequent \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" is false.\n\n3. If the consequent of the first statement is false, then we can infer that the antecedent (Joe went to the park) must also be false. This is known as the principle of modus tollens, which states that if the conditional statement is true and the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
