This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the consequent (Bob must have chosen pasta) must also be true.\n\n2) The second statement is \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta\". This means that the consequent of the first statement is false.\n\n3) If the consequent of the first statement is false, then the antecedent (Sue chose pizza) must also be false, according to the rules of conditional logic.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
