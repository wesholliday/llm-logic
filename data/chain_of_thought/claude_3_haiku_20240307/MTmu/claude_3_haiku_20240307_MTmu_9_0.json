The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n4. The second statement tells us that it is not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This means that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n5. Combining the inferences from steps 3 and 4, we can conclude that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then she must have bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
