The first statement is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Joe went to the park) is true, then the consequent (Lucy must have gone to the zoo) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This is the negation of the consequent in the first statement.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n- If the consequent (Lucy must have gone to the zoo) is false, then the antecedent (Joe went to the park) must also be false, according to the rules of conditional statements.\n- In other words, if Lucy did not have to go to the zoo, then Joe must not have gone to the park.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
