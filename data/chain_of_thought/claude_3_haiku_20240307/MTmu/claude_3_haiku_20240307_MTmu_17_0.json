The first statement is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the consequent (Kate must have eaten the salad) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad.\" This is the negation of the consequent from the first statement.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the logical implications of these two statements:\n   - If the consequent (Kate must have eaten the salad) is false, then the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) must also be false.\n   - This is because the first statement is a conditional statement, and if the consequent is false, then the antecedent must be false as well.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
