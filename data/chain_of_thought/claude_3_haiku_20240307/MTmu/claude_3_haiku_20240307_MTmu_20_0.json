            "content": "To answer this question, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This means that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\n\n2. The second statement is the negation of the consequent of the first statement: \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\" This means that the banana was not necessarily yellow.\n\n3. From the first and second statements, we cannot infer that \"The apple was not red.\" The first statement only tells us that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. The second statement tells us that the banana was not necessarily yellow, but it does not provide any information about the color of the apple.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The apple was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
