            "content": "Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:\n\n1) The first premise is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\n2) The second premise is: \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\n3) Now, let's consider the first premise. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there too. This means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding.\n4) However, the second premise tells us that it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that Sue was not necessarily at the wedding.\n5) Therefore, if Sue was not necessarily at the wedding, and if Mary's presence at the wedding implies Sue's presence, then Mary must not have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes"

            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'Mary was not at the wedding' from the given premises, let's think through the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.' This can be expressed as a conditional statement: \"If P, then Q,\" where P is 'Mary was at the wedding' and Q is 'Sue must have been at the wedding.'\n\n2. The second premise is 'It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.' This is the negation of the consequent Q in the first premise.\n\n3. Using the rules of propositional logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and the negation of the consequent (i.e., \"Not Q\"), we can infer the negation of the antecedent (i.e., \"Not P\").\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer 'Mary was not at the wedding.'\n\nAnswer: yes"

This negates the conclusion of the first statement, meaning that Q is false.\n\n3) From the first statement, we know that if P is true, then Q must be true. However, the second statement tells us that Q is false.\n\n4) Therefore, we can infer that P must be false, since if P were true, then Q would have to be true, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
