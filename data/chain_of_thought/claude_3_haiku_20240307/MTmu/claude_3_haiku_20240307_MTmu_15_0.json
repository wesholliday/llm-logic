The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\"\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that Erin did not take a train.\n4. Now, let's consider the first statement. If Erin did not take a train, then the condition \"If Sam took a plane\" cannot be true, because the consequence \"then Erin must have taken a train\" is false.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes"
