            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The wobble must be wozzle\" does not provide enough information to infer the additional statement \"The wobble must be wozzle and wumble flim fribble\". The original statement only makes a claim about the \"wobble\" being \"wozzle\", but does not mention anything about \"wumble\" or \"flim fribble\". Without any additional context or information, there is no logical way to conclude that the original statement implies the additional statement. The two statements are not directly related, and the second statement introduces new concepts that are not present in the first.\n\nAnswer: no"
