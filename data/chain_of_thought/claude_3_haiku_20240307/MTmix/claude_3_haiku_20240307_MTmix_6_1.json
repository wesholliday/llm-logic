The first statement is: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"The grommet might not have plopped the frink.\"\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that the grommet might not have plopped the frink. This is the negation of the conclusion in the first statement.\n4. If the negation of the conclusion is true, then the premise must be false. In other words, if the grommet might not have plopped the frink, then the grommet must not have been sploffed.\n5.
