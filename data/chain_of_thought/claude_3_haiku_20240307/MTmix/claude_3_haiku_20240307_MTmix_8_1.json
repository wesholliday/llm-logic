The first premise is \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the sprocket was cranked, then it necessarily follows that the sprocket was daggled.\n\n2. The second premise is \"The sprocket might not have been daggled.\" This statement introduces uncertainty about whether the sprocket was actually daggled or not.\n\n3. From the first premise, we know that if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled. However, the second premise suggests that the sprocket might not have been daggled.\n\n4. If the sprocket might not have been daggled, then it follows that the sprocket was not cranked. This is because the first premise states that if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled, but the second premise contradicts this by saying the sprocket might not have been daggled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
