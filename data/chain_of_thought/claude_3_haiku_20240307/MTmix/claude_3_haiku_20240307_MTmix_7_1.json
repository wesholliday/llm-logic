This means that if the whiffle was shanked, then it necessarily follows that the whiffle must have tinked.\n3. The second statement is \"The whiffle might not have tinked.\"\n4. This means that it is possible that the whiffle did not tink.\n5. If the whiffle might not have tinked, then it cannot be true that the whiffle must have tinked (since \"must have tinked\" implies that it did tink).\n6. Therefore, if the whiffle might not have tinked, then the whiffle could not have been shanked.\n7. In other words, we can infer that \"The whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
