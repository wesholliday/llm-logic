The first statement is: \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged.\"\nThis means that if the shank was plooked, then it was also nugged. In other words, being plooked implies being nugged.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The shank might not have been nugged.\"\nThis means that it's possible the shank was not nugged.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the two statements together. If the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged (first statement). But the second statement says that the shank might not have been nugged. This means that the shank could not have been plooked, since being plooked implies being nugged, and the shank might not have been nugged.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
