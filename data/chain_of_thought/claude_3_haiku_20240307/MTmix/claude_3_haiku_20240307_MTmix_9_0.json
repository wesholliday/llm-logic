The first statement is \"If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished.\" This means that if the twonk was plinked, then it was also varnished.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The twonk might not have been varnished.\" This means that it is possible that the twonk was not varnished.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the two statements together. If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished (first statement). However, the second statement says that the twonk might not have been varnished. This means that the twonk could not have been plinked, because if it was plinked, it would have been varnished, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
