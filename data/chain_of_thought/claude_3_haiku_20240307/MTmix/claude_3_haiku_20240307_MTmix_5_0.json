The first statement is \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the zinger was fraggled, then it must have been smoogled.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The zinger might not have been smoogled.\" This statement contradicts the conclusion of the first statement, which is that the zinger must have been smoogled.\n\n3. If the zinger might not have been smoogled, then the first statement, \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled,\" cannot be true. This means that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The zinger was not fraggled.'\n\nAnswer: yes"
