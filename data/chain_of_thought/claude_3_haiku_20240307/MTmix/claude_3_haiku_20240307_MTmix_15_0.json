The second statement is: \"The dreb might not have been spened.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the dreb was vroombed, then it must have been spened.\n4. However, the second statement tells us that the dreb might not have been spened.\n5. This means that the dreb could not have been vroombed, because if it was vroombed, it would have had to be spened, which the second statement says might not have happened.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that \"The dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
