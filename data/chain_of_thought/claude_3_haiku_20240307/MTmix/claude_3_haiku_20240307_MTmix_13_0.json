The second statement is: \"The glip might not have tragged.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged.\n4. The second statement tells us that the glip might not have tragged.\n5. If the glip might not have tragged, then it cannot be true that the glip must have tragged (as stated in the first statement).\n6. Therefore, we can infer that the glip was not slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
