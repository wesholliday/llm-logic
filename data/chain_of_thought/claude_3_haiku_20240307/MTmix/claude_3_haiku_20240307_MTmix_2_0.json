The second statement is \"The wug might not have bimmed the zoint.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint.\n4. The second statement tells us that the wug might not have bimmed the zoint.\n5. If the wug might not have bimmed the zoint, then it cannot be true that the wug must have bimmed the zoint (as stated in the first statement).\n6. Therefore, we can infer that the wug was not flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes"
