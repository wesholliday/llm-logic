In other words, plooked implies nugged.\n3) The second statement is \"The shank might not have been nugged.\"\n4) This means that it is possible that the shank was not nugged.\n5) If the shank might not have been nugged, then it could not have been plooked, since plooked implies nugged.\n6) Therefore, we can infer that \"The shank was not plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
