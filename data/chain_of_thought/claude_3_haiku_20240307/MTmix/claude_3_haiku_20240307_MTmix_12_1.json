The second premise is: \"The smip might not have lupped the zoint.\"\n3. We are asked whether we can infer from these two premises that \"The smip was not shripped.\"\n\nTo infer this, we would need to use a logical reasoning process called modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if \"If A, then B\" and \"Not B,\" then we can conclude \"Not A.\"\n\nIn this case, the first premise is \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint.\" The second premise is \"The smip might not have lupped the zoint,\" which is the negation of the conclusion in the first premise.\n\nTherefore, using modus tollens, we can conclude that \"The smip was not shripped.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"

From statement (a), we can infer that if the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint.
