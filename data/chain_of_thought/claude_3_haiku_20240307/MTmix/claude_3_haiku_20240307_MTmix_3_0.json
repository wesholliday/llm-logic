We are given the following two statements:\n   - \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked\"\n   - \"The splat might not have quanked\"\n\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if the splat was not morphed, then it did not quank. This is because the statement says that if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that the splat might not have quanked. This means that it is possible that the splat did not quank.\n\n4. Combining the two statements, we can infer that if the splat did not quank, then it was not morphed. This is because the first statement tells us that if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked, and the second statement tells us that the splat might not have quanked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The splat was not morphed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
