In other words, the whiffle tinked if and only if it was shanked.\n\n2) The second statement is: \"The whiffle might not have tinked.\"\nThis means that it's possible the whiffle did not tink.\n\n3) Now, let's consider the two statements together. If the whiffle might not have tinked, then it could not have been shanked, because the first statement says that if the whiffle was shanked, then it must have tinked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
