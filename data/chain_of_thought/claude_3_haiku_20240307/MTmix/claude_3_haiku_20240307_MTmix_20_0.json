We are also given the statement \"It might not have been surned.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it was surned.\n4. However, the second statement tells us that it might not have been surned.\n5. If the fleeg might not have been surned, then it could not have been bluttered, because the first statement tells us that if it was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes"
