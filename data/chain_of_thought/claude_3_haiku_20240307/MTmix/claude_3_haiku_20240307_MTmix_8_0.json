The first statement is \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The sprocket might not have been daggled.\" This statement contradicts the conclusion of the first statement, which is that the sprocket must have been daggled if it was cranked.\n\n3. If the sprocket might not have been daggled, then it cannot be true that the sprocket was cranked, because the first statement says that if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
