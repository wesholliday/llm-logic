The first premise is \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged.\" This means that if the clug was fleeked, then it must have also been snugged.\n\n2. The second premise is \"The clug might not have been snugged.\" This means that it is possible that the clug was not snugged.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the two premises together. If the clug was fleeked, then it must have been snugged (first premise). However, the second premise tells us that the clug might not have been snugged. This means that it is possible that the clug was not snugged.\n\n4. If the clug was not snugged, then it cannot have been fleeked, according to the first premise. This means that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
