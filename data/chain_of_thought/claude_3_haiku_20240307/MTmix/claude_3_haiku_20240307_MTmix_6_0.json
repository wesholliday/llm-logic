However, this does not necessarily mean that if the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nThe second statement is: \"The grommet might not have plopped the frink.\"\nThis statement suggests that the grommet might not have plopped the frink, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n- If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink (first statement).\n- The grommet might not have plopped the frink (second statement).\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot infer that \"The grommet was not sploffed.\" This is because the second statement does not provide enough information to determine whether the grommet was sploffed or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
