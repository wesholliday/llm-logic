            "content": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the given information and the logical implications.\n\nThe first statement is: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked. In other words, the snurgling of the fribble is a sufficient condition for the fribble to have crinked.\n\nThe second statement is: \"The fribble might not have crinked.\" This statement suggests that it is possible that the fribble did not crink.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications of these two statements.\n\nIf the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked (first statement). However, the second statement suggests that the fribble might not have crinked. This means that the fribble was not snurgled, as the first statement would not hold true if the fribble did not crink.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The fribble was not snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
