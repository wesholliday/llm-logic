We are given the following two statements:\n   - \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated\"\n   - \"The flob might not have movated\"\n\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if the flob was skizzled, then it must have movated.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that the flob might not have movated.\n\n4. If the flob might not have movated, then it could not have been the case that the flob was skizzled, since the first statement tells us that if the flob was skizzled, then it must have movated.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flob was not skizzled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
