The statement \"Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it is sitting on the porch\" is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true.\n2. The statement \"The newspaper isn't sitting on the porch\" is the negation of the second condition in the disjunction.\n3. If the newspaper is not sitting on the porch, and the disjunction states that it must either be in the driveway or on the porch, then the only remaining possibility is that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes"
