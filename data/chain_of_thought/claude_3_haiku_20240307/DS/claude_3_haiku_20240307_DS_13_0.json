The first statement is \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf.\" This means that the toy must be in one of these two locations.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf.\" This means that the toy cannot be sitting on the shelf.\n\n3. Since the toy cannot be sitting on the shelf, and it must be in either the toy box or on the shelf, the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
