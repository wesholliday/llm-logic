The first statement is \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it tucked away in the closet.\" This is an \"either-or\" statement, which means that the umbrella must be in one of those two locations.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet.\" This means that the umbrella cannot be in the closet.\n\n3. Since the umbrella cannot be in the closet, and the first statement says it must be either in the car or in the closet, the only remaining possibility is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes"
