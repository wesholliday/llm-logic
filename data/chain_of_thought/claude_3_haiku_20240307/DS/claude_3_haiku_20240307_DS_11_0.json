The first statement is \"Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it is sitting on the porch.\" This means that the newspaper must be in one of these two locations.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The newspaper isn't sitting on the porch.\" This means that the newspaper cannot be on the porch.\n\n3. Since the newspaper cannot be on the porch, and it must be either in the driveway or on the porch, the only remaining possibility is that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The newspaper is in the driveway.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
