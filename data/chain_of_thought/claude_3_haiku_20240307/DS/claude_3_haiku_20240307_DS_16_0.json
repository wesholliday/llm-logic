The statement \"Either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk\" is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n2. The statement \"The pen isn't on my desk\" eliminates one of the possibilities, leaving only the other option.\n3. Since the pen is not on the desk, the only remaining possibility is that the pen is in the bag.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
