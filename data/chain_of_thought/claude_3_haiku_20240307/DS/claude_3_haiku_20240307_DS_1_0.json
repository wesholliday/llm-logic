This means that Fido must be in one of those two locations.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Fido is not in the garden\". This means that Fido cannot be in the garden.\n\n3. Since Fido cannot be in the garden, and he must be either inside or in the garden, the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that \"Fido is inside\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
