The second statement is: \"The shoes aren't lined up by the door.\"\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that the shoes are not lined up by the door.\n4. Going back to the first statement, we can see that there are two possibilities: either the shoes are in the closet or they are lined up by the door.\n5. Since we know from the second statement that the shoes are not lined up by the door, the only remaining possibility is that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes"
