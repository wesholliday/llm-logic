The toy isn't sitting on the shelf.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that the toy must be either in the toy box or on the shelf. However, the second statement tells us that the toy is not sitting on the shelf. This means that the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The toy is in the toy box'.\n\nAnswer: yes"

The second premise is \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf.\" This means that the toy cannot be on the shelf.\n\n3.
