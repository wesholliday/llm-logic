This is an \"either-or\" statement, which means that Fido must be in one of the two locations, but not both.\n2. The second statement is \"Fido is not in the garden\". This means that Fido cannot be in the garden, as that would contradict the second statement.\n3. Given that Fido cannot be in the garden, and the first statement says he must be either inside or in the garden, the only possible location for Fido is inside.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
