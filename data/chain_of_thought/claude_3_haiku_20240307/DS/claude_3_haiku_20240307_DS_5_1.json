The first premise states: 'Either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry'.\n   - This premise presents two possible mutually exclusive locations for the cookies: the jar or the pantry.\n\n2. The second premise states: 'The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry'.\n   - This premise eliminates the possibility of the cookies being hidden in the pantry.\n\n3.
