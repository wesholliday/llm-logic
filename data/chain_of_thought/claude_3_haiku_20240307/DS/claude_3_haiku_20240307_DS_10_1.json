The missing sock isn't under the bed.\n\nTo infer \"The missing sock is in the laundry basket,\" we need to use the law of disjunctive syllogism.\n\nThe law of disjunctive syllogism states that if we have two mutually exclusive options (A or B) and one of them is known to be false (not B), then the other option must be true (A).\n\nIn this case, the two mutually exclusive options are:\nA: The missing sock is in the laundry basket.\nB: The missing sock is under the bed.\n\nSince we are given that the missing sock isn't under the bed (not B), we can infer that the missing sock must be in the laundry basket (A).\n\nAnswer: Yes"
