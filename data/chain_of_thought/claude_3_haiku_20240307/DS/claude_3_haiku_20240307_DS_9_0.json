The first statement is: \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it is blending in on the floor.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor.\"\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor.\n4. Going back to the first statement, we can now conclude that the missing puzzle piece must be in the box, since the only other possibility (that it is blending in on the floor) has been eliminated.\n\nAnswer: yes"
