From the first premise, we know that the umbrella is either in the car or in the closet.\n4. However, the second premise tells us that the umbrella is not in the closet.\n5.

The question is asking whether we can infer from these two statements that \"The umbrella is in the car.\"\n\nLet's think about this logically:\n* The first statement gives us two possibilities: the umbrella is either in the car or in the closet.\n* The second statement tells us that the umbrella is not in the closet.\n* If the umbrella is not in the closet, and the only two possibilities are that it's in the car or in the closet, then the only remaining possibility is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nTherefore, we can infer from the given information that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes"
