The given information is:\n   - Either the shoes are in the closet or they are lined up by the door.\n   - The shoes aren't lined up by the door.\n\n2. We can use the logical principle of disjunction elimination to analyze this.\n   - The statement \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they are lined up by the door\" is a disjunction, which means at least one of the two options is true.\n   - Since we are told that the shoes aren't lined up by the door, the only remaining option is that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes"
