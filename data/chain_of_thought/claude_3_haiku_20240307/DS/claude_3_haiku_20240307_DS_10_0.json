The first premise is \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it's under the bed.\" This is an \"either-or\" statement, which means that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second premise is \"The missing sock isn't under the bed.\" This means that the second possibility in the first premise is false.\n\n3. If the second possibility is false, then the first possibility must be true. In other words, if the missing sock is not under the bed, then it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes"
