The first premise is \"Either the milk is on the counter or it is chilling in the fridge.\" This means that the milk must be in one of these two locations.\n\n2. The second premise is \"The milk isn't chilling in the fridge.\" This means that the milk cannot be in the fridge.\n\n3. Since the milk cannot be in the fridge, and it must be either on the counter or in the fridge, the only remaining possibility is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
