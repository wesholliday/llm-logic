Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand.\n2. The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand.\n\nLet's represent the statements using propositional variables:\nLet 'A' represent \"The notebook is in the drawer\".\nLet 'B' represent \"The notebook is sitting on the nightstand\".\n\nThe first statement can be represented as: A \u2228 B (either A or B is true).\nThe second statement can be represented as: \u00acB (not B, i.e., the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand).\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer 'The notebook is in the drawer' from the given information.\n\nUsing the principles of propositional logic, we can reason as follows:\n1. From the first statement, we know that either A or B is true (A \u2228 B).\n2. The second statement tells us that B is not true (\u00acB).\n3. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that A is true, i.e., the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"

The first statement is a disjunctive statement: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand.\" This means that the notebook must be in one of these two locations, but not necessarily both.\n\n2. The second statement is a negation of the second part of the first statement: \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand.\" This means that the notebook cannot be on the nightstand.\n\n3. Given the first two statements, we can conclude that the only possible location for the notebook is in the drawer.
