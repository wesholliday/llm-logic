The first statement is \"Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The book isn't resting on the table.\" This means that the book cannot be resting on the table.\n\n3. Since the book cannot be resting on the table, and the first statement says that it must either be on the shelf or resting on the table, the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
