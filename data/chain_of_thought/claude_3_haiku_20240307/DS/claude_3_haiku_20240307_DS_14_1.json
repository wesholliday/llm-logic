The milk isn't chilling in the fridge.\n\nTo infer that the milk is on the counter, we need to use the logical rule of disjunctive syllogism.\n\nThe disjunctive syllogism states that if we have a disjunction (either/or statement) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false, then the other disjunct must be true.\n\nIn this case, the disjunction is \"Either the milk is on the counter or it is chilling in the fridge.\" We know that the second disjunct, \"the milk is chilling in the fridge,\" is false based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, by the disjunctive syllogism, we can infer that the first disjunct, \"the milk is on the counter,\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
