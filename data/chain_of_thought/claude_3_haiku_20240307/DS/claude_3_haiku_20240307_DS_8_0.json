The first statement is \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch.\" This means that the remote control is in one of these two locations, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\" This means that the remote control is not under the couch.\n\n3. Since the remote control is not under the couch, and it must be either on the coffee table or under the couch, the only remaining possibility is that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
