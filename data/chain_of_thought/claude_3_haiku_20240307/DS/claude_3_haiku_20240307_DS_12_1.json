The first statement is \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it is hanging in the closet.\" This is an \"either-or\" statement, which means that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The jacket isn't hanging in the closet.\" This means that the jacket is not hanging in the closet.\n\n3.
