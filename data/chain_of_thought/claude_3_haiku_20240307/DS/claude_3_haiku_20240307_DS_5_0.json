The first statement is \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry.\" This is an \"either-or\" statement, which means that the cookies must be in one of the two locations, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry.\" This means that the cookies cannot be in the pantry.\n\n3. Since the cookies cannot be in the pantry, and the first statement says they must be either in the jar or in the pantry, the only remaining possibility is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
