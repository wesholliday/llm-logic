The first statement is \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it is hanging in the closet.\" This is an \"either-or\" statement, which means that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The jacket isn't hanging in the closet.\" This means that the jacket is not hanging in the closet.\n\n3. Given the first statement, if the jacket is not hanging in the closet, then it must be draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that \"The jacket is draped over the chair.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
