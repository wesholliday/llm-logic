The statement is \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it is blending in on the floor.\"\n\nThe second statement is the negation of the second part of the disjunction, which says \"The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we can make the following inferences:\n\n1. Since the first statement is a disjunction, and the second statement negates the second part of the disjunction, we can conclude that the first part of the disjunction must be true.\n2. The first part of the disjunction is \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
