We are also given the statement \"The flob was not skizzled\".\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the flob was not skizzled, then the flob was not movated.\n4. This is because the first statement is a conditional statement, and the negation of the antecedent (the flob was not skizzled) implies the negation of the consequent (the flob was not movated).\n\nAnswer: yes"
