The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\" This means that if the twonk was plinked, then it was also varnished.\n\n2. The second statement is a negation of the first part of the conditional statement: \"The twonk was not plinked.\" This means that the twonk was not plinked.\n\n3. Now, we need to consider the logical implications of the two statements. If the twonk was not plinked, then the condition in the first statement is not met. This means that we cannot conclude anything about whether the twonk was varnished or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The twonk was not varnished.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
