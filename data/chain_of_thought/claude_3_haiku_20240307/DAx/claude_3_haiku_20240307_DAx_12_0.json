The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.\"\n2. The second statement is the negation of the antecedent of the conditional statement: \"The smip was not shripped.\"\n3. From the rules of logic, if the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, then the conclusion of the conditional statement is also false.\n4. Therefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The smip did not lup the zoint.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
