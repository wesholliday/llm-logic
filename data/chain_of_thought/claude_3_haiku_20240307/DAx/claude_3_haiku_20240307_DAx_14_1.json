This is a conditional statement, which means that if the clug was fleeked, then the clug was also snugged.\n\nThe second premise is 'The clug was not fleeked'. This directly contradicts the antecedent of the first premise, which states that the clug was fleeked.\n\nGiven that the clug was not fleeked, the consequent of the first premise, which is 'the clug snugged', cannot be true either.
