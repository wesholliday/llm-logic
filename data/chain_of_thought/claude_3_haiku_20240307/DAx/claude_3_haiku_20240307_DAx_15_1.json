Premise 2: \"The dreb was not vroombed.\"\n3. We want to determine if we can infer \"The dreb was not spened.\"\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\" This means that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was also spened. However, the second premise tells us that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implication of these two premises:\n- If the dreb was not vroombed (second premise), then we cannot conclude that the dreb was spened (first premise).\n- In other words, the lack of the antecedent (the dreb being vroombed) means we cannot conclude the consequent (the dreb being spened).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The dreb was not spened\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
