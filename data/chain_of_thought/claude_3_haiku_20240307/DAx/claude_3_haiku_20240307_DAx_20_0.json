The first statement is \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The fleeg was not bluttered.\" This means that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer that \"The fleeg did not surn\" from the given information.\n\n4. Since the first statement is a conditional statement, and the second statement tells us that the condition (the fleeg was bluttered) is false, we can conclude that the consequence (the fleeg surned) is also false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
