The first statement is \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\" This means that if the glip was slogged, then it must have also been tragged.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The glip was not slogged.\" This means that the glip was not slogged.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the first statement again. If the glip was not slogged, then we cannot infer that the glip was tragged. The first statement only tells us that if the glip was slogged, then it was tragged, but it does not tell us anything about the case where the glip was not slogged.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The glip was not tragged.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
