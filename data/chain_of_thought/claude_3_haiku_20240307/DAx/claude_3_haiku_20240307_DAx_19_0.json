We are also given the statement \"The smonk was not vreebled.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was also not plagged.\n4. Since we know from the second statement that the smonk was not vreebled, we can conclude that the smonk was also not plagged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
