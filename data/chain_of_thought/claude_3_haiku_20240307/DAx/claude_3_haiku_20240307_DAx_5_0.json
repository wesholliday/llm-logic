The first statement is 'If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the zinger was fraggled, then it must have also been smoogled.\n\n2. The second statement is 'The zinger was not fraggled'. This means that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\n3. Since the first statement is a conditional statement, and the second statement tells us that the condition (the zinger was fraggled) is not true, we can conclude that the consequence (the zinger was smoogled) is also not true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The zinger was not smoogled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
