The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n2. The second statement is the negation of the antecedent of the conditional statement: \"The grommet was not sploffed.\"\n3. From the rules of logic, if the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, then the entire conditional statement is true.\n4. Therefore, if the grommet was not sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink.\n\nAnswer: yes"
