We are given the premises:\n   - \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\"\n   - \"The twonk was not plinked\"\n\n2. The first premise establishes a conditional statement: \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\" This means that if the twonk was plinked, it must have also been varnished.\n\n3. The second premise tells us that \"The twonk was not plinked.\" This means that the condition in the first premise, \"the twonk was plinked,\" is not true.\n\n4. Since the condition in the first premise is not true, the conclusion \"the twonk was varnished\" cannot be inferred. In other words, if the twonk was not plinked, we cannot conclude that it was varnished.\n\nAnswer: no"
