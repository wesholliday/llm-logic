We are given the statements:\n   - \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\"\n   - \"The splat was not morphed\"\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement. It says that if the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that the splat was not morphed.\n\n4. If the splat was not morphed, then the antecedent of the conditional statement is false. This means that the consequent of the conditional statement (the splat quanked) is also false.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The splat did not quank\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
