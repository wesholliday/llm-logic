The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\" This means that if the flugel was blimmed, then it must have also been zargled.\n\n2. The second statement is a negation of the first part of the conditional statement: \"The flugel was not blimmed.\" This means that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\n3. Now, we need to consider the logical implications of the two statements. Since the flugel was not blimmed, the condition in the first statement is not met. This means that we cannot conclude anything about whether the flugel was zargled or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The flugel was not zargled.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
