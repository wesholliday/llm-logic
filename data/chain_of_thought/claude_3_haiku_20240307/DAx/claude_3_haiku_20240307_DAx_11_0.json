We are also given the statement \"The flug was not blummed.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the flug was not blummed, then the flug was also not zimmed.\n4. This is because the first statement is a conditional statement, and the negation of the antecedent (the flug was not blummed) implies the negation of the consequent (the flug was not zimmed).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The flug was not zimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
