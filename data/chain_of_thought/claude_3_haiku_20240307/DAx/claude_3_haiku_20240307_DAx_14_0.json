We are also given the statement \"The clug was not fleeked.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged.\n4. This is because the first statement is a conditional statement, and the negation of the antecedent (the clug was not fleeked) implies the negation of the consequent (the clug was not snugged).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The clug was not snugged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
