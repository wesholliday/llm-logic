The first statement is \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the wug was sproinged, then it was also garpled.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The wug was not sproinged.\" This means that the condition in the first statement is not true, i.e., the wug was not sproinged.\n\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer that \"The wug was not garpled\" from the given information.\n\nSince the first statement is a conditional statement, and the condition (the wug was sproinged) is not true, we can use the logical principle of modus tollens to conclude that the consequent (the wug was garpled) is also not true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The wug was not garpled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
