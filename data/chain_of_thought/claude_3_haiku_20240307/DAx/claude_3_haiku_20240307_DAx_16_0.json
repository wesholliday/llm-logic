The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\"\n2. The second statement is the negation of the antecedent of the conditional statement: \"The sneg was not crampled.\"\n3. From the rules of logic, when we have a conditional statement and the negation of the antecedent, we can infer the negation of the consequent.\n4. Therefore, from the given information, we can infer \"The sneg did not sprot the frink.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
