We are also given the statement: \"The dreb was not vroombed.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the dreb was not vroombed, then it was also not spened.\n4. This is because the first statement is a conditional statement, and the negation of the antecedent (the dreb was not vroombed) implies the negation of the consequent (the dreb was not spened).\n\nAnswer: yes"
