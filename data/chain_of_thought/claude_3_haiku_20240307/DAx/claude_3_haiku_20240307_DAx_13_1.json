This means that if the glip was slogged, then it follows that the glip was tragged.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The glip was not slogged.\" This means that the glip was not slogged.\n\nNow, let's try to draw an inference from these two statements.\n\nIf the glip was not slogged, and the statement \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\" is true, then we cannot conclude that the glip was tragged. The reason is that the antecedent of the conditional statement (\"the glip was slogged\") is false, and therefore, we cannot infer the consequent (\"the glip was tragged\").\n\nIn other words, the fact that the glip was not slogged does not necessarily mean that the glip was not tragged. There is not enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
