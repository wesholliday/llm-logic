The second statement is the negation of the antecedent of the conditional statement: \"The whiffle was not shanked.\"\n3. From the conditional statement and the negation of the antecedent, we can infer the negation of the consequent using the rule of modus tollens.\n4. Modus tollens states that if \"If P, then Q\" and \"not P\", then we can conclude \"not Q\".\n5. Applying this to the given statements, we can infer \"The whiffle did not tink.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
