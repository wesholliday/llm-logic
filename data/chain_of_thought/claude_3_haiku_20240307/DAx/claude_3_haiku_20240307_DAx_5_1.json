The conclusion we are trying to infer is 'The zinger was not smoogled'.\n\nLet's think through this step-by-step:\n- The first premise states that if the zinger was fraggled, then it was also smoogled.\n- The second premise tells us that the zinger was not fraggled.\n- Therefore, since the zinger was not fraggled, the first part of the conditional statement ('If the zinger was fraggled...') is false.\n- When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the entire conditional statement is true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent.\n- So, even though we don't know if the zinger was actually smoogled or not, we can infer that 'The zinger was not smoogled' based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
