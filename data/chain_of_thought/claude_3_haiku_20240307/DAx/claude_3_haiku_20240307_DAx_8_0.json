However, the second statement tells us that \"The sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n- If the sprocket was not cranked, then the condition in the first statement is not met.\n- If the condition in the first statement is not met, then we cannot conclude that the sprocket was daggled.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot infer that \"The sprocket was not daggled.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
