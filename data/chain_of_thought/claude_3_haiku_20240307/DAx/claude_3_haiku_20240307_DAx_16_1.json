The second statement is the negation of the antecedent of the conditional statement: \"The sneg was not crampled.\"\n3. When the antecedent of a conditional statement is negated, the consequent cannot be inferred with certainty.\n4. This is known as the principle of denying the antecedent, which is a logical fallacy.
