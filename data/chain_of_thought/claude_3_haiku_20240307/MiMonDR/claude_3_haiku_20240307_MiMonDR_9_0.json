The statement only suggests that there is a possibility that the package will be delivered, but it does not provide any information about the possibility of the package being delayed.\n\nTo infer that the package might be delayed or delivered, we would need additional information or context that suggests the package could potentially be delayed. The original statement alone does not provide enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
