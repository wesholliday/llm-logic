This is because the statement only suggests the possibility of the flight being delayed, but does not provide any information about the possibility of the flight being on time.\n\nThe statement \"The flight might be delayed\" is a weaker statement than \"The flight might be on time or delayed.\" The former only indicates the possibility of a delay, while the latter suggests that the flight could either be on time or delayed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The flight might be on time or delayed\" from the statement \"The flight might be delayed.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
