The statement only suggests the possibility of the concert being sold out, but does not explicitly mention the possibility of available tickets.\n\nTo infer that the concert \"might have available tickets or be sold out\", we would need additional information about the concert's ticket availability. The original statement does not give any indication of whether there are still tickets available or if the concert is completely sold out.\n\nAnswer: no"
