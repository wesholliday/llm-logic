The original statement only suggests the possibility of the team winning, but does not explicitly mention the possibility of the team losing.\n\nHowever, we can infer that if the team might win the game, then it is also possible that the team might lose the game. This is because in a game, the outcome can only be either a win or a loss (or a tie, which is not mentioned in the original statement).\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"The team might win the game,\" we can infer that \"The team might lose or win the game.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
