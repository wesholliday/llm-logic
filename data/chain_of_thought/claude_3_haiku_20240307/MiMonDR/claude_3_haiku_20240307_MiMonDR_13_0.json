It only suggests that there is a possibility that the meeting might be cancelled, without making any definitive statement about whether the meeting is scheduled or not.\n\nHowever, the statement \"The meeting might be scheduled or cancelled\" is a broader statement that encompasses both the possibility of the meeting being scheduled and the possibility of it being cancelled. This statement suggests that the meeting is scheduled, and there is a possibility that it might be cancelled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer \"The meeting might be scheduled or cancelled\" from the original statement \"The meeting might be cancelled\" because the original statement does not provide information about whether the meeting is scheduled or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
