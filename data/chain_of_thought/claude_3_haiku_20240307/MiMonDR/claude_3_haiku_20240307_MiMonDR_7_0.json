The statement only suggests that there is a possibility that the train might be late, but it does not provide any information about the possibility of the train being on time.\n\nThe statement \"The train might be late\" is a weaker statement than \"The train might be on time or late.\" The former statement only indicates that there is a possibility of the train being late, while the latter statement suggests that the train could be either on time or late.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The train might be on time or late\" from the statement \"The train might be late.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
