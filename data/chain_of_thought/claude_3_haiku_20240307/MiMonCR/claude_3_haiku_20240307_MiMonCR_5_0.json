This means that for the original statement to be true, both clauses must be true.\n\nNow, the question is whether we can infer the second clause 'The experiment might yield groundbreaking results' from the original statement. Since the original statement is a conjunction, we can infer the second clause because it is one of the conjuncts.\n\nAnswer: yes"
