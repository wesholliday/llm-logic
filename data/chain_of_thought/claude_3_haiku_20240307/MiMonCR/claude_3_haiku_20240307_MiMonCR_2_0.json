            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The recipe might require exotic ingredients' from the given statement 'The recipe might be complicated and require exotic ingredients', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe given statement is a compound statement that consists of two parts:\n1. The recipe might be complicated\n2. The recipe might require exotic ingredients\n\nThe key word here is 'and', which indicates that both parts of the statement are true. In other words, the recipe might be both complicated and require exotic ingredients.\n\nSince the second part of the statement, 'The recipe might require exotic ingredients', is already present in the given statement, we can infer that this statement is true. The fact that the recipe might be complicated does not negate the possibility that it might require exotic ingredients.\n\nAnswer: yes"
