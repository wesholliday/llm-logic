    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it\u2019s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn\u2019t get the offer, then if Priya doesn\u2019t, Diego will. Moreover, it\u2019s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn\u2019t get the offer, Diego will?",

Priya is the most likely to be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot.\n2. If Priya doesn't get the offer, then Julian will get it. If Priya doesn't get the offer and Julian doesn't either, then Diego will get it.\n3. It's likely that Priya will get the offer, and hence Julian likely won't.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where Priya doesn't get the offer. In this case, the next most likely candidate is Julian. However, since it's likely that Priya will get the offer, it follows that Julian is unlikely to get the offer.\n\nTherefore, if Priya doesn't get the offer, and Julian also doesn't get the offer, then Diego, being the longshot candidate, is likely to get the offer.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
