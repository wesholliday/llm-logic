    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don\u2019t increase the most, then if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won\u2019t increase the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

            "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are all expected to increase this year.\n2) Economists project that rents will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less.\n3) The question states that if home prices don't increase the most, and rents don't increase the most, then mortgage rates will increase the most.\n4) The question then asks if it follows that if rents don't increase the most, then mortgage rates will increase the most.\n5) The key here is the relationship between the three factors. If rents don't increase the most, then either home prices or mortgage rates must increase the most.\n6) The question states that rents likely will increase the most, so if that doesn't happen, then home prices likely won't increase the most either.\n7) Therefore, if rents don't increase the most, it follows that mortgage rates will increase the most.\n\nAnswer: yes"
