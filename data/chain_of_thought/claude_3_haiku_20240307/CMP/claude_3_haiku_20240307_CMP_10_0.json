    "user_prompt": "Suppose that spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons. Forecasts show it's likely most vacations this year will happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with many fewer happening in the winter. These are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. Moreover, spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will?",

Make sure not to answer with 'Answer:' until *after* you think step by step and explain your reasoning.",

            "content": "Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:\n\n1) The question states that spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons.\n2) Forecasts show that most vacations this year will happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with many fewer happening in the winter.\n3) The question states that these are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will.\n4) The question also states that spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't.\n5) The question is asking whether it follows that if spring doesn't have the most vacations, then winter will.\n\nGiven the information provided, it does seem to follow that if spring doesn't have the most vacations, then winter will. This is because the question states that if summer doesn't have the most vacations, and spring doesn't, then winter will. And the question also states that spring is likely to have the most travelers, so if it doesn't, then winter is the only remaining option.\n\nAnswer: yes"
