    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",

Make sure not to answer with 'Answer:' until *after* you think step by step and explain your reasoning.",

            "content": "Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:\n\n1. The premise states that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages.\n2. It also states that market research indicates coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings.\n3. The premise then states that these are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n4. Additionally, the premise states that coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers.\n5. The question is asking whether it follows that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n6. Given the information provided, this does seem to follow logically. If coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, and tea also doesn't retain the most morning drinkers (as stated in the premise), then the only remaining option is that soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nAnswer: yes"
