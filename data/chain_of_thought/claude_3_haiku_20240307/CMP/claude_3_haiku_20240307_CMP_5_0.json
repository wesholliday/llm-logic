    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians are the leading political parties. Based on recent polling, the Democrats likely will gain the most new voters, followed by Republicans, with Libertarians trailing distantly. These are the only major parties, so if Republicans don\u2019t gain the most voters, then if Democrats don\u2019t, Libertarians will. Moreover, Democrats likely will gain the most voters and hence Republicans likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will?",

            "content": "Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:\n\n1) The question states that the Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians are the leading political parties.\n2) Recent polling indicates that the Democrats are likely to gain the most new voters, followed by the Republicans, with the Libertarians trailing distantly.\n3) The question also states that these are the only major parties, so if the Republicans don't gain the most voters, then if the Democrats don't, the Libertarians will.\n4) Additionally, the question states that the Democrats are likely to gain the most voters, and hence the Republicans likely won't.\n5) The question then asks whether it follows that if the Democrats don't gain the most voters, the Libertarians will.\n\nReasoning:\nGiven the information provided, we can conclude that if the Democrats don't gain the most voters, then the Republicans must have gained the most. This is because the question states that these are the only major parties, so if the Democrats don't gain the most, then the Republicans or the Libertarians must.\nHowever, the question also states that the Democrats are likely to gain the most voters, and hence the Republicans likely won't. This means that if the Democrats don't gain the most voters, it is unlikely that the Republicans will either.\nTherefore, if the Democrats don't gain the most voters, it is likely that the Libertarians will.\n\nAnswer: yes"
