    "user_prompt": "Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it\u2019s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn\u2019t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn\u2019t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?",

            "content": "Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:\n\n1) The question states that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources.\n2) It also states that forecasts indicate tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind.\n3) The question then states that these are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn't generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn't, wind power will.\n4) Additionally, the question states that tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't.\n5) The final part of the question asks whether it follows that if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will.\n\nReasoning:\n- If tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, and solar power also doesn't, then the only remaining option is that wind power will generate the most electricity.\n- This is because the question states that these are the only major sources, and if the first two don't generate the most, then the third one must.\n\nAnswer: yes"
