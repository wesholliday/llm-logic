    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the stock market, real estate market, and bond market are the primary investment vehicles. According to financial advisors, the stock market likely will see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns. These markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn\u2019t have the highest returns, then if stocks don\u2019t, bonds will. Moreover, stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if stocks don\u2019t have the highest returns, bonds will?",

            "content": "Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:\n\n1) The question states that according to financial advisors, the stock market likely will see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns.\n\n2) It also states that these markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn't have the highest returns, then if stocks don't, bonds will.\n\n3) Additionally, it states that stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won't.\n\n4) The question then asks if it follows that it's likely that, if stocks don't have the highest returns, bonds will.\n\nTo answer this, we need to consider the information provided:\n- Stocks are expected to have the highest returns\n- If stocks don't have the highest returns, then real estate won't either\n- If stocks and real estate don't have the highest returns, then bonds will\n\nTherefore, if stocks don't have the highest returns, it is likely that bonds will.\n\nAnswer: yes"
