We are given the statement: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\"\n2. We are also given the statement: \"The fribble was snurgled.\"\n3. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and Q is \"the fribble crinked.\"\n4. The second statement tells us that P is true, i.e., \"the fribble was snurgled.\"\n5.
