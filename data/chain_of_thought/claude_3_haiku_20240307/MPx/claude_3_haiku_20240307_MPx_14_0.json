We are given the statement: \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\"\n2. We are also given the statement: \"The clug was fleeked.\"\n3. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the clug was fleeked) is true, then the consequent (the clug snugged) is also true.\n4. Since we are given that the antecedent (the clug was fleeked) is true, we can apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that 'The clug snugged' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
