We are also given the statement: \"The dreb was vroombed.\"\n3. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the dreb was vroombed) is true, then the second part (the dreb was spened) must also be true.\n4. Since we are told that \"The dreb was vroombed\" is true, we can infer that the second part of the conditional statement, \"the dreb was spened,\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
