The first premise is 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition 'the smip was shripped' is true, then the conclusion 'the smip lupped the zoint' must also be true.\n\n2. The second premise is 'The smip was shripped'. This means that the condition in the first premise is true.\n\n3.

Since we are given that P is true (i.e., \"The smip was shripped\"), we can apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if \"If P, then Q\" is true and P is true, then Q must also be true.\n5.
