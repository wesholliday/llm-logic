We are given the statement: \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\"\n2. We are also given the statement: \"The flugel was blimmed.\"\n3. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition \"the flugel was blimmed\" is true, then the conclusion \"the flugel was zargled\" is also true.\n4. Since we are given that \"The flugel was blimmed\" is true, we can apply the conditional statement and infer that \"The flugel was zargled\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
