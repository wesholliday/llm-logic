We are given the statement \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint\".\n2. We are also given the statement \"The wug was flooped\".\n3. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition \"the wug was flooped\" is true, then the conclusion \"the wug bimmed the zoint\" is also true.\n4. Since we are given that the condition \"the wug was flooped\" is true, we can apply the rule of modus ponens to infer that the conclusion \"the wug bimmed the zoint\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
