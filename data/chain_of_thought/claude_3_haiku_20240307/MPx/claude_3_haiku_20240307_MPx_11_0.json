We are given the statement: \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\"\n2. We are also given the statement: \"The flug was blummed.\"\n3. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition \"the flug was blummed\" is true, then the conclusion \"the flug was zimmed\" is also true.\n4. Since we are given that \"The flug was blummed\" is true, we can apply the conditional statement and infer that \"The flug was zimmed\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
