We are given the statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\"\n2. We are also given the statement \"The wug was sproinged.\"\n3. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the wug was sproinged) is true, then the consequent (it was garpled) must also be true.\n4. Since we know that the antecedent (the wug was sproinged) is true, we can infer that the consequent (it was garpled) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
