The first premise is 'If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the twonk was plinked, then it was also varnished.\n\n2. The second premise is 'The twonk was plinked'. This means that the condition in the first premise is true, i.e., the twonk was plinked.\n\n3. Since the condition in the first premise is true (the twonk was plinked), and the first premise states that if the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished, we can logically infer that 'It was varnished'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
