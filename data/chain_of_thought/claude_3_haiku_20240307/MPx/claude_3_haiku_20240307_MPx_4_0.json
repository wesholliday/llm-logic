We are given the statement: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\"\n2. We are also given the statement: \"The fribble was snurgled.\"\n3. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition \"the fribble was snurgled\" is true, then the conclusion \"the fribble crinked\" is also true.\n4. Since we are given that \"The fribble was snurgled\" is true, we can apply the conditional statement and infer that \"The fribble crinked\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
