We are given the statement 'If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'The whiffle was shanked'.\n3. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition 'the whiffle was shanked' is true, then the conclusion 'the whiffle tinked' is also true.\n4. Since we are given that 'The whiffle was shanked' is true, we can apply the conditional statement and infer that 'The whiffle tinked' is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
