We are given the statement: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\"\n2. We are also given the statement: \"The sprocket was cranked.\"\n3. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the sprocket was cranked) is true, then the consequent (the sprocket was daggled) is also true.\n4. Since we know that the antecedent (the sprocket was cranked) is true, we can infer that the consequent (the sprocket was daggled) is also true.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that 'The sprocket was daggled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
