We are given the statement: \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\"\n2. We are also given the statement: \"The sneg was crampled.\"\n3. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition \"the sneg was crampled\" is true, then the conclusion \"the sneg sproted the frink\" is also true.\n4. Since we are given that \"The sneg was crampled\" is true, we can apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if the condition of a conditional statement is true, then the conclusion is also true.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that \"The sneg sproted the frink\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
