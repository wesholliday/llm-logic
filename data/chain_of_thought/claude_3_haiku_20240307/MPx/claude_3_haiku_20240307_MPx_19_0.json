We are given the statement: \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\"\n2. We are also given the statement: \"The smonk was vreebled.\"\n3. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the smonk was vreebled) is true, then the consequent (the smonk plagged) is also true.\n4. Since we are given that the antecedent (the smonk was vreebled) is true, we can apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent is also true.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that 'The smonk plagged' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
