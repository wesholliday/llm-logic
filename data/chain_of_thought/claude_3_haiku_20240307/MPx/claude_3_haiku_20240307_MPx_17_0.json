We are given the statement \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\".\n2. We are also given the statement \"The flob was skizzled\".\n3. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition \"the flob was skizzled\" is true, then the conclusion \"the flob movated\" is also true.\n4. Since we are given that the condition \"the flob was skizzled\" is true, we can apply the conditional statement to infer that the conclusion \"the flob movated\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
