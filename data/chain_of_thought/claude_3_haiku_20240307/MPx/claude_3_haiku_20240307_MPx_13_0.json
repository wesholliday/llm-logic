We are given the statement: \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\"\n2. We are also given the statement: \"The glip was slogged.\"\n3. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the glip was slogged) is true, then the consequent (the glip was tragged) must also be true.\n4. Since we are given that the antecedent (the glip was slogged) is true, we can infer that the consequent (the glip was tragged) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
