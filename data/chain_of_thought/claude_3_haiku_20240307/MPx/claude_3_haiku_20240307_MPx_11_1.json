The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed'. This means that if the flug was blummed, then it necessarily follows that the flug was zimmed.\n\n2. The second statement is a categorical statement: 'The flug was blummed'. This means that the flug was indeed blummed.\n\n3. Since the first statement is a conditional and the second statement affirms the antecedent (the flug was blummed), we can apply the rule of modus ponens to infer the consequent, which is 'The flug was zimmed'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
