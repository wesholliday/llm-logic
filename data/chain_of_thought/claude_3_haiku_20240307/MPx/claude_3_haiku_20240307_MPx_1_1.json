We are given the premises:\n   - \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\"\n   - \"The flugel was blimmed.\"\n\n2. The first premise is a conditional statement, which can be written as: \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the flugel was blimmed\" and Q is \"the flugel was zargled\".\n\n3. The second premise, \"The flugel was blimmed,\" is the same as P.\n\n4. Using the rules of logical inference, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, then we can infer that Q is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
