We are given the statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\"\n2. We are also given the statement \"The fleeg was bluttered.\"\n3. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition \"the fleeg was bluttered\" is true, then the conclusion \"it surned\" is also true.\n4. Since we know that \"The fleeg was bluttered\" is true, we can apply the conditional statement and infer that \"The fleeg surned\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
