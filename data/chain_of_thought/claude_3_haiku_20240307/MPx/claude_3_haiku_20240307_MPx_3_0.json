We are given the statement: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\"\n2. We are also given the statement: \"The splat was morphed.\"\n3. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the splat was morphed) is true, then the consequent (the splat quanked) is also true.\n4. Since we are given that the antecedent (the splat was morphed) is true, we can apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent is also true.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that 'The splat quanked' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
