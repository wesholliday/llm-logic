'The fleeg might not be surned'\n2. 'Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned'\n\nStep 1: Understand the logical connections between the given statements.\n- The first statement, 'The fleeg might not be surned', suggests that it is possible for the fleeg not to be surned.\n- The second statement, 'Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned', implies that the fleeg can either be bluttered or surned, but not both.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the possible scenarios based on the given information.\n- If the fleeg is not surned (as suggested by the first statement), then it must be bluttered according to the second statement.\n- If the fleeg is not bluttered, then it must be surned according to the second statement.\n\nStep 3: Determine the inference.\nGiven the information provided, we can infer that 'The fleeg is bluttered'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
