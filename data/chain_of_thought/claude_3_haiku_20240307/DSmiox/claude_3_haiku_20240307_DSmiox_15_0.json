The first statement is 'The dreb might not be spened'.\n2. The second statement is 'Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened'.\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that if the dreb is not spened, then it must be vroombed.\n4. Since the first statement says 'The dreb might not be spened', we can infer that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
