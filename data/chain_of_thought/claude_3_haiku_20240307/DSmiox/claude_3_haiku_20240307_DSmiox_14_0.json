The first statement is 'The clug might not be snugged'. This means that it is possible that the clug is not snugged.\n\n2. The second statement is 'Either the clug is fleeked or it must be snugged'. This means that the clug must either be fleeked or snugged, but not both.\n\n3. Since the first statement suggests that the clug might not be snugged, and the second statement says that the clug must either be fleeked or snugged, we can infer that the clug must be fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
