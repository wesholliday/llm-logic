We are given the premises: 'The grommet might not be plopped' and 'Either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped'.\n\n2. From the second premise, we can infer that if the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed.\n\n3. The first premise states that the grommet 'might not be plopped'. This means that it is possible for the grommet to not be plopped.\n\n4. Combining the implications from the two premises, if the grommet might not be plopped, and if it's not plopped then it must be sploffed, we can conclude that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
