We are given the statement 'The smonk might not be plagged'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged'.\n3. From the first statement, we know that it is possible that the smonk is not plagged.\n4. From the second statement, we know that if the smonk is not plagged, then it must be vreebled.\n5. Therefore, if the smonk might not be plagged, then it must be vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
