The first premise is 'The splat might not be quanked'.\n2. The second premise is 'Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked'.\n3. From the first premise, we can infer that it is possible that the splat is not quanked.\n4. From the second premise, we can infer that if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed.\n5. Therefore, if the splat might not be quanked, then it must be morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
