The first premise is 'The whiffle might not be tinked'.\n2. The second premise is 'Either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked'.\n3. From the second premise, we can infer that if the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be shanked.\n4. Since the first premise states that the whiffle might not be tinked, we can infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
