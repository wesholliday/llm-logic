The first premise is 'The zinger might not be smoogled'.\n2. The second premise is 'Either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled'.\n3. From the second premise, we can infer that if the zinger is not smoogled, then it must be fraggled.\n4. Since the first premise states that the zinger might not be smoogled, we can infer that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
