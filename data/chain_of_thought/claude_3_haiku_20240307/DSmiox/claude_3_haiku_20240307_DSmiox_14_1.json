We are also given the premise: \"Either the clug is fleeked or it must be snugged\".\n3. The question is whether we can infer from these premises that \"The clug is fleeked\".\n4. Looking at the second premise, it states that either the clug is fleeked or it must be snugged. This means that if the clug is not snugged, then it must be fleeked.\n5. Going back to the first premise, it states that \"The clug might not be snugged\". This means that it is possible that the clug is not snugged.\n6. Combining the first and second premises, we can conclude that if the clug is not snugged, then it must be fleeked.\n7.
