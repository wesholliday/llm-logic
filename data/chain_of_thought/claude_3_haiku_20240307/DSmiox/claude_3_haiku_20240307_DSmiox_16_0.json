The first statement is 'The sneg might not be sproted'. This means that it is possible that the sneg is not sproted.\n\n2. The second statement is 'Either the sneg is crampled or it must be sproted'. This means that the sneg is either crampled or sproted, but not both.\n\n3. Since the first statement says the sneg might not be sproted, and the second statement says the sneg is either crampled or sproted, we can infer that the sneg must be crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
