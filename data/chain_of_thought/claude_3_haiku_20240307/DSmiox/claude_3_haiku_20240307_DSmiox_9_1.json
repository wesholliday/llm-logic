This statement suggests that the twonk may or may not be plinked.\n\nThe second premise is 'Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked'. This statement presents two mutually exclusive possibilities: either the twonk is varnished, or it must be plinked.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical inference we can draw from these premises.\n\nIf the twonk might not be plinked, and the twonk must either be varnished or plinked, then we can conclude that the twonk must be varnished.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that 'The twonk is varnished'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
