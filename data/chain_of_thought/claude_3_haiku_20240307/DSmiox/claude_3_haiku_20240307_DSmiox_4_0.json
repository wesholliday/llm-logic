We are given the statement 'The fribble might not be crinked'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked'.\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that the fribble might not be crinked.\n4. From the second statement, we can infer that if the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled.\n5. Therefore, if the fribble might not be crinked, then it must be snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
