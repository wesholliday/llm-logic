We are given the statements:\n   - 'The smip might not be lupped'\n   - 'Either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped'\n\n2. From the second statement, we can infer that if the smip is not lupped, then it must be shripped.\n3. The first statement tells us that the smip 'might not be lupped', which means it is possible that the smip is not lupped.\n4. Therefore, if the smip is not lupped, and it must be either shripped or lupped, then we can infer that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes"
