The first premise is 'The flugel might not be zargled'.\n2. The second premise is 'Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled'.\n3. From the second premise, we can infer that if the flugel is not zargled, then it must be blimmed.\n4. Since the first premise states that the flugel might not be zargled, we can infer that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
