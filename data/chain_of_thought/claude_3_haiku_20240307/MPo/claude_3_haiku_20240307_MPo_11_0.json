We are given the statement 'The cake was chocolate'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the cake was chocolate) is true, then the consequent (the muffins were blueberry) is also true.\n4. Since the antecedent 'the cake was chocolate' is true, we can apply the rule of modus ponens to infer that the consequent 'the muffins were blueberry' is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
