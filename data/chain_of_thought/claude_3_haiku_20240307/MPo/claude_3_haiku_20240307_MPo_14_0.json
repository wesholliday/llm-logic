The first premise is 'The bear was in the cave'.\n2. The second premise is 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den'.\n3. The second premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the bear was in the cave) is true, then the consequent (the wolf was in the den) must also be true.\n4. Since the first premise states that 'The bear was in the cave', we can apply the conditional statement from the second premise.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that 'The wolf was in the den'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
