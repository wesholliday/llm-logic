This is a simple categorical statement that provides information about the color of the car.\n\nThe second statement is 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the car was red) is true, then the consequent (the truck was blue) must also be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical inference:\n- We are given that 'The car was red' is true.\n- Since the conditional statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' is also true, we can infer that the consequent 'The truck was blue' must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that 'The truck was blue'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
