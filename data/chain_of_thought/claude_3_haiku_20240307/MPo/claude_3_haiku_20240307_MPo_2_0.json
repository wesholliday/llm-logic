            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'The unicorn was in the forest' from the given premises, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first premise is 'The griffin was in the forest'. This is a simple categorical statement that directly states the location of the griffin.\n\nThe second premise is 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the griffin was in the forest) is true, then the consequent (the unicorn was in the forest) is also true.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical inference we can make from these two premises.\n\nThe first premise tells us that the antecedent of the conditional statement is true ('the griffin was in the forest'). Therefore, we can apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if the antecedent of a conditional statement is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the consequent of the conditional statement is 'the unicorn was in the forest'. Therefore, we can infer that 'The unicorn was in the forest'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
