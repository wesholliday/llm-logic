            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'Jen watched basketball' from the given information, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements.\n\nThe first statement, 'Tom watched football', is a simple declarative statement.\n\nThe second statement, 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball', is a conditional statement. It states that if the antecedent (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequent (Jen watched basketball) is also true.\n\nTo infer the consequent (Jen watched basketball) from the given information, we need to have the antecedent (Tom watched football) as true.\n\nSince the first statement, 'Tom watched football', is given as true, we can apply the conditional statement and infer that the consequent, 'Jen watched basketball', is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
