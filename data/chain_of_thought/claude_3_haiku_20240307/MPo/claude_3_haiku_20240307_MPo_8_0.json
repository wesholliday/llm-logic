The first premise is 'The vampire was awake'.\n2. The second premise is 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake'.\n3. The second premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the vampire was awake) is true, then the second part (the mummy was awake) must also be true.\n4. Since the first premise states that 'The vampire was awake', and the second premise tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake, we can conclude that 'The mummy was awake'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
