We are given the statement 'Sam took a plane'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Sam took a plane) is true, then the consequent (Erin took a train) must also be true.\n4. Since we know that the antecedent 'Sam took a plane' is true, we can apply the rule of modus ponens to infer that the consequent 'Erin took a train' is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
