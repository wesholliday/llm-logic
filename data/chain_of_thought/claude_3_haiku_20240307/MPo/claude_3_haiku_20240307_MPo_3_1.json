This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the book was written by James' and Q is 'the book is a mystery novel'.\n\nTo draw a valid inference from these premises, we need to use the rule of modus ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' and the antecedent 'P' is true, then we can infer the consequent 'Q'.\n\nIn this case, we have the conditional statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel', and the antecedent 'The book was written by James' is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The book is a mystery novel' using the rule of modus ponens.\n\nAnswer: yes"
