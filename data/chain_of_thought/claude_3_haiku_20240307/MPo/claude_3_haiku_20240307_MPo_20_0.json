            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'The banana was yellow' from the given information, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement, 'The apple was red', is a simple categorical statement.\n\nThe second statement, 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow', is a conditional statement. It states that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nTo infer 'The banana was yellow' from these two statements, we need to apply the rules of logical inference, specifically the rule of modus ponens.\n\nThe rule of modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (if P, then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then we can infer the consequent (Q).\n\nIn this case, the first statement, 'The apple was red', provides the antecedent (P) for the conditional statement. Therefore, we can apply the rule of modus ponens to infer the consequent, 'The banana was yellow'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
