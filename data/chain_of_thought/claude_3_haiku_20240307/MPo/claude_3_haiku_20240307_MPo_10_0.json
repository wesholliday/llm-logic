We also have the statement 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the dog was inside) is true, then the consequent (the cat was outside) must also be true.\n4. Since the first statement 'The dog was inside' is true, we can apply the conditional statement and infer that 'The cat was outside' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
