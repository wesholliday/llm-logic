We are given the statement \"Lisa bought the red shirt\".\n2. We are also given the statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\".\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the consequent (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true.\n4. Since we know that the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, we can apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if the antecedent of a conditional statement is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that \"Mark bought the blue shirt\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
