Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (if P, then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then we can infer the consequent (Q).\n\nIn this case, the first premise, \"The griffin was in the forest,\" satisfies the antecedent of the conditional statement, \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" Therefore, we can infer the consequent, \"The unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
