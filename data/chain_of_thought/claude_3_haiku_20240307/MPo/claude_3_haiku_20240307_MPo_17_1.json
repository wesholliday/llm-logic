'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad' - This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition 'Ben ate pasta' is true, then the consequence 'Kate ate the salad' is also true.\n\nSince the first statement 'Ben ate pasta' is true, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that the consequence 'Kate ate the salad' is also true.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that 'Kate ate the salad'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
