This is a simple factual statement.\n\nThe second statement is \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\". This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition \"Sue chose pizza\" is true, then the conclusion \"Bob chose pasta\" must also be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n1. If we know that \"Sue chose pizza\" is true, then the conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" allows us to infer that \"Bob chose pasta\" is also true.\n\n2. However, the given information only states that \"Sue chose pizza\", and does not provide any information about whether the conditional statement is true or false.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"Bob chose pasta\" is true. The conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is not enough to conclude that \"Bob chose pasta\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
