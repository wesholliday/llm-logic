The second statement is 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the consequent (Kate ate the salad) must also be true.\n4. Since the first statement 'Ben ate pasta' is true, we can apply the conditional statement and conclude that the consequent 'Kate ate the salad' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
