We are given two premises:\n   - \"Mary was at the wedding\"\n   - \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\"\n\n2. The second premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequent (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true.\n\n3. Since the first premise, \"Mary was at the wedding\", is true, we can apply the conditional statement and infer that the consequent, \"Sue was at the wedding\", must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
