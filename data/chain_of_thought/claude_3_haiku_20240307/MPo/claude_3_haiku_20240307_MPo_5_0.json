This is a simple declarative statement.\n\nThe second statement is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the antecedent) is true, then the second part (the consequent) is also true.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical reasoning:\n1. We are given that 'Jeff played basketball' is true.\n2. Since the conditional statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis' is also true, we can infer that the consequent 'Amy played tennis' is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'Amy played tennis'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
