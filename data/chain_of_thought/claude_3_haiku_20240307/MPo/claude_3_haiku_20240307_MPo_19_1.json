It states that if the condition 'Tom watched football' is true, then the conclusion 'Jen watched basketball' must also be true.\n\nTo infer 'Jen watched basketball' from these premises, we need to apply the rules of logical reasoning, specifically the rule of modus ponens.\n\nModus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement of the form 'If P, then Q' and we also have the premise 'P' (the antecedent), then we can logically conclude 'Q' (the consequent).\n\nIn this case, we have the conditional statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball', and we also have the premise 'Tom watched football'.
