'The dog was inside'\n2. 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside'\n\nThe question is asking if we can infer 'The cat was outside' from these two statements.\n\nTo answer this, we can use the rule of modus ponens, which states that if we have 'If p, then q' and 'p', then we can infer 'q'.\n\nIn this case, we have 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' (the first statement) and 'The dog was inside' (the second statement).

This is a conditional statement, which means it establishes a relationship between the dog being inside and the cat being outside.\n\nTo infer 'The cat was outside', we need to apply the modus ponens rule of logical inference. This rule states that if we have a conditional statement (if P, then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then we can infer the consequent (Q) is also true.\n\nIn this case, the first premise 'The dog was inside' corresponds to the antecedent (P) of the conditional statement, and the second premise 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' corresponds to the conditional statement (if P, then Q).\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The cat was outside' based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
