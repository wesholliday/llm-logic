We are given the statement 'Joe went to the park'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Joe went to the park) is true, then the consequent (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true.\n4. Since we know that the antecedent 'Joe went to the park' is true, we can infer that the consequent 'Lucy went to the zoo' is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
