It states that if the antecedent (Alex finished the race) is true, then the consequent (Chris finished the race) is also true.\n\nTo infer the conclusion 'Chris finished the race', we need to apply the rules of logical inference. Specifically, we can use the rule of modus ponens, which states that if the antecedent of a conditional statement is true, then the consequent is also true.\n\nGiven the information 'Alex finished the race' and 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race', we can apply modus ponens to infer that 'Chris finished the race'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
