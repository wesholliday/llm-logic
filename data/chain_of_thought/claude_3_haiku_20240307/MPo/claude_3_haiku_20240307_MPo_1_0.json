We are given the statement 'Mary was at the wedding'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequent (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true.\n4. Since we know that the antecedent 'Mary was at the wedding' is true, we can apply the rule of modus ponens to infer that the consequent 'Sue was at the wedding' is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
