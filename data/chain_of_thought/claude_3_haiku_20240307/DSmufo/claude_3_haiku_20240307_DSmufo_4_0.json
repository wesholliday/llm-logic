The first premise is \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.\" This means that it is not necessary for the cat to be playing in the bedroom.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either the cat must be playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch.\" This means that the cat must be either playing in the bedroom or napping on the couch, but not both.\n\n3. Now, if the cat is not necessarily playing in the bedroom (from the first premise), and it must be either playing in the bedroom or napping on the couch (from the second premise), then the only remaining possibility is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes"
