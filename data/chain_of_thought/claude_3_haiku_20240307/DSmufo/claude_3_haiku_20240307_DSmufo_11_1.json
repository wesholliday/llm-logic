We are given two premises:\n   a) \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch\"\n   b) \"Either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway\"\n\n2. From premise (a), we can infer that the newspaper is not necessarily on the porch.\n\n3. From premise (b), we can infer that the newspaper is either on the porch or in the driveway. This is because the premise states that it is either one or the other, with no third option.\n\n4.
