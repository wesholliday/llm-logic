The first premise is \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\" This means that the sunglasses are not necessarily on her head.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag.\" This means that the sunglasses are either on her head or in her bag, and there are no other possibilities.\n\n3. From the first premise, we know that the sunglasses are not necessarily on her head. \n\n4. Since the second premise states that the sunglasses are either on her head or in her bag, and the first premise tells us they are not on her head, the only remaining possibility is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
