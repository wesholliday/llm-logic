The first statement is \"It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen.\" This means that the phone is not necessarily ringing in the kitchen.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the phone must be ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room.\" This means that the phone is either ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room.\n\n3. Since the first statement tells us that the phone is not necessarily ringing in the kitchen, the only other possibility is that the phone is in the living room.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes"
