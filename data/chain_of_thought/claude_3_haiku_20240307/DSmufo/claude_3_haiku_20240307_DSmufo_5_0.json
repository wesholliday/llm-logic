The first premise is \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\" This means that the cookies are not necessarily in the pantry.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar.\" This means that the cookies are either in the pantry or in the jar, but not both.\n\n3. Since the first premise tells us that the cookies are not necessarily in the pantry, the only other option is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes"
