The first premise is \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\" This means that it is not necessary for the pen to be on the desk.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag.\" This means that the pen must either be on the desk or in the bag, but not both.\n\n3. From the first premise, we know that the pen is not necessarily on the desk. This means that the only other possibility is that the pen is in the bag.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
