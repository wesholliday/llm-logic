The first statement is \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\" This means that the toy is not required to be on the bookshelf.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box.\" This means that the toy must either be on the bookshelf or in the toy box, but not both.\n\n3. Combining the two statements, we can infer that if the toy is not required to be on the bookshelf, and it must be either on the bookshelf or in the toy box, then the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
