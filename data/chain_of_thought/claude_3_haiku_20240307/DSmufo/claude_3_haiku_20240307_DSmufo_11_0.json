The first premise is \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch.\" This means that it is not necessary for the newspaper to be on the porch.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway.\" This means that the newspaper must either be on the porch or in the driveway, but not both.\n\n3. From the first premise, we know that the newspaper is not necessarily on the porch. This means that the only other possibility is that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes"
