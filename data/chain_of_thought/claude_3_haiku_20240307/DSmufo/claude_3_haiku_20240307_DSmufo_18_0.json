The first statement is \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\" This means that the notebook is not necessarily on the nightstand.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer.\" This means that the notebook is either on the nightstand or in the drawer, but not both.\n\n3. Given the first statement, we can infer that the notebook is not on the nightstand. Therefore, the only other possibility is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
