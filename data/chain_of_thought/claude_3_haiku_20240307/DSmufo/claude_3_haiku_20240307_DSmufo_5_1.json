The first statement is \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\" This means that the cookies are not necessarily hidden in the pantry.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar.\" This means that the cookies are either in the pantry or in the jar, but not both.\n\n3. Given these two statements, if the cookies are not in the pantry (as per the first statement), then they must be in the jar (as per the second statement).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes"
