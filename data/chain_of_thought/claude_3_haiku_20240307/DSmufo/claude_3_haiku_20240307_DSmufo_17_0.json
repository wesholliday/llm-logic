The first premise is \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\" This means that the scarf does not have to be draped on the coat rack.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack.\" This means that the scarf is either draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in the backpack.\n\n3. Since the first premise tells us that the scarf does not have to be draped on the coat rack, the only other possibility is that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes"
