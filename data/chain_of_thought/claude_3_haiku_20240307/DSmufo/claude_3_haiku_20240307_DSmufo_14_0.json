This means that it is not necessary for the milk to be in the fridge.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter\". This means that the milk must either be in the fridge or on the counter, but not both.\n\n3. Given the first premise, we can infer that the milk is not in the fridge. This leaves us with the conclusion that the milk must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes"
