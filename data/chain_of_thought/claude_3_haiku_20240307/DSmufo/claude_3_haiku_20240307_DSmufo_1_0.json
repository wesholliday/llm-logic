This means that it is not necessary for Fido to be in the garden.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside\". This means that Fido must either be in the garden or inside, but not both.\n\n3. Since it is not necessary for Fido to be in the garden (from the first premise), the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
