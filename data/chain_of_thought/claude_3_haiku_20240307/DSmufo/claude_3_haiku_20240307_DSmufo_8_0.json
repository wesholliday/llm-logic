The first premise is \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\" This means that the remote control is not necessarily under the couch.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table.\" This means that the remote control is either under the couch or on the coffee table, and one of these two options must be true.\n\n3. Given the first premise, we can conclude that the remote control is not under the couch. This leaves us with the only remaining option from the second premise, which is that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
