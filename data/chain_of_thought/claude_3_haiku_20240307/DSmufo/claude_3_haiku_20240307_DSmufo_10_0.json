The first premise is \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\" This means that the missing sock is not necessarily under the bed.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either the missing sock must be under the bed or it's in the laundry basket.\" This means that the missing sock must be either under the bed or in the laundry basket.\n\n3. Now, we need to consider the two possibilities:\n   a) If the missing sock is not under the bed (from the first premise), then it must be in the laundry basket (from the second premise).\n   b) If the missing sock is not in the laundry basket, then it must be under the bed (from the second premise).\n\n4. Therefore, from the given premises, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes"
