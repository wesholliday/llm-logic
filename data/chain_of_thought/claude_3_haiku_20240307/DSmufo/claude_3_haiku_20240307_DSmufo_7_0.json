The first premise is \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\" This means that it is not necessary for the umbrella to be in the closet.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car.\" This means that the umbrella must either be in the closet or in the car.\n\n3. Since the first premise tells us that the umbrella is not necessarily in the closet, the only other option is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes"
