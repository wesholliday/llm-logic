The first statement is \"It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door.\" This means that the shoes are not required to be lined up by the door.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the shoes must be lined up by the door or they are in the closet.\" This means that the shoes must either be lined up by the door or they must be in the closet. There are no other options.\n\n3. Since the first statement tells us that the shoes are not required to be lined up by the door, the only other option from the second statement is that the shoes must be in the closet.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes"
