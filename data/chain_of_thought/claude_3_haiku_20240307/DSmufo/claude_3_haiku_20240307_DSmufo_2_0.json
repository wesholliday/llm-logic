This means that it is not necessary for the book to be on the table.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf\". This means that the book must either be on the table or on the shelf, but not both.\n\n3. From the first premise, we know that the book is not necessarily on the table. And from the second premise, we know that the book must be either on the table or on the shelf.\n\n4. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes"
