This means that it is not necessary for the keys to be dangling in the cabinet.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer\". This means that the keys must either be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer. There are no other possibilities.\n\n3. Since the first premise tells us that the keys are not necessarily dangling in the cabinet, the only other possibility is that they are in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
