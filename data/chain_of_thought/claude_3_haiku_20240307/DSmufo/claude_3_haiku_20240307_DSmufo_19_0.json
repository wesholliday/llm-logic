The first premise is: \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\"\n   This means that the watch is not necessarily on his wrist.\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser.\"\n   This means that the watch must either be on his wrist or charging on the dresser. There are no other possibilities.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the two possibilities:\n   a) If the watch is not on his wrist (from the first premise), then it must be charging on the dresser (from the second premise).\n   b) If the watch is on his wrist, then it cannot be charging on the dresser (from the second premise).\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes"
