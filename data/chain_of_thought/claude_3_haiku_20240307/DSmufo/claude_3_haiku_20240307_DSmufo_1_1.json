This means that it is not necessary for Fido to be in the garden.\n\n2) The second statement is \"Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside\". This means that Fido must either be in the garden or inside, with no other possible location.\n\n3) Combining these two statements, we can infer that since it is not necessary for Fido to be in the garden, and he must either be in the garden or inside, the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"

This statement does not directly imply where Fido is, but rather, it suggests that Fido's location is not predetermined.\n\nThe second statement, \"Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside,\" presents two mutually exclusive possibilities: either Fido must be in the garden, or Fido is inside.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these two statements together:\n1. If it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden (first statement), then the second statement's first option (\"Fido must be in the garden\") is not true.\n2. Therefore, the remaining option in the second statement must be true, which is \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
