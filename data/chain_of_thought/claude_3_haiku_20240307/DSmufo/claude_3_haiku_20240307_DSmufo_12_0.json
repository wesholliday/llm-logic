The first premise is \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\" This means that it is not necessary for the jacket to be hanging in the closet.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair.\" This means that the jacket must be either hanging in the closet or draped over the chair.\n\n3. Since the first premise tells us that the jacket is not necessarily hanging in the closet, the only other possibility is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes"
