The converse of a conditional statement is a logically distinct statement that cannot be inferred from the original statement alone.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the whiffle tinked, then the whiffle was shanked' from the given statement 'If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked'.\n\nAnswer: no"
