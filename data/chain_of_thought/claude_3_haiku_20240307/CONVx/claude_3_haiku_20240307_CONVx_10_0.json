The converse of a conditional statement is a logically distinct statement, and it cannot be automatically inferred from the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the wug was garpled, then it was sproinged' from the given statement 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled'.\n\nAnswer: no"
