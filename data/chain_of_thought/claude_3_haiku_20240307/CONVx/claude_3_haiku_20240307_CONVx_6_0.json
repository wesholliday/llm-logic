The converse of a conditional statement is a logically distinct statement that may or may not be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was sploffed' from the given statement 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink'.\n\nAnswer: no"
