This means that if the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\n\nTo infer the statement \"If the fribble crinked, then the fribble was snurgled\", we need to consider the converse of the original statement. The converse is the statement in the form \"If B, then A\", where B is the same as before, and A is the opposite of the original statement.\n\nHowever, the converse of a conditional statement is not always true, even if the original statement is true. In other words, just because \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\" is true, it does not necessarily mean that \"If the fribble crinked, then the fribble was snurgled\" is also true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the fribble crinked, then the fribble was snurgled' from the given statement 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked'.\n\nAnswer: no"
