The validity of the converse depends on the logical relationship between the antecedent (A) and the consequent (B).\n\nIn this case, we cannot infer the converse statement \"If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was shripped\" from the given information. The fact that the smip lupped the zoint does not necessarily imply that the smip was shripped.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no"
