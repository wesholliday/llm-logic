The converse of a conditional statement is a logically distinct statement that does not necessarily follow from the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the clug snugged, then the clug was fleeked' from the given statement 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged'.\n\nAnswer: no"
