This statement does not necessarily imply the converse, which would be 'If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was vreebled'.\n\nThe converse of a conditional statement is not always true, even if the original statement is true. In other words, the fact that 'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged' is true does not guarantee that 'If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was vreebled' is also true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was vreebled' from the given statement 'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged'.\n\nAnswer: no"
