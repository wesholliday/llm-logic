The converse of 'If P, then Q' is 'If Q, then P'.\n\nHowever, the converse of a conditional statement is not always true, even if the original statement is true. The converse can only be inferred if the original statement is a biconditional statement, which is of the form 'If and only if P, then Q'.\n\nIn this case, the given statement is a simple conditional statement, not a biconditional statement. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the flob movated, then the flob was skizzled' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
