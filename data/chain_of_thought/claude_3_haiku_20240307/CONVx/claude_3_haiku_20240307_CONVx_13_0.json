The converse of a conditional statement is a logically distinct statement, and it cannot be automatically inferred from the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the glip was tragged, then the glip was slogged' from the given statement 'If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged'.\n\nAnswer: no"
