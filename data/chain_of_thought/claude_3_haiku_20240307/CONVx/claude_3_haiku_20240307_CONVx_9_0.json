The converse is only true if the original statement is a biconditional statement, which means that the two statements are logically equivalent.\n\nIn this case, the given statement is a simple conditional statement, not a biconditional statement. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the twonk was varnished, then it was plinked' from the given statement 'If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished'.\n\nAnswer: no"
