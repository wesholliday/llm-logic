This is known as the converse of the original statement.\n\nHowever, the converse of a conditional statement is not always logically valid. In other words, we cannot always infer the converse from the original statement.\n\nIn this case, the converse 'If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was vroombed' is not necessarily true, even if the original statement 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened' is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was vroombed' from the given statement 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened'.\n\nAnswer: no"
