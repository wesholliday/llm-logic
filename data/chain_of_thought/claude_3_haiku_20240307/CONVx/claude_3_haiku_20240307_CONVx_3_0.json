In other words, the statement 'If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed' does not necessarily follow from the given statement 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked'.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
