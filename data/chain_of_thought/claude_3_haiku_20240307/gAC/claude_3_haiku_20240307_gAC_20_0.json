            "content": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the given statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This means that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement: \"The banana was yellow.\" This statement is true.\n\nNow, the question is whether the third statement, \"The apple was red,\" follows from the first two statements.\n\nThe first statement tells us that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. The second statement tells us that the banana was yellow. However, this does not necessarily mean that the apple was red. The first statement does not provide any information about the color of the apple if the banana was yellow.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \"The apple was red\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
