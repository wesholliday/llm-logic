This means that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. However, the converse of this statement, \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate,\" is not necessarily true.\n\nThe second statement, \"The muffins were blueberry,\" is true.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n- If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry (first statement)\n- The muffins were blueberry (second statement)\n- However, the fact that the muffins were blueberry does not necessarily mean that the cake was chocolate.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that \"The cake was chocolate\" is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
