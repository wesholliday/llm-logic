We are given that the statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is true.\n2. We are also given that the statement \"Chris finished the race\" is true.\n3. The statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the antecedent (Alex finished the race) is true, then the consequent (Chris finished the race) must also be true.\n4. Since we know that the consequent (Chris finished the race) is true, we can infer that the antecedent (Alex finished the race) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"Alex finished the race\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
