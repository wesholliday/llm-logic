In other words, the vampire being awake is the sufficient condition for the mummy to be awake.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second given statement, \"The mummy was awake.\"\nThis statement tells us that the mummy was indeed awake.\n\nStep 3: Use the rules of logical reasoning to determine if \"The vampire was awake\" is true.\nSince we know that \"The mummy was awake\" is true, and the first statement tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake, we can conclude that the vampire must have been awake as well.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
