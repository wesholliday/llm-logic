This means that if the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the consequent (Kate ate salad) must also be true. However, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. Just because the consequent (Kate ate salad) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) is also true.\n\nThe second statement, \"Kate ate salad,\" is true. This means that the consequent of the first statement is true.\n\nHowever, the question is asking whether it follows that \"Ben ate pasta\" is true. Since the converse of the first statement is not necessarily true, the fact that \"Kate ate salad\" is true does not necessarily imply that \"Ben ate pasta\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: no"
