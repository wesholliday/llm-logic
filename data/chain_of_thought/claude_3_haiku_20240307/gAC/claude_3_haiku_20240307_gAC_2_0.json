We are given that the statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" is true.\n2. We are also given that the statement \"The unicorn was in the forest\" is true.\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. This means that the presence of the griffin in the forest implies the presence of the unicorn in the forest.\n4. Since we know that the unicorn was in the forest, we can use the first statement to conclude that the griffin must have also been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes"
