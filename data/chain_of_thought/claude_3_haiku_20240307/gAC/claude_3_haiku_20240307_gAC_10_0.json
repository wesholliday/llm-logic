The first statement, \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside,\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the cat was outside, then the dog was inside.\n2. The second statement, \"The cat was outside,\" is true. This means that the condition in the first statement is satisfied, as the cat was indeed outside.\n3. However, the first statement does not provide enough information to conclude that the dog was inside. It only states that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. It does not necessarily mean that the dog was inside.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it does not follow that \"The dog was inside\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
