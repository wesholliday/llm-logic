            "content": "Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:\n\n1) The first statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\". This is a conditional statement, which means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. It does not mean that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was there.\n\n2) The second statement is \"Sue was at the wedding\". This is a true statement.\n\n3) From the first statement, we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. Since we know that Sue was at the wedding, this means that the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that \"Mary was at the wedding\" follows from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
