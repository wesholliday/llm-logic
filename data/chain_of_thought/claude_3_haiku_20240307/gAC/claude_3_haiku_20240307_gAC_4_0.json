This means that if the antecedent (the alien visited Mars) is true, then the consequent (the robot visited Jupiter) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement, \"The robot visited Jupiter,\" is true. This means that the consequent of the first statement is true.\n\nNow, we can use the rule of modus ponens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is true, and the consequent (the robot visited Jupiter) is true. Therefore, we can conclude that the antecedent (the alien visited Mars) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
