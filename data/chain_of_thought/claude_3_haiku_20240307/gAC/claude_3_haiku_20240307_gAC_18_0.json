This means that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. However, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. Just because the truck was metal, it does not necessarily mean that the doll was plastic.\n\nThe second statement, \"The truck was metal,\" is true. This means that the antecedent of the first statement, \"the truck was metal,\" is true.\n\nHowever, the conclusion, \"The doll was plastic,\" does not necessarily follow from the given information. The first statement only tells us that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal, but it does not tell us anything about the actual state of the doll.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \"The doll was plastic\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
