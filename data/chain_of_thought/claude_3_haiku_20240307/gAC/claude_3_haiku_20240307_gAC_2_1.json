This is a conditional statement that says if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest.\n\n2) The second statement is \"The unicorn was in the forest\". This is a true statement.\n\n3) From the first statement, we know that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. And the second statement tells us that the unicorn was in the forest.\n\n4) Using the rules of logical reasoning, if the \"if\" part of the conditional statement is true (the unicorn was in the forest), then the \"then\" part must also be true (the griffin was in the forest).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
