This is because the conditional statement only tells us that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must be true, but it does not tell us that if the consequent is true, then the antecedent must also be true.\n\nIn other words, the truth of the consequent does not automatically imply the truth of the antecedent. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \"The book was written by James\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
