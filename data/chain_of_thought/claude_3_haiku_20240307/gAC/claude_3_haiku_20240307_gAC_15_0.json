We are also given that the statement \"Erin took a train\" is true.\n3. The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the antecedent (Sam took a plane) is true, then the consequent (Erin took a train) must also be true.\n4. Since we know that the consequent \"Erin took a train\" is true, we can infer that the antecedent \"Sam took a plane\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
