This means that if the vampire was awake, then it necessarily follows that the mummy was also awake.\n\nThe second statement, \"The mummy was awake,\" is a true statement.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the statement \"The vampire was awake\" is true or not.\n\nIf the mummy was awake (as stated in the second statement), and the first statement is true, then it must follow that the vampire was also awake. This is because the first statement says that if the vampire was awake, the mummy was awake, and we know the mummy was awake.\n\nTherefore, the logical conclusion is that the statement \"The vampire was awake\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"

This is because the statement is in the form of a conditional statement, where the antecedent (the vampire was awake) implies the consequent (the mummy was awake).\n\nNow, we know that the mummy was awake (the second statement).
