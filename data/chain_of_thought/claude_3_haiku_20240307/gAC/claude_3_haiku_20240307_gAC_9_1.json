We are given the following premises:\n   - If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n   - Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n2. We need to determine if the statement \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true.\n\n3. The first premise tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This means that if the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the consequent (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\n4. The second premise tells us that Mark bought the blue shirt, which is the consequent of the first premise.\n\n5. Since the consequent of the first premise is true (Mark bought the blue shirt), we can infer that the antecedent of the first premise (Lisa bought the red shirt) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
