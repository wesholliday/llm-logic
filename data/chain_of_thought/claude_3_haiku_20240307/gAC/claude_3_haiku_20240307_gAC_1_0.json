We are also given that \"Sue was at the wedding\" is true.\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This means that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary must have been at the wedding as well.\n4. Since we know that Sue was at the wedding, we can conclude that Mary must have been at the wedding as well.\n\nAnswer: yes"
