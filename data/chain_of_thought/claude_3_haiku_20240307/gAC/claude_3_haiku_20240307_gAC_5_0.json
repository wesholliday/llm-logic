This means that if the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) is true, then the consequent (Amy played tennis) must also be true. However, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. In other words, just because Amy played tennis, it does not necessarily mean that Jeff played basketball.\n\nThe second statement, \"Amy played tennis,\" is true.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Does it follow that 'Jeff played basketball' is true?\"\n\nTo answer this, we need to look at the logical implications of the given information.\n\nSince we know that \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is true, and \"Amy played tennis\" is also true, we can conclude that the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) must also be true. This is because the conditional statement is true, and the consequent (Amy played tennis) is true, which means the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
