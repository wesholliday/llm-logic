If the dog was inside (P is true), then the cat was outside (Q is true).\n2. If the dog was not inside (P is false), then the cat could still be outside (Q could still be true).\n\nThe second statement, \"The cat was outside\", confirms that Q is true. However, this does not automatically mean that P (the dog was inside) is also true.\n\nThe information given does not allow us to conclude that \"The dog was inside\" is true. It is possible that the dog was not inside, and the cat was still outside.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no"
