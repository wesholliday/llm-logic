However, this statement does not tell us whether Ben actually ate pasta or not.\n\nThe second statement tells us that \"Kate ate salad\" is true. This means that the consequent (Kate ate salad) of the first conditional statement is true.\n\nNow, the question is whether we can infer from these two pieces of information that \"Ben ate pasta\" is true.\n\nIn a conditional statement, the truth of the consequent (Kate ate salad) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (Ben ate pasta).
