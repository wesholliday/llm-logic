However, this does not necessarily mean that if the pants were denim, the shirt was cotton.\n\nThe second statement is \"The pants were denim,\" which is true.\n\nNow, the question is whether we can conclude that \"The shirt was cotton\" is true.\n\nTo do this, we need to consider the logical rules of implication. The first statement, \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,\" does not guarantee that the shirt was cotton just because the pants were denim. The conditional statement only tells us that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim, but it does not tell us anything about the reverse implication.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot conclude that \"The shirt was cotton\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
