It simply states that taking medication will lead to feeling better. This premise does not provide any information about whether the medication is expired or not.\n\nThe proposed inference 'If I take medication that expired, I will feel better' suggests that expired medication will have the same effect as non-expired medication, which is to make the person feel better. However, this inference is not valid based on the given premise.\n\nExpired medication may have lost its potency or effectiveness, and it may not have the desired effect of making the person feel better. The premise 'If I take medication, I will feel better' does not necessarily imply that taking expired medication will also lead to feeling better.\n\nTherefore, the inference 'If I take medication that expired, I will feel better' cannot be made from the premise 'If I take medication, I will feel better'.\n\nAnswer: no"

In other words, the truth of the premise must guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nHowever, in this case, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise. Just because taking medication (in general) leads to feeling better, it does not imply that taking expired medication will also lead to feeling better. Expired medication may not have the same therapeutic effect or may even be harmful.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"If I take medication that expired, I will feel better\" cannot be inferred from the premise \"If I take medication, I will feel better.\"\n\nAnswer: no"

However, this statement does not specify the condition of the medication, whether it is expired or not.\n\nThe proposed inference, 'If I take medication that expired, I will feel better', is also a conditional statement, but it introduces a new condition (the medication being expired) that is not present in the original statement.\n\nThe key question is whether the expiration of the medication would not affect the outcome of feeling better.
