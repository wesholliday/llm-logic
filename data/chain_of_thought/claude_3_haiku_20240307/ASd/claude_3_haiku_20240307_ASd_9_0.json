The original statement must be true.\n2. The new statement must be a logical consequence of the original statement.\n\nIn this case, the original statement is true, but the new statement is not a logical consequence of the original statement. The fact that the essay is well-written does not necessarily imply that the student will get an A if the essay is turned in late. There may be other factors, such as the grading policy, that could affect the student's grade.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
