It states that if the condition of going to the concert is met, then the consequence of having a good time will follow.\n\nHowever, the proposed inference \"If we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time\" introduces an additional condition, which is the occurrence of a bomb going off. This additional condition is not present in the original statement.\n\nThe addition of the new condition \"and a bomb goes off\" changes the meaning of the statement, and it is not a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
