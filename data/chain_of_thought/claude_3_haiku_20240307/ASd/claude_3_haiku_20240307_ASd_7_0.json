It states that if the condition 'the oven is on' is true, then the consequence 'the kitchen is warm' is also true.\n\nNow, the proposed inference 'If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm' is also a conditional statement. It states that if the condition 'the oven is on and the pilot light is out' is true, then the consequence 'the kitchen is warm' is also true.\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we need to consider the relationship between the two conditions. The condition 'the oven is on and the pilot light is out' is more specific than the original condition 'the oven is on'. This means that if the more specific condition is true, then the original condition is also true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm' from the given statement 'If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
