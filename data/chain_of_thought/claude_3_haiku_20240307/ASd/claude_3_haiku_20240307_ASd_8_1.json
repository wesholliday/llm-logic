The given statement is a conditional statement, which means that it establishes a relationship between two events: the package being shipped and the package arriving today.\n2. The proposed inference adds an additional condition, \"and it was misrouted,\" to the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the statement.\n3. The consequent (the \"then\" part) of the statement remains the same, which is \"it will arrive today.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationship between the given statement and the proposed inference.\n\nThe given statement, \"If the package has shipped, then it will arrive today,\" does not necessarily imply the proposed inference, \"If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today.\"\n\nThe reason is that the given statement only requires the package to have been shipped for it to arrive today, but the proposed inference adds an additional condition (the package being misrouted) that is not present in the original statement.\n\nIn other words, the proposed inference is a stronger statement that adds additional information to the original conditional statement. The original statement does not guarantee that the package will arrive today if it was misrouted, even though it was shipped.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the proposed statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
