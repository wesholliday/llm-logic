This means that if the condition (watering the plants) is met, then the conclusion (the plants will grow) follows.\n\nHowever, the new statement 'If I water the plants and there is no sunlight, they will grow' adds an additional condition (no sunlight) to the original statement. This means that the new statement is a stronger claim, as it requires both conditions (watering and no sunlight) to be true for the conclusion (the plants will grow) to follow.\n\nSince the original statement does not specify the presence or absence of sunlight, we cannot infer that the plants will grow in the absence of sunlight, even if they are watered. The original statement does not provide enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no"

This means that it establishes a relationship between two events: watering the plants and the plants growing. However, this statement does not specify the condition of sunlight. It only states that if the plants are watered, they will grow, without mentioning the presence or absence of sunlight.\n\nTo infer that 'If I water the plants and there is no sunlight, they will grow', we would need to assume that the absence of sunlight does not affect the plants' ability to grow when they are watered.
