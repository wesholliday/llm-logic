The condition in the new statement is more specific, requiring both finishing the homework and the computer catching on fire.\n\nFor the new statement to be true, both conditions (finishing the homework and the computer catching on fire) would need to be met in order to play video games.

In other words, does the computer catching on fire have any impact on the ability to play video games, given that the homework has been finished?\n\nThe answer is no.
