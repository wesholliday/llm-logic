It states that if the match is struck, then the match will light. This statement does not make any assumptions about the condition of the match, such as whether it has been soaked in water or not.\n\nThe proposed inference 'If the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will light' is also a conditional statement. This statement adds an additional condition, that the match has been soaked in water, to the original statement.\n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide any information about the condition of the match. It only states that if the match is struck, then it will light, regardless of any other factors.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the proposed statement 'If the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will light' from the given statement 'If the match is struck, then it will light'.\n\nAnswer: no"
