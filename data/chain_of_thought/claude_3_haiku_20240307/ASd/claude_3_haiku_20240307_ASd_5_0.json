It states that if the condition 'the bill is paid' is true, then the consequence 'the services will continue' is also true.\n\nHowever, the statement 'If the bill is paid and the check bounces, then the services will continue' introduces an additional condition 'the check bounces' that is not present in the original statement.\n\nThe original statement does not make any claims about what would happen if the check bounces. It only states that if the bill is paid, then the services will continue. The additional condition 'the check bounces' is not accounted for in the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the bill is paid and the check bounces, then the services will continue' from the given statement 'If the bill is paid, then the services will continue'.\n\nAnswer: no"
