It states that if the condition 'I study hard' is true, then the conclusion 'I will pass the test' is also true.\n\nHowever, the new statement 'If I study hard and the test is in Chinese, I will pass the test' adds an additional condition 'the test is in Chinese'. This new condition is not present in the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original statement, as the new statement has an additional condition that is not accounted for in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
