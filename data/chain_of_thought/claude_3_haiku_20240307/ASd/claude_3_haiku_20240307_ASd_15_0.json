It states that if the condition \"I charge my phone\" is true, then the consequence \"it will have power\" is also true.\n\nThe proposed inference \"If I charge my phone and it has a dead battery, it will have power\" is also a conditional statement. It states that if the condition \"I charge my phone and it has a dead battery\" is true, then the consequence \"it will have power\" is also true.\n\nTo determine if the proposed inference is valid, we need to consider the relationship between the conditions in the two statements.\n\nThe condition \"I charge my phone\" in the given statement is a subset of the condition \"I charge my phone and it has a dead battery\" in the proposed inference. This means that if the condition \"I charge my phone and it has a dead battery\" is true, then the condition \"I charge my phone\" is also true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the condition \"I charge my phone and it has a dead battery\" is true, then the consequence \"it will have power\" is also true, based on the given statement \"If I charge my phone, it will have power\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
