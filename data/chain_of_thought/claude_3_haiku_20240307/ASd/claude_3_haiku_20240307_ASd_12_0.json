It states that the condition of finishing homework is sufficient for the consequence of being able to play video games.\n\nHowever, the proposed inference 'If I finish my homework and my computer catches on fire, I can play video games' introduces an additional condition (the computer catching on fire) that is not present in the original statement.\n\nThe additional condition is not logically implied by the original statement. Just because finishing homework is sufficient for playing video games, it does not necessarily mean that finishing homework and the computer catching on fire is also sufficient for playing video games.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the proposed statement from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
