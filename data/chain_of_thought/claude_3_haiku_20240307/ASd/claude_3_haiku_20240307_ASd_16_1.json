This means that the new statement is making a stronger claim, as it requires both the lawn to be fertilized and a drought to occur for the lawn to be lush and green.\n\nThe original statement does not necessarily imply the new statement, as the presence of a drought could potentially negate the positive effects of fertilizing the lawn, resulting in the lawn not being lush and green despite being fertilized.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"

However, it does not necessarily mean that fertilizing the lawn is the only condition for the lawn to be lush and green.\n\nThe additional condition of 'there is a drought' introduces a new factor that could potentially affect the outcome. During a drought, the lawn may not receive enough water, which could impact its ability to be lush and green, even if it is fertilized.\n\nTherefore, we cannot reliably infer that 'If I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green' from the original statement. The introduction of the drought condition may change the outcome, and the original statement does not guarantee the lush and green appearance of the lawn under those circumstances.\n\nAnswer: no"

However, this statement does not necessarily imply that the lush and green condition will be maintained in all circumstances, including a drought.\n\nThe additional condition 'and there is a drought' introduced in the second statement introduces a new factor that could potentially affect the outcome.

The original statement only guarantees the outcome (lush and green) if the first condition (fertilizing the lawn) is met, but it does not guarantee the outcome if an additional condition (a drought) is also present.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green' from the original statement 'If I fertilize the lawn, it will be lush and green'.\n\nAnswer: no"
