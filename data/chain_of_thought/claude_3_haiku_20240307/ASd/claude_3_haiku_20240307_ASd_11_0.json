            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired' from 'If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired', we need to consider the logical implications of the given statement.\n\nThe original statement, 'If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired', is a conditional statement. It suggests that if the condition of getting enough sleep is met, then the consequence of not being tired will follow.\n\nHowever, the proposed inference, 'If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired', introduces an additional condition of doing hard labor. This new condition is not present in the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the addition of a new condition to the antecedent (the 'if' part) of a conditional statement does not necessarily preserve the truth of the original statement. The new statement may or may not be true, depending on the specific relationship between the conditions and the consequence.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired' from the original statement 'If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired'.\n\nAnswer: no"
