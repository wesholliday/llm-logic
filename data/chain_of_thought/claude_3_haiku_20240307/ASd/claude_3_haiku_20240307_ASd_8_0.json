It states that if the condition \"the package has shipped\" is true, then the conclusion \"the package will arrive today\" is also true.\n\nThe proposed inference \"If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today\" is also a conditional statement. It states that if the conditions \"the package has shipped\" and \"the package was misrouted\" are both true, then the conclusion \"the package will arrive today\" is also true.\n\nThe key difference between the two statements is the additional condition \"the package was misrouted\" in the proposed inference.\n\nThe original statement does not make any assumptions about whether the package was misrouted or not. It simply states that if the package has shipped, it will arrive today, regardless of any potential misrouting.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the proposed statement \"If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today\" from the given statement \"If the package has shipped, then it will arrive today\". The additional condition of the package being misrouted is not accounted for in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
