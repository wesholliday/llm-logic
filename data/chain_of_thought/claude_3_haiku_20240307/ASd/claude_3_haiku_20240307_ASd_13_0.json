It suggests that if the condition of exercising is met, then the consequence of losing weight will occur.\n\nHowever, the new statement, 'If I exercise and eat junk food, I will lose weight', introduces an additional condition (eating junk food) that is not present in the original statement.\n\nThe original statement does not make any claims about the effects of exercising and eating junk food simultaneously. It only states that exercising alone will lead to weight loss.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original statement, as the new statement includes an additional condition that is not addressed in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
