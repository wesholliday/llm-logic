            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The document must have been signed or notarized\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true for the statement to be true. This statement does not imply that both conditions must be true, but rather that either one or the other condition must be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statement, we cannot infer \"The document must have been signed or it must have been notarized.\" This would be a stronger statement that requires both conditions to be true, which is not necessarily the case in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
