            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The package must have been delivered by truck or by plane\" is a disjunctive statement, which means that at least one of the two options is true, but it does not specify which one. This statement does not imply that the package was delivered by both truck and plane, but rather that it was delivered by either truck or plane.\n\nThe statement \"The package must have been delivered by truck or it must have been delivered by plane\" is also a disjunctive statement, but it is more specific than the original statement. It explicitly states that the package was delivered by either truck or plane, but not both.\n\nSince the original statement does not rule out the possibility that the package was delivered by both truck and plane, the more specific statement \"The package must have been delivered by truck or it must have been delivered by plane\" cannot be directly inferred from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
