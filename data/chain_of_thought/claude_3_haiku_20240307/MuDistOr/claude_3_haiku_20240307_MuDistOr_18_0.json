This statement does not imply that both conditions must be true simultaneously.\n\nThe statement \"The product must have been eco-friendly or it must have been recyclable\" is also a disjunctive statement, and it is logically equivalent to the original statement. This is because the \"or\" in both statements has the same meaning, which is that at least one of the two conditions must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the two statements are logically equivalent, and the answer to the given question is yes.\n\nAnswer: yes"
