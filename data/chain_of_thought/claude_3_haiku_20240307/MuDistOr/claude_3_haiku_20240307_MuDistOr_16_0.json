            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The contract must have been approved by the legal team or the CEO\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true for the statement to be true. This can be represented as:\n\n(The contract was approved by the legal team) OR (The contract was approved by the CEO)\n\nThe question is asking whether we can infer the statement \"The contract must have been approved by the legal team or it must have been approved by the CEO\" from the given statement.\n\nThe key difference between the two statements is the use of the word \"or\" in the original statement versus the use of the word \"it\" in the inferred statement. The original statement allows for the possibility that the contract was approved by both the legal team and the CEO, while the inferred statement suggests that the contract was approved by either the legal team or the CEO, but not both.\n\nHowever, the original statement does not preclude the possibility that the contract was approved by both the legal team and the CEO. Therefore, the inferred statement is a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
