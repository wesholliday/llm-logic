The original statement does not make this distinction, as it only states that the keys were in one of the two locations, without specifying that they were in one or the other.\n\nTherefore, the inference you provided is not valid, as the original statement does not necessarily imply that the keys must have been in one location or the other, but rather that they were in at least one of the two locations.\n\nAnswer: no"
