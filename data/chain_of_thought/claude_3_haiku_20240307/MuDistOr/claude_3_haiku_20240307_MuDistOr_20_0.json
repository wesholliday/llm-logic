It does not necessarily imply that both conditions must be true.\n\nThe statement can be interpreted as saying that the building had either an elevator or wheelchair ramps, or both. It does not specify that the building must have had both an elevator and wheelchair ramps.\n\nTherefore, from the given statement, we cannot infer that \"The building must have had an elevator or it must have had wheelchair ramps.\" The original statement allows for the possibility that the building had both an elevator and wheelchair ramps.\n\nAnswer: no"
