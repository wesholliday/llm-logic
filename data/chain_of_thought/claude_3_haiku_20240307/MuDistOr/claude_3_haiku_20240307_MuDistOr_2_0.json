            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The car must have been in the garage or at the repair shop\" is a disjunctive statement, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. This statement does not imply that both conditions must be true simultaneously.\n\nThe statement \"The car must have been in the garage or it must have been at the repair shop\" is also a disjunctive statement, but it is more specific than the original statement. It explicitly states that the car must have been in one of the two locations, but not necessarily both.\n\nSince the original statement allows for the possibility that the car could have been in the garage and at the repair shop at the same time, the more specific statement \"The car must have been in the garage or it must have been at the repair shop\" can be inferred from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
