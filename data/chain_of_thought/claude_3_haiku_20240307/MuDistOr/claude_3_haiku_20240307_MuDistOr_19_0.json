This statement does not imply that the candidate must have had both a degree and relevant work experience. It only requires that the candidate has one or the other, or both.\n\nTherefore, from the given statement, we can infer that \"The candidate must have had a degree or they must have had relevant work experience\" is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
