This is known as the distributive property of disjunction.\n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide enough information to determine which of the two options (salad or soup) is true. It only states that one of them must be true, but not which one specifically.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The meal must have included a salad or it must have included soup\" from the given statement \"The meal must have included a salad or soup\".\n\nAnswer: no"
