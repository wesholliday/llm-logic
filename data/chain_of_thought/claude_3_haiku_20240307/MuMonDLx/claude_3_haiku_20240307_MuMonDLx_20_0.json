It states that the wozzle is a floob, without providing any additional information. \n\nTo infer \"The wozzle must be floob or glorp\" from this statement, we would need to have additional information that the wozzle could be either a floob or a glorp. The original statement does not provide any such information. It only states that the wozzle is a floob, without mentioning any other possibilities.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically infer that \"The wozzle must be floob or glorp\" from the statement \"The wozzle must be floob\".\n\nAnswer: no"
