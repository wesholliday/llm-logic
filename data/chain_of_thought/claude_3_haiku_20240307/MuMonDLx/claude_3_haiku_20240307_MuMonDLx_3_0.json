The original statement only indicates that the zibber is located within the floob, but it does not specify whether the zibber is completely inside the floob or could also be on the surface of the floob.\n\nTo infer that the zibber must be either in the floob or on the floob, we would need additional information that suggests the zibber could be in either of those two locations. The original statement does not provide that level of detail.\n\nAnswer: No"
