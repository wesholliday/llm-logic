This statement does not provide any information about whether the zibble could also be plonk. \n\nTo infer \"The zibble must be glorp or plonk\" from the original statement, we would need to know that the zibble can only be one of two possibilities: glorp or plonk. Without any additional information about the possible states of the zibble, we cannot logically conclude that it must be either glorp or plonk.\n\nAnswer: no"
