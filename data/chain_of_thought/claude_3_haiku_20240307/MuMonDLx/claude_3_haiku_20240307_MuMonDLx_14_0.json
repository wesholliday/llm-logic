The original statement only mentions a \"snork\", and there is no indication that a \"snorkel\" is also included. Without additional context or information, we cannot logically conclude that the original statement implies the broader statement including \"snorkel\". The original statement is too specific to allow for such an inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
