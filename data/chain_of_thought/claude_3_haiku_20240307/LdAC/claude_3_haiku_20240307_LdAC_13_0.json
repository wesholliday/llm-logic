The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\n2. The second statement is the antecedent of the conditional statement: \"The truck was blue.\"\n3. From the conditional statement and the second statement, we can apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n4. In this case, the conditional statement is \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue,\" and the antecedent \"The truck was blue\" is true. Therefore, we can logically deduce that the consequent \"The car was red\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
