The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This means that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\n2. The second statement is a direct statement: \"The muffins were blueberry.\" This means that the muffins were indeed blueberry.\n\nNow, let's consider the deduction:\n\nThe first statement tells us that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. The second statement tells us that the muffins were blueberry. However, the first statement does not tell us anything about the actual color of the cake. It only tells us that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce from the given information that 'The cake was chocolate'. The information provided is not sufficient to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
