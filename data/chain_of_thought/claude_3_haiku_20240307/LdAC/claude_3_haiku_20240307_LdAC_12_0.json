The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This means that if the condition \"Joe went to the park\" is true, then the consequence \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is also true.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" This means that the consequence \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is true.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical reasoning:\n\nIf the first statement is true, and the consequence \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is true, then we can logically deduce that the condition \"Joe went to the park\" must also be true.\n\nHowever, the information given does not allow us to determine the truth value of the first statement. We only know that the consequence \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is true, but we don't know if the condition \"Joe went to the park\" is true or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically deduce that \"Joe went to the park.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
