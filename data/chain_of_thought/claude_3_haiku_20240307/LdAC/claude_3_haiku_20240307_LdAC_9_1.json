The question is whether we can logically deduce from these premises that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\".\n\nReasoning:\nThe first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the consequent (Mark bought the blue shirt) is also true.\n\nThe second premise tells us that the consequent of the first premise is true (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, if the consequent of a conditional statement is true, and we know the conditional statement itself is true, then we can infer that the antecedent of the conditional statement is also true.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can logically deduce that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
