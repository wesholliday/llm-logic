The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This means that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the mummy was awake, the vampire was also awake.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"The mummy was awake.\" This means that the mummy was indeed awake.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical deduction:\n- From the first statement, we know that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n- The second statement tells us that the mummy was awake.\n- However, we cannot logically deduce from this information that the vampire was awake. The first statement only tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake, but it does not tell us the reverse.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce 'The vampire was awake' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
