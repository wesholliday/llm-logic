The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\"\n2. The second statement is the antecedent of the conditional statement: \"The robot visited Jupiter.\"\n3. From the conditional statement and the second statement, we can apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n4. In this case, the antecedent \"the robot visited Jupiter\" is true, so we can deduce that the consequent \"the alien visited Mars\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
