The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This means that if the antecedent (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequent (Jen watched basketball) is also true.\n\n2. The second statement tells us that \"Jen watched basketball.\" This is the same as the consequent of the first statement.\n\n3. To deduce the antecedent (Tom watched football) from the given information, we would need to use the logical inference known as modus ponens. Modus ponens states that if a conditional statement is true and the consequent is true, then the antecedent must also be true.\n\nHowever, in this case, we do not have enough information to apply modus ponens, as the first statement is a conditional statement, but we do not know if the antecedent (Tom watched football) is true or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce 'Tom watched football' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
