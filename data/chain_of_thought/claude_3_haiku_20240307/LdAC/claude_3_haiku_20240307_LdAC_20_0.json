However, this does not necessarily mean that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement: \"The banana was yellow.\" This statement is true, as it is given.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical deduction:\n- From the first statement, we know that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n- The second statement tells us that the banana was yellow.\n- However, this does not necessarily mean that the apple was red. The first statement only tells us that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow, but it does not tell us the converse, which would be \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\"\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce 'The apple was red' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
