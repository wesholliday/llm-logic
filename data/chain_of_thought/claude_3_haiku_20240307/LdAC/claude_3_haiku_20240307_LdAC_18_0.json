The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n2. The second statement is a categorical statement: \"The truck was metal.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n- The first statement tells us that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This means that the truck being metal is a necessary consequence of the doll being plastic.\n- The second statement tells us that the truck was metal.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that the antecedent of the conditional statement (the doll being plastic) must be true, since the consequent (the truck being metal) is true.\n\nTherefore, we can logically deduce that 'The doll was plastic'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
