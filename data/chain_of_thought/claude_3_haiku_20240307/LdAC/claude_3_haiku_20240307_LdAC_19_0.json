The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This means that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Jen watched basketball.\" This means that Jen did, in fact, watch basketball.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical deduction:\n- Since we know that Jen watched basketball, and the first statement tells us that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball, we can conclude that Tom must have watched football.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can logically deduce that 'Tom watched football.'\n\nAnswer: yes"
