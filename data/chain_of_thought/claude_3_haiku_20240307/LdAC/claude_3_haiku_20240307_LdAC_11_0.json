The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"The muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the logical deduction:\n* The first statement tells us that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n* The second statement tells us that the muffins were blueberry.\n* From this, we can conclude that the cake was chocolate.\n\nThis is because the second statement affirms the consequent of the conditional statement, which allows us to infer the antecedent (the cake was chocolate).\n\nAnswer: yes"
