The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\"\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the logical reasoning:\n- The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) is true, then the consequent (Amy played tennis) must also be true.\n- The second statement tells us that the consequent (Amy played tennis) is true.\n- However, the first statement does not tell us anything about the truth of the antecedent (Jeff played basketball). It only tells us that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot logically deduce that \"Jeff played basketball.\" The truth of the antecedent is not guaranteed by the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no"
