The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\"\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"The cat was outside.\"\n3. To deduce 'The dog was inside' from these two statements, we need to use the rule of modus ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (if P, then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then we can conclude the consequent (Q) is true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" The second statement, \"The cat was outside,\" confirms the consequent (Q) of the conditional statement.\n\nHowever, we cannot logically deduce 'The dog was inside' from these two statements alone. The reason is that the conditional statement does not tell us anything about the truth of the antecedent (P), which is \"the dog was inside.\" The second statement, \"The cat was outside,\" does not provide any information about the location of the dog.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically deduce 'The dog was inside.'\n\nAnswer: no"
