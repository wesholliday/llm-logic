If the conclusion of the first statement (the pants were denim) is true, and the second statement also states that the pants were denim, then we can infer that the condition of the first statement (the shirt was cotton) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can logically deduce that \"The shirt was cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
