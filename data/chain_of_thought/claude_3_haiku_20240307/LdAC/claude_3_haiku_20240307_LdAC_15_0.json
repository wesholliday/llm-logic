The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This means that if the condition \"Sam took a plane\" is true, then the consequence \"Erin took a train\" is also true.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Erin took a train.\" This means that the consequence \"Erin took a train\" is true.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical deduction:\n- If the first statement is true, and the consequence \"Erin took a train\" is true, then the condition \"Sam took a plane\" must also be true.\n- However, the second statement only tells us that \"Erin took a train,\" and does not provide any information about whether \"Sam took a plane\" or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce \"Sam took a plane\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
