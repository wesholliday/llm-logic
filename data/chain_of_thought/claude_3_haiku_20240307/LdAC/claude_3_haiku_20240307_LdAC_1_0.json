The first statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. However, this statement does not tell us anything about whether Mary was actually at the wedding or not.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a categorical statement that directly tells us that Sue was present at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical deduction:\n- From the first statement, we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n- The second statement tells us that Sue was at the wedding.\n- However, the first statement does not tell us anything about whether Mary was at the wedding or not. It only tells us that if Mary was there, then Sue was there as well.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce that \"Mary was at the wedding\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
