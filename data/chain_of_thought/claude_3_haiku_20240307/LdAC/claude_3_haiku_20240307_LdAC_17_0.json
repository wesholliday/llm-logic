The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This means that if Ben ate pasta, then it necessarily follows that Kate ate salad.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Kate ate salad.\" This means that Kate did, in fact, eat salad.\n\n3. Now, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. Since the second statement confirms that Kate ate salad, and the first statement tells us that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad, we can infer that Ben must have eaten pasta.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can logically deduce that 'Ben ate pasta.'\n\nAnswer: yes"
