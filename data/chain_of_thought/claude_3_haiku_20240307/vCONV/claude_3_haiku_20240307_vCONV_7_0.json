This form of argument is known as the \"converse\" of the original implication.\n\nIn general, the converse of an implication is not logically valid. Just because the original implication is true, it does not necessarily mean that the converse is also true.\n\nTherefore, the given argument form is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
