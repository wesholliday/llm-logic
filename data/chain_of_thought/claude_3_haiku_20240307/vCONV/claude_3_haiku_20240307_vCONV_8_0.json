The converse of a conditional statement (if-then statement) is obtained by switching the order of the antecedent and the consequent.\n\nIn general, the converse of a valid conditional statement is not necessarily valid. The converse of a valid conditional statement may or may not be valid, depending on the specific relationship between the antecedent and the consequent.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
