The converse of an implication is not logically valid, as it does not necessarily follow from the original implication.\n\nIn other words, just because the statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true, it does not necessarily mean that the statement \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt\" is also true.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
