The converse of an implication is not logically valid, as it does not necessarily follow from the original implication.\n\nIn other words, just because the statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is true, it does not mean that the statement \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton\" is also true.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
