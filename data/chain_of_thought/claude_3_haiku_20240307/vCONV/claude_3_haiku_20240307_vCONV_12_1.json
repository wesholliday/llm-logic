In other words, if the premise is true, does the conclusion also have to be true?\n\nIn this case, the argument form is known as the \"converse\" of the original premise. The converse of a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is the statement (Q \u2192 P), which is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nThe converse of a conditional statement is not always true, even if the original statement is true.
