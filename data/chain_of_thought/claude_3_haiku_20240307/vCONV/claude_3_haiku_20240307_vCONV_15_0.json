In other words, the conclusion is the converse of the premise.\n\nThe converse of an implication is not logically valid. Just because the statement \"If P, then Q\" is true, it does not necessarily mean that the statement \"If Q, then P\" is also true.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
