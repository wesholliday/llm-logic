The converse of an implication is not logically valid, as it does not necessarily follow from the original implication.\n\nIn other words, just because the statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is true, it does not mean that the statement \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate\" is also true.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
