The converse of an implication is not necessarily logically valid.\n\nIn order for the converse to be logically valid, the original implication must be a biconditional statement, meaning that the two statements are logically equivalent (i.e., P if and only if Q).\n\nHowever, the given premise does not state a biconditional relationship. It only states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel, but it does not necessarily mean that all mystery novels are written by James.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
