The converse of an implication is not necessarily true, even if the original implication is true.\n\nIn other words, the truth of the premise \"If the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den\" does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case.\"\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
