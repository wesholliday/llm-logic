The converse of an implication is not necessarily logically valid.\n\nIn other words, the truth of the premise \"If P, then Q\" does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion \"If Q, then P.\" The converse can be false even if the original implication is true.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
