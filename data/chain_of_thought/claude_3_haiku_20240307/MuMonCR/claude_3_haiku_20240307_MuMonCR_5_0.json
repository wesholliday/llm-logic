The package was signed for.\n\nThe question is asking whether we can infer from this statement that \"The package must have been signed for.\"\n\nSince the original statement explicitly states that the package was signed for, we can directly infer that the package must have been signed for. The fact that the package was delivered today and signed for means that the package was indeed signed for.\n\nAnswer: yes"
