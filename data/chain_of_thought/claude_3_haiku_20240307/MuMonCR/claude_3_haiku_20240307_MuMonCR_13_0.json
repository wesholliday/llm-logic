The movie must have been in English.\n2. The movie must have had subtitles.\n\nThe key word in the question is 'infer', which means to draw a conclusion based on the given information.\n\nSince the original statement explicitly states that the movie had subtitles, we can directly infer that 'The movie must have had subtitles' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
