It must have been taken with food.\n2. It must have been taken twice daily.\n\nTo answer the question, we need to determine if the second piece of information (taken twice daily) can be inferred from the given statement.\n\nThe statement explicitly mentions that the medicine must have been taken twice daily. Therefore, we can directly infer that the medicine must have been taken twice daily.\n\nAnswer: yes"
