            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The software must have been restarted' from the given statement 'The software must have been updated and restarted', we need to consider the logical relationship between the two parts of the statement.\n\nThe statement 'The software must have been updated and restarted' implies that two actions have occurred: the software was updated and the software was restarted. The use of the word 'and' indicates that both of these actions happened.\n\nTherefore, if the software must have been updated and restarted, it logically follows that the software must have been restarted. The restarting of the software is a necessary consequence of the software being updated and restarted.\n\nAnswer: yes"
