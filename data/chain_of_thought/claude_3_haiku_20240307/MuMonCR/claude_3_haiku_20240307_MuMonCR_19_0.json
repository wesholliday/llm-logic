            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is \"The application must have been completed online and included references\". This statement has two parts connected by the word \"and\", which means that both parts must be true for the overall statement to be true.\n\nThe first part, \"The application must have been completed online\", does not provide any information about whether the application included references or not. The second part, \"and included references\", directly states that the application included references.\n\nSince the overall statement requires both parts to be true, we can infer that the application must have included references. The statement does not provide any information about whether the application was required to include references or not, but it does state that the application did include references.\n\nAnswer: yes"
