            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM\" provides two pieces of information: 1) the concert was sold out, and 2) the concert started at 8 PM. \n\nTo determine if we can infer that \"The concert must have started at 8 PM\" from this information, we need to consider whether the fact that the concert was sold out necessarily implies that it started at 8 PM.\n\nWhile the statement indicates that the concert started at 8 PM, it does not explicitly state that the fact of the concert being sold out is directly related to the start time. It is possible that the concert could have been sold out and started at a different time, such as 7 PM or 9 PM.\n\nTherefore, the information provided in the given statement is not sufficient to infer that the concert must have started at 8 PM.\n\nAnswer: no"
