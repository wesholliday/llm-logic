This means that the location of the meeting (the conference room) is a necessary part of the statement, and not just a coincidental detail.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The meeting must have been in the conference room\" from the given statement, as the location of the conference room is a necessary part of the information provided.\n\nAnswer: yes"
