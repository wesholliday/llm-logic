The second premise is \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have tinked.\"\n3. We want to determine if we can infer \"The whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\nReasoning:\n- The first premise tells us that if the whiffle was shanked, then it must have tinked.\n- The second premise tells us that it's not the case that the whiffle must have tinked.\n- This means that the condition in the first premise (the whiffle being shanked) cannot be true, because if it were true, then the whiffle must have tinked, which is contradicted by the second premise.\n- Therefore, we can infer that \"The whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
