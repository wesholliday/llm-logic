We are given the following two statements:\n   - \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked\"\n   - \"It's not the case that the splat must have quanked\"\n\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked. This means that the splat quanking is a necessary consequence of the splat being morphed.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that it is not the case that the splat must have quanked. This means that the splat did not necessarily quank.\n\n4. Now, let's consider the original question: \"Can we infer 'The splat was not morphed'?\"\n\n5. If the splat did not necessarily quank (from the second statement), and quanking is a necessary consequence of the splat being morphed (from the first statement), then we can conclude that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes"

The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked.\n2. The second statement is the negation of the conclusion of the first statement. It says that it's not the case that the splat must have quanked.\n3.
