It says that if the zinger was fraggled, then it must have been smoogled. This means that if the zinger was not smoogled, then it must not have been fraggled.\n5) The second statement says that it's not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled.

The first statement is \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the zinger was fraggled, then it must have been smoogled.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled.\" This means that the zinger was not smoogled.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the first statement again. If the zinger was fraggled, then it must have been smoogled. However, the second statement tells us that the zinger was not smoogled. This means that the zinger could not have been fraggled, because if it was fraggled, it would have been smoogled, which we know is not the case.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
