The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the flug was not blummed, then it was not zimmed either. This is because the statement says that if the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed. The contrapositive of this statement is that if the flug was not zimmed, then it was not blummed.\n4. The second statement tells us that it is not the case that the flug must have been zimmed. This means that the flug was not zimmed.\n5. Combining the conclusions from steps 3 and 4, we can infer that the flug was not blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
