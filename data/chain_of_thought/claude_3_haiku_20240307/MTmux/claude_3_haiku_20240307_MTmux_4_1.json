This can be written in symbolic logic as: \"If P, then Q\".\n\n2. The second premise is \"It's not the case that the fribble must have crinked\". This can be written in symbolic logic as: \"Not Q\".\n\n3. From the first premise, we can infer that if the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink. This can be written as: \"If not P, then not Q\".\n\n4. Combining the second premise (not Q) with the inference from the first premise (if not P, then not Q), we can conclude that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"

The first premise is \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the fribble was snurgled) is true, then the consequent (the fribble must have crinked) must also be true.\n\n2. The second premise is \"It's not the case that the fribble must have crinked.\" This is the negation of the consequent from the first premise.\n\n3. If the negation of the consequent is true, then the antecedent must be false, according to the rule of modus tollens. This means that if it's not the case that the fribble must have crinked, then the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The fribble was not snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
