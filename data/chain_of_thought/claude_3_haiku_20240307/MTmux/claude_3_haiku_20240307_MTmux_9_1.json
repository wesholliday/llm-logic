'If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished'\n   This statement implies that if the twonk was plinked, then it was also varnished.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the twonk must have been varnished'\n   This statement negates the conclusion that the twonk must have been varnished.\n\nNow, let's consider the inference 'The twonk was not plinked'.\n\nIf the twonk was not varnished (as stated in the second premise), then it could not have been plinked, according to the first premise. This is because the first premise states that if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that 'The twonk was not plinked'.\n\nAnswer: yes"

The second statement tells us that it's not the case that the twonk must have been varnished. This means that the twonk was not necessarily varnished.\n\n4.
