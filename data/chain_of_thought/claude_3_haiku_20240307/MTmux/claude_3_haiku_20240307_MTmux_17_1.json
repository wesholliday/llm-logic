It's not the case that the flob must have movated.\n\nTo infer 'The flob was not skizzled', we need to use the contrapositive of the first statement, which is:\nIf the flob did not move, then the flob was not skizzled.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that it is not the case that the flob must have movated. This means that the flob did not move.\n\nApplying the contrapositive, we can infer that the flob was not skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
