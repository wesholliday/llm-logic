The first statement is: 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged.'\n2. The second statement is: 'It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged.'\n3. From the first statement, we can say that if the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged. This is a conditional statement.\n4. The second statement tells us that it is not the case that the clug must have been snugged. This means that the clug was not snugged.\n5. Since the first statement tells us that if the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged, and the second statement tells us that the clug was not snugged, we can infer that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes"

The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the clug was fleeked) is true, then the consequent (the clug must have been snugged) must also be true.\n2. The second statement is the negation of the consequent from the first statement, which means that the clug must not have been snugged.\n3. If the consequent of the first statement is false, then the antecedent must also be false, according to the contrapositive rule of logic.\n4.
