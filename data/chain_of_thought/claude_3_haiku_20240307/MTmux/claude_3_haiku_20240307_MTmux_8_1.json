The first statement is \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled.\n\n2. The second statement is \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled.\" This is the negation of the consequent in the first statement, which means that the sprocket was not daggled.\n\n3. Now, we need to use the rule of contraposition to infer the answer. Contraposition states that if \"If A, then B\" is true, then \"If not B, then not A\" is also true.\n\n4.
