It's not the case that the wug must have bimmed the zoint.\n\nFrom the first premise, we can infer that if the wug was not flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint. This is because the premise states that if the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint. This implies the contrapositive, which is that if the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\n\nThe second premise tells us that the wug did not bim the zoint.
