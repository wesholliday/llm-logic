The second statement is \"It's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the flug was not blummed, then it was not zimmed. This is because the first statement is a conditional statement, and the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n4.
