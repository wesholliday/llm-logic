The first premise is \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the whiffle was shanked, then it must have tinked.\n\n2. The second premise is \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have tinked.\" This means that it is not true that the whiffle must have tinked.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the first premise again. If the whiffle was shanked, then it must have tinked. However, the second premise tells us that it is not the case that the whiffle must have tinked. This means that the antecedent of the first premise, \"the whiffle was shanked,\" must be false.\n\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"The whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
