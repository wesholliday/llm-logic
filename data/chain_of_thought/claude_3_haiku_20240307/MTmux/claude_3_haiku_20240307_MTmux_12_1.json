We are given the following two premises:\n   - \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint\"\n   - \"It's not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint\"\n\n2. From the first premise, we can infer that if the smip was not shripped, then it did not lupp the zoint. This is because the premise states that if the smip was shripped, then it must have lupped the zoint.\n\n3. The second premise tells us that it is not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint. This means that the smip did not lupp the zoint.\n\n4.

'If the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint':\n   This statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint':\n   This statement is the negation of the conclusion in the first statement. It means that it is not true that the smip must have lupped the zoint.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these two statements:\n\nIf the first statement is true, and the second statement is also true, then we can infer that the antecedent of the first statement (i.e., 'the smip was shripped') must be false.\n\nThis is because if the smip was shripped, then it must have lupped the zoint according to the first statement. However, the second statement tells us that it is not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint. Therefore, the only way for both statements to be true is if the smip was not shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes"
