The conclusion states that if the customer was served promptly, then he was not served.

The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the premise \"Served \u2192 \u00acPromptly\" is \"Promptly \u2192 \u00acServed,\" which is the same as the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
