The premise is a conditional statement: \"If a recommendation was made, then it was not a strong recommendation.\"\n2. The conclusion is also a conditional statement: \"If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made.\"\n\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if a recommendation was made, then it was not a strong recommendation. This means that if a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premise, and the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
