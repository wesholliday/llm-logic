The premise states that if you went to the store, then you did not buy vegetables. This can be expressed in symbolic logic as:\n   Premise: \"If I went to the store, then not (I bought vegetables).\"\n   In other words, the premise is saying that going to the store and buying vegetables are mutually exclusive events.\n\n2. The conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of \"If A, then not B\" is \"If B, then not A.\"\n   Conclusion: \"If I bought vegetables, then not (I went to the store).\"\n   This means that if you bought vegetables, then you did not go to the store.\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premise, and the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
