The premise states that if the issue was addressed, then it was not addressed effectively. This can be represented as:\n   Premise: (Issue was addressed) \u2192 (Issue was not addressed effectively)\n\n2. The conclusion states that if the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed. This can be represented as:\n   Conclusion: (Issue was addressed effectively) \u2192 (Issue was not addressed)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical validity of this argument.\n\nThe premise and the conclusion have different antecedents (the parts before the implication arrow), which are \"Issue was addressed\" and \"Issue was addressed effectively,\" respectively. However, the consequents (the parts after the implication arrow) are the same, which is \"Issue was not addressed (effectively).\"\n\nThis form of argument is known as the \"Fallacy of Denying the Antecedent.\" It is a logically invalid form of argument because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no"
