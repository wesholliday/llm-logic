The premise is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then not Q\", where P represents \"Alex exercised\" and Q represents \"Alex exercised much\".\n\n2. The conclusion is also a conditional statement, but it is in the form \"If Q, then not P\".\n\n3. This form of argument is known as the Converse Fallacy or the Fallacy of the Converse. It is a logical fallacy because the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true, even if the original conditional statement is true.\n\n4. In other words, just because the statement \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much\" is true, it does not necessarily follow that the statement \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise\" is also true.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"

The premise states that if Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much. This means that if the antecedent (Alex exercised) is true, the consequent (he did not exercise much) must also be true.\n\n2. The conclusion states that if Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise. This means that if the antecedent (Alex exercised much) is true, the consequent (he did not exercise) must also be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical validity of this argument.\n\nThe premise and the conclusion are related, but they are not logically equivalent. The premise suggests that if Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much, while the conclusion suggests that if Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise.\n\nThese two statements are not logically equivalent, as they are expressing different relationships between the concepts of \"exercising\" and \"exercising much.\"\n\nTherefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"

The conclusion suggests that if Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise.\n\nHowever, the premise does not necessarily imply the conclusion.
