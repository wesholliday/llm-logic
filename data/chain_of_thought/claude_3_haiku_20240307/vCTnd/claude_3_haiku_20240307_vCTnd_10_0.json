The premise states that if any advice was offered, then it was not helpful advice. This means that the presence of advice implies the absence of helpful advice.\n\n2. The conclusion states that if helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered. This is the contrapositive of the premise, which means that the conclusion is logically equivalent to the premise.\n\nSince the conclusion is logically equivalent to the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
