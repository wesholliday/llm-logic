This means that the premise is logically equivalent to: \"If the room was not tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied.\"\n\nThe conclusion, R \u2192 \u00acP, is the contrapositive of the premise, \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes"
