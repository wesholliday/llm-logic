This means that the premise is logically equivalent to \"If Ann did exercise strenuously, then she did not exercise.\"\n\nThe conclusion R \u2192 \u00acP is the same as the logically equivalent premise \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premise, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
