It is a logical fallacy because the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true, even if the original conditional statement is true.\n\nIn other words, just because the statement \"If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly\" is true, it does not necessarily follow that the statement \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given\" is also true.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
