            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park' from the given statement 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo', we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe given statement, 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo', is a conditional statement. It states that if one condition (Joe going to the park) is true, then the other condition (Lucy not going to the zoo) must also be true.\n\nTo infer the opposite statement, 'If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park', we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement and is formed by negating both the antecedent and the consequent.\n\nThe contrapositive of the given statement is: 'If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.'\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park' from the given statement 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
