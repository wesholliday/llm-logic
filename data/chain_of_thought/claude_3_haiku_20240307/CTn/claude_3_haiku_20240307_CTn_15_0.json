It can be expressed as:\n\nIf P, then not Q\n\nWhere P represents 'Sam took a plane' and Q represents 'Erin took a train'.\n\nTo infer the statement 'If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane', we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement and can be expressed as:\n\nIf not Q, then not P\n\nWhich translates to:\n\nIf Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\n\nThis is logically equivalent to the statement:\n\nIf Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane' from the given statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin did not take a train'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
