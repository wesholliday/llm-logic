The given statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then not Q\", where P represents \"Joe went to the park\" and Q represents \"Lucy went to the zoo\".\n2. To infer the statement \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\", we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement.\n3. The contrapositive of \"If P, then not Q\" is \"If Q, then not P\".\n4. Applying this to the given statement, the contrapositive would be: \"If Lucy went to the zoo (Q), then Joe did not go to the park (not P)\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
