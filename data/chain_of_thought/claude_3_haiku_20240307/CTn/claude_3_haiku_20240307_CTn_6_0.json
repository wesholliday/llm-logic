It can be expressed in the form of a logical implication: \"If P, then not Q\", where P represents 'Sue chose pizza' and Q represents 'Bob chose pasta'.\n\nTo determine if we can infer the desired statement 'If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza', we need to consider the logical contrapositive of the given statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of the statement \"If P, then not Q\" is \"If Q, then not P\".\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the given statement would be:\n\"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\".\n\nTherefore, we can infer the desired statement 'If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza' from the given statement 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
