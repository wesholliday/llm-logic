It can be expressed in the form \"If P, then not Q\", where P represents 'the vampire was awake' and Q represents 'the mummy was awake'.\n\nTo infer the statement 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake', we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then not Q\" is \"If Q, then not P\".\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be: \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake\".\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake' from the given statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was not awake'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
