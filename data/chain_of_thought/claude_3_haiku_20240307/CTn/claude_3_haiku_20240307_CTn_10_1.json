It suggests that if the dog was inside, then the cat was not outside. This statement does not directly imply the reverse statement, 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside'.\n\nHowever, we can use the logical principle of contraposition to infer the reverse statement. Contraposition states that if a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is true, then the statement \"If not B, then not A\" is also true.\n\nApplying contraposition to the given statement, we can infer: 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside.'\n\nAnswer: yes"
