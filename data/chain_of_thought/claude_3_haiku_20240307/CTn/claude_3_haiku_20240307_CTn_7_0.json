The contrapositive of 'If P, then not Q' is 'If Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be 'If Chris finished the race, then Alex did not finish the race'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If Chris finished the race, then Alex did not finish the race' from the given statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris did not finish the race'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
