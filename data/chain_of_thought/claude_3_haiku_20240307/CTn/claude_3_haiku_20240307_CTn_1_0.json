            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding' from the given statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe given statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding' is a conditional statement. It can be expressed in the form of a logical implication: \"If P, then not Q,\" where P represents 'Mary was at the wedding' and Q represents 'Sue was at the wedding'.\n\nTo infer the statement 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding', we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then not Q\" is \"If Q, then not P.\"\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be: \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding' from the given statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
