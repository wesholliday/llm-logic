This means that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer the converse of this statement, which is \"If B, then not A\". In other words, if the unicorn was in the forest, can we infer that the griffin was not in the forest?\n\nThe converse of a conditional statement is not always true, even if the original statement is true. However, in this case, we can infer the converse statement because of the logical relationship between the two events (the presence of the griffin and the unicorn in the forest).\n\nIf the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin could not have been in the forest, as the original statement states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest. This logical relationship holds true in both directions.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the statement \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\" from the given statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
