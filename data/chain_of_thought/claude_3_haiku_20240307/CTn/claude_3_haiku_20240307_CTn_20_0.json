The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the given statement would be 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red' from the given statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
