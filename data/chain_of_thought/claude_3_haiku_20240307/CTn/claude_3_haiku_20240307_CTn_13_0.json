            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If the truck was blue, then the car was not red' from the given statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was not blue', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe given statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was not blue' is a conditional statement. It can be expressed in the form of 'If P, then not Q', where P represents 'the car was red' and Q represents 'the truck was blue'.\n\nTo infer the statement 'If the truck was blue, then the car was not red', we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of 'If P, then not Q' is 'If Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be 'If the truck was blue, then the car was not red'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the truck was blue, then the car was not red' from the given statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was not blue'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
