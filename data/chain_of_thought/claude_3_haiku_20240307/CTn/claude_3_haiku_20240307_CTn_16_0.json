The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the given statement would be 'If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton' from the given statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
