The contrapositive of 'If P, then not Q' is 'If Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be 'If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball' from the given statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
