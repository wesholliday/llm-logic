In other words, the mummy being awake implies that the vampire was not awake.\n3) To infer \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake\", we need to flip the original statement.\n4) This is a valid inference, as the original statement is a conditional statement in the form \"if p, then not q\", which is logically equivalent to \"if q, then not p\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
