This means that if the bear was in the cave (A), then the wolf was not in the den (not B).\n\nTo infer the converse of this statement, we need to consider the logical relationship between the original statement and its converse.\n\nThe converse of the given statement would be \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave\".\n\nThe converse of a conditional statement is not always true, even if the original statement is true. However, in this case, the converse can be inferred because the given statement is a biconditional statement.\n\nA biconditional statement is of the form \"A if and only if B\", which means that A is true if and only if B is true. In this case, the statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den\" can be interpreted as a biconditional statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the converse statement \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
