It can be expressed in the form of 'If P, then not Q', where P represents 'the dog was inside' and Q represents 'the cat was outside'.\n\nTo infer the statement 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside', we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of 'If P, then not Q' is 'If Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside' from the given statement 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was not outside'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
