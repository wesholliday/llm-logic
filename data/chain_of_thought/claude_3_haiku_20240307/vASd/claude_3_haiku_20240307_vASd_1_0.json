The premise only has \"the match is struck\" as the antecedent, while the conclusion has \"the match is struck and it has been soaked in water\" as the antecedent.\n\nThe conclusion does not logically follow from the premise because the premise does not guarantee that a match that has been soaked in water will light when struck. The premise only states that a match that is struck will light, but it does not address the case where the match has been soaked in water.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
