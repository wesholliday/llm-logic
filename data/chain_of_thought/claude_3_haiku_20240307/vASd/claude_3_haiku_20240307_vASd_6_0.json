This additional condition does not change the consequence stated in the premise, which is that \"it will hurt my ears.\"\n\nEven if the person is wearing earplugs, the premise still holds true that if the person screams, it will hurt their ears. The additional condition in the conclusion does not affect the logical validity of the argument.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
