This means that the arrival of the package today is guaranteed if it has shipped, regardless of whether it was misrouted or not.\n\nThe conclusion, on the other hand, states that if the package has shipped (P) and it was misrouted (R), then it will still arrive today (Q).\n\nSince the premise already guarantees the arrival of the package today if it has shipped, the additional condition of the package being misrouted in the conclusion does not change the outcome. The conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
