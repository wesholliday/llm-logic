However, the conclusion introduces an additional condition, which is eating junk food. This means that the conclusion is making a stronger claim than the premise.\n\nIn other words, the premise only states that exercising is sufficient for losing weight, but the conclusion claims that exercising and eating junk food is also sufficient for losing weight. This is a logical fallacy known as the \"fallacy of affirming the consequent.\"\n\nThe logical form of the argument can be represented as:\nPremise: If P, then Q\nConclusion: If P and R, then Q\n\nThis form of argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no"
