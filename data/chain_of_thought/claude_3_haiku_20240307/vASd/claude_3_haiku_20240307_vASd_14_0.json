In other words, does the truth of the premise guarantee the truth of the conclusion?\n\nIn this case, the conclusion introduces an additional condition, \"and the test is in Chinese,\" which is not present in the premise. The premise only states that if you study hard, you will pass the test, but it does not specify the language of the test.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise. The fact that you study hard and pass the test does not imply that you will also pass the test if it is in Chinese.\n\nAnswer: no"
