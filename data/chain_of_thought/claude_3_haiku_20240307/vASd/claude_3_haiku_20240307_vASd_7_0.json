The premise has a simpler antecedent (\"the oven is on\"), while the conclusion has a more complex antecedent (\"the oven is on and the pilot light is out\").\n\nIn a logically valid argument, the conclusion must follow necessarily from the premise. However, in this case, the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premise. The premise only states that if the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm, but it does not say anything about the pilot light being out.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
