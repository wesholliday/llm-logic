In other words, does the premise \"If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm\" support the conclusion \"If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm\"?\n\nTo answer this, we can consider the following:\n- The premise only states that if the oven is on, the kitchen is warm. It does not mention anything about the pilot light.\n- The conclusion adds an additional condition, \"and the pilot light is out,\" which is not present in the premise.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.
