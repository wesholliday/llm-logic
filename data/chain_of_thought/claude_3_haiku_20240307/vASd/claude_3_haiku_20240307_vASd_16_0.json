The premise has a single antecedent, \"I fertilize the lawn,\" while the conclusion has two antecedents, \"I fertilize the lawn\" and \"there is a drought.\"\n\nThe conclusion does not logically follow from the premise. Just because the lawn will be lush and green if it is fertilized, it does not necessarily mean that it will be lush and green if it is fertilized and there is a drought. The presence of a drought could potentially affect the outcome, and the argument does not account for this.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
