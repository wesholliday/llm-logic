It is not a logically valid form of argument because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A. However, the conclusion adds an additional condition (the essay being turned in late) and claims that the student will still get an A. This is not a valid logical inference.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
