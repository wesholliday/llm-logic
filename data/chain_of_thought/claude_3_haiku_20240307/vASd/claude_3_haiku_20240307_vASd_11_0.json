            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nThe premise of the argument is: \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired.\"\nThe conclusion of the argument is: \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired.\"\n\nThe key question is whether the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In other words, does the truth of the premise guarantee the truth of the conclusion?\n\nThe premise states that if you get enough sleep, you won't be tired. However, the conclusion adds an additional condition, \"and do hard labor,\" which is not present in the premise.\n\nThe conclusion makes a stronger claim than the premise, as it suggests that even if you do hard labor, you won't be tired if you get enough sleep. This is not necessarily true, as doing hard labor can still lead to tiredness, even if you get enough sleep.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is not logically valid, as the conclusion does not follow logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no"
