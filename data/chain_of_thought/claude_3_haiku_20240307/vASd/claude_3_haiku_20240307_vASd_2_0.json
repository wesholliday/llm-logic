However, the conclusion states that even if both P and R are true, Q is still true.\n\nThis form of argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise. The premise only guarantees that if we go to the concert, we'll have a good time, but it does not guarantee that we'll have a good time if a bomb goes off, even if we go to the concert.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
