We are given the statement 'The flug was not zimmed'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the flug was blummed, then it was also zimmed.\n4. Since we know that the flug was not zimmed (from the first statement), we can infer that the condition in the second statement, 'the flug was blummed', must be false.\n5.
