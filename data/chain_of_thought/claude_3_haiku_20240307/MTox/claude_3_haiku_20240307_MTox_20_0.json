The first statement tells us that \"The fleeg did not surn\". This means that the fleeg did not surn.\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\". This means that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n3. Now, we can use the first statement to infer that the fleeg did not surn. This means that the condition in the second statement, \"the fleeg was bluttered\", must be false. Otherwise, the fleeg would have surned, which contradicts the first statement.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"The fleeg was not bluttered\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
