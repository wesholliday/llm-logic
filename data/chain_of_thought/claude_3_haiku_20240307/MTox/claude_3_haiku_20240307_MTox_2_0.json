We are given the statement 'The wug did not bim the zoint'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\n4. The first statement tells us that the wug did not bim the zoint.\n5. If the wug did not bim the zoint, and the second statement tells us that if the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint, then we can infer that the wug was not flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes"
