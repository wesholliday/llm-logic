This means that the dreb was not spened.\n4) Now, the second premise is \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\". This is a conditional statement, which means that if the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\n5) Since we know from the first premise that the dreb was not spened, we can infer that the dreb was also not vroombed. This is because if the dreb was vroombed, then it would have been spened, but we know that it was not spened.\n\nAnswer: yes"
