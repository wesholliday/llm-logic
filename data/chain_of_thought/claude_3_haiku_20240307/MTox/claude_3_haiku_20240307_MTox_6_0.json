We are given the statement 'The grommet did not plop the frink'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\n4. However, the first statement tells us that the grommet did not plop the frink.\n5. Therefore, if the grommet did not plop the frink, then the condition in the second statement must be false, which means that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
