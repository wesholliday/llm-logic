We are given the statement 'The whiffle did not tink'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\n4. However, the first statement tells us that the whiffle did not tink.\n5. Therefore, if the whiffle did not tink, then it must not have been shanked, since the second statement says that if the whiffle was shanked, then it would have tinked.\n6. So, from the given information, we can infer that 'The whiffle was not shanked'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
