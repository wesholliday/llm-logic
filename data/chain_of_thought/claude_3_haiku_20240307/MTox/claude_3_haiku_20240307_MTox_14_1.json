The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\n4. The negation of the first statement is 'The clug did not snugged'.

We are given two premises:\n   a. \"The clug did not snugged\"\n   b. \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\"\n\n2. The second premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\n\n3. From the first premise, we know that the clug did not snugged.\n\n4. Using the second premise, we can reason that if the clug did not snugged, then it must not have been fleeked. This is because the second premise states that if the clug was fleeked, then it would have snugged, but since it did not snugged, it must not have been fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
