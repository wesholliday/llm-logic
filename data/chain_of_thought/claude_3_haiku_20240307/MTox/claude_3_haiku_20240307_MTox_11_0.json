We are given the statement 'The flug was not zimmed'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed'.\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that if the flug was not zimmed, then it was also not blummed.\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the flug was not zimmed, we can infer that the flug was also not blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
