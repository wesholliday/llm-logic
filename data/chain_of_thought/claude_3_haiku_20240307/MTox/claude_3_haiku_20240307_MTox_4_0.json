We are given the statement 'The fribble did not crink'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\n4. However, the first statement tells us that the fribble did not crink.\n5. Therefore, if the fribble did not crink, then the fribble must not have been snurgled, since the second statement tells us that if the fribble was snurgled, then it would have crinked.\n6. So, we can infer that 'The fribble was not snurgled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
