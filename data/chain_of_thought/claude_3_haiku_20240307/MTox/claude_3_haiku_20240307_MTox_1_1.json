'If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled'\n\nTo infer 'The flugel was not blimmed', we need to follow the logical reasoning.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be written as: \"If P, then Q\". In this case, P is \"the flugel was blimmed\" and Q is \"the flugel was zargled\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that \"the flugel was not zargled\". This means that the consequent (Q) of the conditional statement is false.\n\nAccording to the logical principle of the contrapositive, if the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The flugel was not blimmed'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
