This means that the smip did not perform the action of lupping the zoint.\n\n2. The second statement is \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint\". This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the smip was shripped) is true, then the consequence (the smip lupped the zoint) is also true.\n\n3. The question is asking whether we can infer \"The smip was not shripped\" from the given information.\n\n4. If the smip did not lup the zoint (first statement), and the second statement tells us that if the smip was shripped, then it would have lupped the zoint, then we can infer that the smip was not shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes"
