We are given the statement 'The flob did not movated'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\n4. However, the first statement tells us that the flob did not movate.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the flob was not skizzled, because if the flob was skizzled, then it would have movated, but we know that it did not movate.\n\nAnswer: yes"
