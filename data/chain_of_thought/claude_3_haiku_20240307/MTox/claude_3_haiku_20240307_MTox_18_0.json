This means that the condition Q in the second statement is not true.\n\nStep 3: Apply logical reasoning.\nIf the condition Q in the second statement is not true, then the antecedent P must also be false. This is because the second statement is a conditional statement, and if the consequent is false, the antecedent must also be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The shank was not plooked\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
