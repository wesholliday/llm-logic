We are given the statement 'The splat did not quank'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\n4. Since the first statement says that the splat did not quank, this means that the condition in the second statement (the splat was morphed) must be false.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that 'The splat was not morphed'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
