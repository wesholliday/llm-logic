We are given the following two statements:\n   - \"The smip did not lup the zoint\"\n   - \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint\"\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the smip was shripped) is true, then the consequent (the smip lupped the zoint) is also true.\n\n3. The first statement tells us that the smip did not lup the zoint. This means that the consequent of the conditional statement is false.\n\n4. If the consequent of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent must also be false. This is known as the contrapositive of the conditional statement.\n\n5. Therefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The smip was not shripped\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
