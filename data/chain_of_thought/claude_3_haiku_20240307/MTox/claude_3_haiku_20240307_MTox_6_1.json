            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to use logical reasoning and the information provided in the given statements.\n\nThe first statement, \"The grommet did not plop the frink,\" tells us that the grommet did not perform the action of plopping the frink.\n\nThe second statement, \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink,\" is a conditional statement. It says that if the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical inference we can make from these two statements.\n\nIf the grommet did not plop the frink (the first statement), and the second statement says that if the grommet was sploffed, then it plopped the frink, then we can logically conclude that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
