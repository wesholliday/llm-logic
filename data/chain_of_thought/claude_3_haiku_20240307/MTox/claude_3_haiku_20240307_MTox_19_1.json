This is because the statement says \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\", which is logically equivalent to saying \"If the smonk did not plagg, then the smonk was not vreebled\".\n\n3) Since we are given in statement (a) that \"The smonk did not plagged\", we can infer from the previous step that \"The smonk was not vreebled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
