We are given the statement 'The wug was not garpled'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the wug was sproinged, then it was also garpled.\n4. If the wug was not garpled (first statement), then it must not have been sproinged, as the second statement implies that a sproinged wug would have been garpled.\n5.
