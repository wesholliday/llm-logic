The first premise is 'The whiffle did not tink'. This means that the whiffle did not make a tinked sound.\n\n2. The second premise is 'If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the whiffle was shanked, then it would have tinked.\n\n3. Now, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two premises. If the whiffle did not tink (the first premise), and the second premise states that if the whiffle was shanked, then it would have tinked, then we can infer that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
