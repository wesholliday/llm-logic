We are also given the statement: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that the robot did not necessarily visit Jupiter.\n4. From the second statement, we can infer that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n5. If the robot did not necessarily visit Jupiter, then the condition in the second statement (that the alien visited Mars) must not be true.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes"
