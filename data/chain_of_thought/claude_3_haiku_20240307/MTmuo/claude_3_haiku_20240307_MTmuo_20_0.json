            "content": "To answer this question, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\" This means that it is not necessary for the banana to have been yellow.\n\n2. The second premise is \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n\n3. The question is asking whether we can infer \"The apple was not red\" from these two premises.\n\nTo answer this, we need to consider the contrapositive of the second premise. The contrapositive of \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" is \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\"\n\n4. Since the first premise tells us that \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow,\" this means that the banana was not necessarily yellow. Therefore, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
