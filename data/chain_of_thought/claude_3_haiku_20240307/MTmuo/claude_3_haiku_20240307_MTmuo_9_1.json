This means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\n3. The question asks whether we can infer from these two statements that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\".\n\n4. If we assume that Lisa bought the red shirt, then the second statement tells us that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. But the first statement tells us that it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This creates a contradiction.\n\n5. Therefore, the only way to resolve this contradiction is to conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
