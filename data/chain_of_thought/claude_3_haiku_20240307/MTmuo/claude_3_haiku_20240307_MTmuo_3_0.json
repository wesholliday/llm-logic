We are given the statement: \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\"\n   This means that the book is not necessarily a mystery novel.\n\n2. We are also given the statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\"\n   This means that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the two statements together.\n   If the book is not necessarily a mystery novel (from the first statement), but if it was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel (from the second statement), then we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
