This means that it is not necessary for Bob to have chosen pasta.\n\n2. The second statement is \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\". This means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer that \"Sue did not choose pizza\" from these two statements.\n\n4. If it's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta (first statement), then it's possible that Bob did not choose pasta. This means that the condition in the second statement (\"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\") may not be satisfied.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"Sue did not choose pizza\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
