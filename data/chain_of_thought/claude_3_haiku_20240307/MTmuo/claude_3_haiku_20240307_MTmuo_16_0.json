            "content": "To answer this question, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. The first statement is \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\" This means that the pants were not necessarily denim.\n\n2. The second statement is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\" This means that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n\n3. Now, we need to consider the relationship between these two statements. The first statement tells us that the pants were not necessarily denim, while the second statement tells us that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\n\n4. If the pants were not necessarily denim, then the second statement cannot be true. In other words, if the pants were not denim, then the shirt could not have been cotton.\n\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes"
