The first premise is \"It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\" This means that it is possible that Chris did not finish the race.\n\n2. The second premise is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\" This means that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have also finished the race.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the implications of these two premises together. If it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race (first premise), and if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race (second premise), then it must be the case that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that \"Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
