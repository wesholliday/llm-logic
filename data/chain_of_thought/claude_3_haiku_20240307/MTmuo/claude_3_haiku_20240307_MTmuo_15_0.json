This means that it is not necessary for Erin to have taken a train.\n\n2) The second statement is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train\". This means that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n\n3) Now, we are asked if we can infer from these two statements that \"Sam did not take a plane\".\n\n4) If we assume that Sam did take a plane, then the second statement tells us that Erin must have taken a train. However, the first statement tells us that it is not necessary for Erin to have taken a train.\n\n5) This contradiction means that our initial assumption that Sam took a plane must be incorrect. Therefore, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes"
