The first premise tells us that it's not necessary for the truck to have been metal. This means that the truck could have been made of a material other than metal.\n2. The second premise tells us that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. This means that if the doll was not plastic, then the truck would not have to be metal.\n3. Combining these two premises, we can conclude that if the doll was not plastic, then the truck would not have to be metal. This is the same as saying that the doll was not plastic.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes"
