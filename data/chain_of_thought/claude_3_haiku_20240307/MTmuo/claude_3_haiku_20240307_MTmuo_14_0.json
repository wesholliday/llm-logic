We are also given the statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\"\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that if the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\n4. This is because the second statement says that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear could not have been in the cave.\n5. Therefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
