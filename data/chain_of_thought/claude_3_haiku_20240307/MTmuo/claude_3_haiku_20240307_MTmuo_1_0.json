The first premise is \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This means that it is not necessary for Sue to have been at the wedding.\n\n2. The second premise is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have also been at the wedding.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the two premises together. If it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding, and if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding, then we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes"
