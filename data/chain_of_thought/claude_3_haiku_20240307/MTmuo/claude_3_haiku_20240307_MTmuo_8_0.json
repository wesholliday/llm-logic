We are given the statement: \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\"\n   This means that it is not necessary for the mummy to have been awake.\n\n2. We are also given the statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\"\n   This means that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have also been awake.\n\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer that \"The vampire was not awake\" from the given information.\n\nReasoning:\n- If the mummy must have been awake when the vampire was awake (second statement), and it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake (first statement), then it follows that the vampire must not have been awake.\n\nAnswer: yes"
