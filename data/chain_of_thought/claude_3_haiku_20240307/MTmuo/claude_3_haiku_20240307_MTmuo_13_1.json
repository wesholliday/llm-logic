We are given the statement: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\" This means that it's not necessarily true that the truck was blue.\n\n2. We are also given the statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" This means that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\n\n3. From these two statements, we need to determine if we can infer that \"The car was not red.\"\n\nTo do this, we can use the principle of contraposition. If \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\" is true, then the contrapositive \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\" must also be true.\n\n4. Since we know that \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue,\" this means that the truck was not necessarily blue.

The question is whether we can infer from these two statements that \"The car was not red\".\n\nTo determine this, we need to consider the implications of the conditional statement. If the truck must have been blue if the car was red, then the inverse of this statement is also true: if the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\n\nSince the first statement tells us that it's not the case that the truck must have been blue, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
