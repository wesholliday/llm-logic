            "content": "To answer this question, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given the statement: \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\"\n   This means that it is not necessary for the unicorn to have been in the forest.\n\n2. We are also given the statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\"\n   This means that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have also been in the forest.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the contrapositive of the second statement: \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\"\n   This is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. Since we know from the first statement that \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest,\" we can infer that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\n5. Therefore, by the contrapositive of the second statement, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes"
