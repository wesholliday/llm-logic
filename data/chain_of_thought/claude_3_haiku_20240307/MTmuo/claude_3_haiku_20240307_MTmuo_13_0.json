            "content": "To answer this question, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. The first statement is \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\" This means that it is not necessary for the truck to have been blue.\n\n2. The second statement is \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\n\n3. The question is asking whether we can infer from these two statements that \"The car was not red.\"\n\nTo determine this, we need to consider the logical implications of the given statements.\n\nIf the first statement is true (it's not the case that the truck must have been blue), then it means that the truck could have been a color other than blue. This means that the second statement (if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue) cannot be true, because the truck was not necessarily blue.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
