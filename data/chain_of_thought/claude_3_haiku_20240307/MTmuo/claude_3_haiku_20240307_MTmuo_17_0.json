The first statement is \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad.\" This means that it is not necessary for Kate to have eaten salad.\n\n2. The second statement is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\" This means that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the contrapositive of the second statement: \"If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\" This is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. Since we know from the first statement that \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad,\" we can infer that Kate did not eat salad.\n\n5. Applying the contrapositive of the second statement, we can then infer that \"Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
