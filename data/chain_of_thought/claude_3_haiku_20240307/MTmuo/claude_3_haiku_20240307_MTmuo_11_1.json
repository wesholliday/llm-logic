However, since the first statement tells us that \"it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry\", this means that the consequent of the conditional statement is false.\n5. If the consequent is false, then the antecedent (the cake was chocolate) must also be false, according to the principle of the contrapositive.\n6.
