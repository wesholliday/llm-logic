            "content": "To answer this question, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball\". This means that it is not necessary for Jen to have watched basketball.\n\n2. The second premise is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\". This means that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n\n3. The question is asking whether we can infer from these two premises that \"Tom did not watch football\".\n\nTo answer this, we need to consider the contrapositive of the second premise, which is \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\".\n\nSince the first premise tells us that \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball\", this means that Jen did not necessarily watch basketball.\n\nTherefore, we can infer from the two premises that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes"
