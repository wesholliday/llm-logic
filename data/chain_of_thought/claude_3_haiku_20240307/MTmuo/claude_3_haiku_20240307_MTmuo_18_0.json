            "content": "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We are given the statement: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\"\n   This means that it is not necessarily true that the truck was metal.\n\n2. We are also given the statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\"\n   This means that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer that \"The doll was not plastic\" from the given information.\n\nTo do this, we can use the principle of contraposition. The contrapositive of the statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" is \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\"\n\nSince we know that \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal,\" we can infer that the truck was not metal. Therefore, by the contrapositive, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes"
