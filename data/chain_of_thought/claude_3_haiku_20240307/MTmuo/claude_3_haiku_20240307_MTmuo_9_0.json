This means that it is not necessary that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n2) The second statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\". This means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\n3) Now, we are asked if we can infer from these two statements that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\".\n\n4) If we assume that Lisa did buy the red shirt, then the second statement tells us that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. \n\n5) However, the first statement tells us that it is not necessary that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n6) Therefore, the two statements are contradictory, and we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no"
