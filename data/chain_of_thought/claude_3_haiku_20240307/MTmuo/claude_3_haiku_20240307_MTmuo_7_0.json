We are given the statement: \"It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\"\n   This means that it is not necessary for Chris to have finished the race.\n\n2. We are also given the statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\"\n   This means that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have also finished the race.\n\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer that \"Alex did not finish the race.\"\n   If Alex had finished the race, then according to the second statement, Chris must have also finished the race.\n   However, the first statement tells us that it is not necessary for Chris to have finished the race.\n   This means that if Alex had finished the race, then Chris must have also finished the race, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nTherefore, the only way to resolve this contradiction is to conclude that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes"
