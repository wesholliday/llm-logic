            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\nPremise 2: The truck was metal.\nConclusion: The doll was plastic.\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we can use the rules of propositional logic.\n\nThe first premise, \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal,\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the antecedent (the doll was plastic) is true, then the consequent (the truck was metal) must also be true.\n\nThe second premise, \"The truck was metal,\" affirms the consequent of the first premise.\n\nHowever, the conclusion, \"The doll was plastic,\" does not necessarily follow from the given premises. The fact that the truck was metal does not imply that the doll was plastic. There could be other possible scenarios where the truck was metal, but the doll was not plastic.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
