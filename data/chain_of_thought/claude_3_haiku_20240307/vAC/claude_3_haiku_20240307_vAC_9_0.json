It is a logically invalid form of argument because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nThe reason is that even if the first premise is true (if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt), and the second premise is true (Mark bought the blue shirt), it does not necessarily mean that the conclusion is true (Lisa bought the red shirt). There could be other possible scenarios where Mark bought the blue shirt, but Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
