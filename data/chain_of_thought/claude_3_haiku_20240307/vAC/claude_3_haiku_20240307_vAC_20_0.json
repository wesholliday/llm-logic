Even if the second premise is true (the banana was yellow), it does not mean that the first premise is true (the apple was red). The first premise only states that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow, but it does not imply the converse, that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
