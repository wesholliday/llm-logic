It is not a logically valid form of argument because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nThe reason is that the first premise, \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo,\" does not imply the converse, \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park.\" There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo, and Joe's going to the park may not be the only possible reason.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
