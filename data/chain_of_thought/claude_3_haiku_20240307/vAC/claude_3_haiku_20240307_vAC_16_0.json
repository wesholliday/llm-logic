It is a logically invalid form of argument because the truth of the conclusion (the shirt was cotton) does not necessarily follow from the truth of the premises.\n\nThe reason is that the first premise, \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,\" does not imply the converse, \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton.\" There could be other reasons why the pants were denim, and the shirt may or may not have been cotton.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
