It is a logically invalid form of argument because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nThe reason is that the first premise, \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue,\" does not imply the converse, \"If the truck was blue, then the car was red.\" There could be other reasons why the truck was blue, and the car may not have been red.\n\nIn other words, the fact that the truck was blue does not necessarily mean that the car was red. The conclusion does not follow logically from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
