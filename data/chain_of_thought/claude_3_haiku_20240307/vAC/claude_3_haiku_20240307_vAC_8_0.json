It is a logically invalid form of argument because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nThe reason is that the first premise only tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. However, the second premise tells us that the mummy was awake, but this does not necessarily imply that the vampire was also awake. There could be other reasons why the mummy was awake, and the vampire may or may not have been awake.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
