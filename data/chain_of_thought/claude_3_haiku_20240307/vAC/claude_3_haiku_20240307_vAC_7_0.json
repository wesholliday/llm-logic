It is a logically invalid form of argument because the truth of the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the truth of the premises.\n\nThe reason is that the first premise, \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race,\" does not imply the converse, \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race.\" In other words, the fact that Chris finished the race does not necessarily mean that Alex also finished the race.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
