            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\nPremise 2: Sue was at the wedding.\nConclusion: Mary was at the wedding.\n\nThis form of argument is known as the \"Affirming the Consequent\" fallacy. It is a logically invalid form of argument because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nThe reason is that the first premise, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" does not imply the converse, \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\" In other words, the fact that Sue was at the wedding does not necessarily mean that Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
