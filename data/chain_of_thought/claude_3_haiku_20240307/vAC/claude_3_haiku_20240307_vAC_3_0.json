It is a logically invalid form of argument because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nThe reason is that even if the first premise is true (if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel) and the second premise is true (the book is a mystery novel), it does not necessarily mean that the book was written by James. There could be other authors who have written mystery novels as well.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
