In other words, the plinked condition is sufficient for the twonk to be varnished.\n\nThe second statement is: 'The twonk was not varnished.'\nThis statement directly contradicts the conclusion of the first statement, which is that the twonk was varnished.\n\nSince the twonk was not varnished, and the first statement indicates that the twonk being plinked is sufficient for it to be varnished, we can conclude that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
