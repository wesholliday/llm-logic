The first statement is: \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"The twonk was not varnished.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n- If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished (from the first statement).\n- However, the second statement tells us that the twonk was not varnished.\n- Therefore, the twonk could not have been plinked, as that would have led to the twonk being varnished, which is contradictory to the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
