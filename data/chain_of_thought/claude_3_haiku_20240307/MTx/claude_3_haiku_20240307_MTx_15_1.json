The first statement is \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The dreb was not spened.\" This means that the dreb was not spened.\n\n3. Now, we need to consider the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive is \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\" This is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. Since we know from the second statement that \"The dreb was not spened,\" we can apply the contrapositive to conclude that \"The dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"

However, the statement does not imply the reverse, that if the dreb was spened, then the dreb was vroombed.\n\nStep 2: Consider the second statement, \"The dreb was not spened.\"\nThis statement contradicts the conclusion of the first statement, which says that if the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\n\nStep 3: Infer the conclusion.\nSince the dreb was not spened, and the first statement says that if the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened, we can infer that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
