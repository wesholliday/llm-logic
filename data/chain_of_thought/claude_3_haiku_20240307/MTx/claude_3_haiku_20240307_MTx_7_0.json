This means that if the whiffle was shanked, then it must have tinked.\n2. The second premise is \"The whiffle did not tink\". This means that the whiffle did not tink.\n3. Now, we need to consider the logical implications of these two premises.\n4. If the whiffle was shanked, then it must have tinked (from the first premise).\n5. However, the second premise tells us that the whiffle did not tink.\n6. Therefore, the whiffle could not have been shanked, because if it was shanked, it would have tinked, but it did not tink.\n7. So, we can infer that \"The whiffle was not shanked\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
