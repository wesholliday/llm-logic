The first statement is: 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.'\n   This is a conditional statement, which means that if the flug was blummed, then it must have also been zimmed.\n\n2. The second statement is: 'The flug was not zimmed.'\n   This contradicts the conclusion of the first statement, which says that if the flug was blummed, then it was zimmed.\n\n3. Since the flug was not zimmed, then the first part of the conditional statement must be false. In other words, the flug was not blummed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The flug was not blummed.'\n\nAnswer: yes"
