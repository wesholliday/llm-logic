The whiffle did not tink.\n\nTo infer 'The whiffle was not shanked', we need to use the principles of logical reasoning.\n\nStep 1: Understand the given information.\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked. The second statement tells us that the whiffle did not tink.\n\nStep 2: Apply logical reasoning.\nIf the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked (according to the first statement). However, the second statement tells us that the whiffle did not tink. This means that the antecedent of the conditional statement, \"the whiffle was shanked,\" must be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The whiffle was not shanked'.\n\nAnswer: yes"

The question is asking whether we can infer from these two statements that \"The whiffle was not shanked\".\n\nTo answer this, we need to look at the logical structure of the first statement. It is an 'if-then' statement, which means that if the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the whiffle did not tink. This means that the 'then' part of the first statement is false.\n\nIf the 'then' part of an 'if-then' statement is false, then the 'if' part must also be false. \n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The whiffle was not shanked\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
