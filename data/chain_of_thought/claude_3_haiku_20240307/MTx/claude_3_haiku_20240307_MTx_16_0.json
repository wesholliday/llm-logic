The second statement is: \"The sneg did not sproted the frink.\"\n3. We need to determine if we can infer from these two statements that \"The sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nThe first statement tells us that if the sneg was crampled, then it sproted the frink. The second statement tells us that the sneg did not sprote the frink.\n\nIf the sneg did not sprote the frink, then it must not have been crampled, according to the first statement. This is because the first statement says that if the sneg was crampled, then it would have sproted the frink.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
