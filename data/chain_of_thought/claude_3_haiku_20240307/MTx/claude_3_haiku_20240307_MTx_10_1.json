This can be represented as: \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the wug was sproinged\" and Q is \"the wug was garpled\".\n\nStep 2: Use the second premise to negate the consequent of the conditional statement.\nThe second premise states that \"The wug was not garpled.\" This means that the consequent Q is false, i.e., the wug was not garpled.\n\nStep 3: Apply the logical rule of modus tollens.\nThe modus tollens rule states that if the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is true and the consequent Q is false, then the antecedent P must also be false.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that \"The wug was not sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
