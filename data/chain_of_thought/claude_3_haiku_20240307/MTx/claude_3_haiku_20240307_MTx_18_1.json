The second statement is \"The shank was not nugged.\"\n3. We want to determine if we can infer \"The shank was not plooked\" from these two statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the shank was plooked, then it was also nugged. However, the second statement tells us that the shank was not nugged.\n\nIf the shank was not nugged, then it could not have been plooked, according to the first statement. This means that we can infer \"The shank was not plooked\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
