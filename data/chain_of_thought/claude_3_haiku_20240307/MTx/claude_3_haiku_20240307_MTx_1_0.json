This means that if the flugel was blimmed, then it must have also been zargled.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The flugel was not zargled\". This means that the flugel was not zargled.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the first statement again. If the flugel was not zargled, then it could not have been blimmed either, because the first statement says that if the flugel was blimmed, then it must have also been zargled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flugel was not blimmed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
