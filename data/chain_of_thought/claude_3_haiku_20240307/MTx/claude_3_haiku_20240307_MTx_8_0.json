The first statement is \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the sprocket was cranked, then it was also daggled.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The sprocket was not daggled.\" This is the negation of the consequent in the first statement.\n\n3. Using the rules of logical inference, if the consequent (the sprocket was daggled) is false, then the antecedent (the sprocket was cranked) must also be false.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
