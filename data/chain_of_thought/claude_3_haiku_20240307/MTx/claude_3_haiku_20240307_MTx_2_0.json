The first statement is \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The wug did not bim the zoint.\" This is a negation of the consequent in the first statement.\n\n3. When we have a conditional statement and the negation of the consequent, we can infer the negation of the antecedent. In other words, if the wug did not bim the zoint, then we can infer that the wug was not flooped.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer 'The wug was not flooped.'\n\nAnswer: yes"
