We are also given the statement \"The glip was not tragged.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the glip was not tragged, then it was also not slogged. This is because the first statement says that if the glip was slogged, then it was tragged.\n4. Since we know from the second statement that the glip was not tragged, we can infer that the glip was also not slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
