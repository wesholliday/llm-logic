The first statement is: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\"\n   This statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the wug was sproinged, then it was also garpled.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The wug was not garpled.\"\n   This statement contradicts the conclusion of the conditional statement in the first statement.\n\n3. If the wug was not garpled, then it cannot have been sproinged, as the first statement indicates that if the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The wug was not sproinged' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
