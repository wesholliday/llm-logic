We are given the following two statements:\n   - If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\n   - The splat did not quank.\n\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank. This is because the statement is an implication, and the contrapositive of \"if A, then B\" is \"if not B, then not A\".\n\n3. Now, we have the second statement, which says that the splat did not quank.\n\n4. Combining the two statements, we can infer that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
