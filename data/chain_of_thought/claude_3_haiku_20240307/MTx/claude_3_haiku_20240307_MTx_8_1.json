We have the premise 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled'.\n2. We also have the premise 'The sprocket was not daggled'.\n3. We want to determine if we can infer 'The sprocket was not cranked' from these two premises.\n\nThe first premise, 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled', is a conditional statement. This means that if the sprocket was cranked, then it was necessarily daggled. However, the converse is not necessarily true \u2013 just because the sprocket was daggled, it does not mean it was cranked.\n\nThe second premise, 'The sprocket was not daggled', contradicts the first premise. If the sprocket was not daggled, then it could not have been cranked, since the first premise states that if the sprocket was cranked, then it was daggled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The sprocket was not cranked' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
