The first premise is 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged'.\n2. The second premise is 'The clug did not snugged'.\n3. The question is asking whether we can infer 'The clug was not fleeked' from these two premises.\n\nThe key to answering this is to use the principle of contraposition. The first premise, 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged', is logically equivalent to 'If the clug did not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked'.\n\nSince the second premise is 'The clug did not snugged', we can apply the contraposition to infer 'The clug was not fleeked'.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer 'The clug was not fleeked'.\n\nAnswer: yes"

This means that the conditional statement must be false, as the consequent is false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The clug was not fleeked\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
