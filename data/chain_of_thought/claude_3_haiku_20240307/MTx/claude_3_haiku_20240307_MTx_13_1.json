We want to determine if we can infer: \"The glip was not slogged.\"\n\nThe first premise tells us that if the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.

This contradicts the first premise, which states that if the glip was slogged, it must have been tragged.\n\nSince the glip was not tragged, and if the glip was slogged it must have been tragged, we can infer that the glip was not slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
