We are given the statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\"\n2. We are also given the statement \"The zinger was not smoogled.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the zinger was not smoogled, then it was also not fraggled.\n4. Since we know from the second statement that the zinger was not smoogled, we can infer that the zinger was also not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
