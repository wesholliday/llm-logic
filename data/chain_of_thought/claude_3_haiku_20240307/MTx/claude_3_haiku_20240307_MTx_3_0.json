The second statement is \"The splat did not quank\".\n3. We want to determine if we can infer \"The splat was not morphed\" from these two statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the splat was morphed) is true, then the consequent (the splat quanked) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the consequent (the splat quanked) is not true.\n\nUsing the principle of modus tollens, we can infer that the antecedent (the splat was morphed) must also be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The splat was not morphed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
