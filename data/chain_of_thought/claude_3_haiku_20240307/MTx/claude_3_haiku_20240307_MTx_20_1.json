In other words, bluttering the fleeg is a sufficient condition for the fleeg to surn.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement, \"The fleeg did not surn\".\nThis means that the fleeg did not surn, which contradicts the conclusion of the first statement.\n\nStep 3: Use the rules of logical reasoning to make the inference.\nIf the fleeg did not surn, and the first statement says that bluttering the fleeg is a sufficient condition for the fleeg to surn, then we can infer that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes"
