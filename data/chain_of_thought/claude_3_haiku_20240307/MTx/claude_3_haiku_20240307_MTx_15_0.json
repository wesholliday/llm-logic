We are also given the statement: \"The dreb was not spened.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the dreb was not spened, then it was also not vroombed.\n4. This is because the first statement says that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was spened. The contrapositive of this statement is that if the dreb was not spened, then it was not vroombed.\n5. Since we are given that the dreb was not spened, we can infer that the dreb was also not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
