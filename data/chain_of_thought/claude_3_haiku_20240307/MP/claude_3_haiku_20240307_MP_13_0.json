The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This means that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. It does not necessarily mean that if the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"The car was red.\" This means that the condition in the first statement is true.\n\n3. Since the condition in the first statement is true (the car was red), we can infer that the conclusion in the first statement is also true (the truck was blue).\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that 'The truck was blue'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
