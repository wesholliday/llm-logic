We are given the statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n2. We are also given the statement: \"The vampire was awake.\"\n3. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake.\n4. Since we know that the vampire was awake (from the second statement), we can apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement and the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that \"The mummy was awake.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
