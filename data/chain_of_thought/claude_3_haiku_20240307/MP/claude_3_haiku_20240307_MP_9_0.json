            "content": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the logical structure of the given statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This statement can be represented as:\n\nIf P, then Q\n\nWhere P represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement: \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\" This statement affirms the antecedent (P) of the conditional statement.\n\nNow, we can apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then we can infer the consequent (Q) is also true.\n\nIn this case, since we have the conditional statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" and we know that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true, we can infer that \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
