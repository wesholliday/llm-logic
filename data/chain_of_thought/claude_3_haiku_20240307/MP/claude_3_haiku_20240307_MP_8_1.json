The given premise is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"the vampire was awake\" and the consequent is \"the mummy was awake.\"\n4.

The second statement is a categorical statement: \"The vampire was awake.\" This means that the vampire was indeed awake.\n\n3. Since the first statement is a conditional statement, and the second statement tells us that the condition (the vampire being awake) is true, we can apply the rule of modus ponens.
