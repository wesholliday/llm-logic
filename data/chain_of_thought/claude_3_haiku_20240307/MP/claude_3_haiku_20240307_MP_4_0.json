The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\" This means that if the alien visited Mars, then it necessarily follows that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"The alien visited Mars.\" This means that the condition in the first statement is true.\n\n3. Since the condition in the first statement is true (the alien visited Mars), and the first statement is a conditional statement, we can infer that the conclusion of the first statement is also true. In other words, we can infer that \"The robot visited Jupiter.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
