This means that if the dog was inside, then it necessarily follows that the cat was outside. However, this statement does not imply the converse, which would be \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside.\"\n\nThe second premise, \"The dog was inside,\" is a statement of fact that confirms the antecedent of the first premise.\n\nGiven these two premises, we can apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that \"The cat was outside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
