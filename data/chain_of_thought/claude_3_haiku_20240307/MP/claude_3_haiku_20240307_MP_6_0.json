It means that if the antecedent (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the consequent (Bob chose pasta) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement, \"Sue chose pizza,\" provides the truth of the antecedent in the first statement.\n\nNow, we can apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if the antecedent of a conditional statement is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nSince the antecedent \"Sue chose pizza\" is true, and the conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is true, we can infer that the consequent \"Bob chose pasta\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
