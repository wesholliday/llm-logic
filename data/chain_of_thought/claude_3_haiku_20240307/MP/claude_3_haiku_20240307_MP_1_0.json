The first statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequent (Sue was at the wedding) is also true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Mary was at the wedding.\" This is the antecedent of the conditional statement.\n\n3. Since the antecedent is true, we can apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that 'Sue was at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
