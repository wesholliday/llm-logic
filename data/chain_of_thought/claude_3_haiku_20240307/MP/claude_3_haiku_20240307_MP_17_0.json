The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\" This means that if the condition \"Ben ate pasta\" is true, then the conclusion \"Kate ate the salad\" must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Ben ate pasta.\" This means that the condition in the first statement is true.\n\n3. Since the condition \"Ben ate pasta\" is true, and the first statement is a conditional statement, we can infer that the conclusion \"Kate ate the salad\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
