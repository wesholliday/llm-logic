The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This means that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n2. The second statement tells us that \"The doll was plastic.\" This is the antecedent (the 'if' part) of the conditional statement.\n3. In a valid deductive argument, if the antecedent of a conditional statement is true, then the consequent (the 'then' part) must also be true.\n4.

            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'The truck was metal' from the given information, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement, \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal,\" is a conditional statement. It means that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This statement can be written in symbolic logic as:\n\nIf P, then Q\n\nwhere P represents \"the doll was plastic\" and Q represents \"the truck was metal.\"\n\nThe second statement, \"The doll was plastic,\" is a simple declarative statement that affirms the antecedent (P) of the conditional statement.\n\nNow, to determine if we can infer \"The truck was metal\" from these two statements, we need to apply the rules of inference in propositional logic. Specifically, we can use the rule of modus ponens, which states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"P,\" then we can infer \"Q.\"\n\nIn this case, we have \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" and \"The doll was plastic.\" Therefore, we can infer \"The truck was metal.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"

This is a logical implication, not a biconditional statement, so it doesn't necessarily mean that if the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the doll was plastic. Since the first statement is a conditional, we can use the \"modus ponens\" rule of inference, which states that if P is true and if P implies Q, then Q is also true.\n\nIn this case, P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal\". Since P is true (the doll was plastic), and the first statement implies that P implies Q, we can infer that Q is also true (the truck was metal).\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The truck was metal\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
