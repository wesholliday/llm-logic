The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This means that if the antecedent (Joe went to the park) is true, then the consequent (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Joe went to the park.\" This means that the antecedent of the conditional statement is true.\n\n3. Since the antecedent of the conditional statement is true, and the conditional statement states that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true, we can infer that the consequent (Lucy went to the zoo) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
