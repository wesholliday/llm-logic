The first premise is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Sam took a plane) is true, then the consequent (Erin took a train) must also be true.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Sam took a plane.\" This means the antecedent of the conditional statement is true.\n\n3. Since the antecedent is true, and the conditional statement says that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true, we can infer that the consequent is also true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'Erin took a train.'\n\nAnswer: yes"
