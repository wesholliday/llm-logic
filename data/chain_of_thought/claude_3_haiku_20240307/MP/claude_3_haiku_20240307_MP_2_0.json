            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'The unicorn was in the forest' from the given information, let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This means that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"The griffin was in the forest.\" This means that the griffin was indeed in the forest.\n\n3. To infer 'The unicorn was in the forest,' we need to apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is true, then the consequent (the \"then\" part) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest,\" and the antecedent \"The griffin was in the forest\" is true. Therefore, we can infer that the consequent \"The unicorn was in the forest\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
