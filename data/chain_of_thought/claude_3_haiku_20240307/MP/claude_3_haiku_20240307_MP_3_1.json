We are given the following two statements:\n   - If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n   - The book was written by James.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel\".\n\n3.
