The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n2. The second statement is the antecedent of the conditional statement: \"The doll was plastic.\"\n3. In a valid modus ponens argument, if we have a conditional statement and the antecedent is true, then we can infer the consequent.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer 'The truck was metal.'\n\nAnswer: yes"
