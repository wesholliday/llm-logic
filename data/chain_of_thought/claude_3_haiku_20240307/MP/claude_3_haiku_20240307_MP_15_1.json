The second premise is: \"Sam took a plane.\"\n3. The question is asking whether we can infer from these two premises that \"Erin took a train.\"\n\nThe key to answering this question is to recognize that the first premise is a conditional statement in the form of \"If A, then B.\" This means that if the antecedent (A) is true, then the consequent (B) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent is \"Sam took a plane\" and the consequent is \"Erin took a train.\" Since the second premise states that the antecedent is true (\"Sam took a plane\"), we can infer that the consequent is also true, which means that \"Erin took a train.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
