It can be represented as:\nIf Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\nOr, in symbolic logic: A \u2192 C\n\nThe second statement, \"Alex finished the race,\" is a simple statement that affirms the antecedent (A) of the conditional statement.\n\nThe question is whether we can infer that \"Chris finished the race\" from the given information.\n\nTo do this, we can use the rule of modus ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (A \u2192 C) and the antecedent (A) is true, then we can conclude that the consequent (C) is also true.\n\nIn this case, we have the conditional statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" (A \u2192 C), and we know that \"Alex finished the race\" (A) is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"Chris finished the race\" (C) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
