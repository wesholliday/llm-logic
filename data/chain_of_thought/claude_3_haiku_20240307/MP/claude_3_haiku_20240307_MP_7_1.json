The first statement, 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race,' is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition 'Alex finished the race' is true, then the conclusion 'Chris finished the race' is also true.\n\n2. The second statement, 'Alex finished the race,' provides the antecedent of the conditional statement.\n\n3. When we have a conditional statement and the antecedent is true, we can use the rule of modus ponens to infer the consequent.\n\nModus ponens states that if the statement 'If p, then q' is true, and the statement 'p' is true, then the statement 'q' must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that 'Chris finished the race.'\n\nAnswer: yes"
