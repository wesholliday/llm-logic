The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the alien visited Mars\" and Q is \"the robot visited Jupiter\".\n\n2. The second statement is the antecedent of the conditional statement, which is \"the alien visited Mars\".\n\n3. The rules of propositional logic state that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and the antecedent P is true, then we can infer the consequent Q is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The robot visited Jupiter\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
