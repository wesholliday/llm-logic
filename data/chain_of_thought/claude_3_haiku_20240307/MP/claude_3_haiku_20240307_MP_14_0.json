The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This means that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"The bear was in the cave.\" This means that the condition in the first statement is true.\n3. Since the condition in the first statement is true (the bear was in the cave), we can infer that the conclusion in the first statement is also true (the wolf was in the den).\n\nAnswer: yes"
