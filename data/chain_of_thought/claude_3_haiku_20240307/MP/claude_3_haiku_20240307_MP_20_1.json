The given information includes two statements:\n   - If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n   - The apple was red.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be written in the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is the condition (the apple was red) and Q is the consequence (the banana was yellow).\n\n3. The second statement, \"The apple was red\", is the affirmation of the condition P in the conditional statement.\n\n4. When the condition P is affirmed in a conditional statement, we can infer the consequence Q. This is a valid form of logical inference known as modus ponens.\n\nAnswer: yes"
