The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This means that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the apple was red, the banana must have been yellow.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"The apple was red.\" This means that the condition in the first statement is true, i.e., the apple was red.\n\n3. From the first statement, we know that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. Since the apple was red (second statement), we can infer that the banana was yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes"
