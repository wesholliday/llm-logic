The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This means that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"The cake was chocolate.\" This means that the cake was indeed chocolate.\n3. Since the first statement is a conditional statement and the second statement affirms the antecedent (the cake was chocolate), we can apply the rule of modus ponens to infer the consequent (the muffins were blueberry).\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that 'The muffins were blueberry'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
