The second statement is 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Sam took a plane) is true, then the consequent (Erin took a train) is also true.\n4. However, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. In other words, just because the consequent (Erin took a train) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (Sam took a plane) is also true.\n5. Therefore, from the given information, we cannot infer that 'Sam took a plane'.\n\nAnswer: no"
