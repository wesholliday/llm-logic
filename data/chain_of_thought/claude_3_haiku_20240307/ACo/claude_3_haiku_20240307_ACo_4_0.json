We have the statement 'The robot visited Jupiter'.\n2. We also have the statement 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the alien visited Mars) is true, then the consequent (the robot visited Jupiter) must also be true.\n4. Since we know that the consequent 'The robot visited Jupiter' is true, we can use the conditional statement to infer that the antecedent 'The alien visited Mars' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
