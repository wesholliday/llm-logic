The first statement is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n2. The second statement is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the consequent (Mark bought the blue shirt) is also true.\n4. Since we know that the consequent (Mark bought the blue shirt) is true, we can infer that the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt) is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'Lisa bought the red shirt'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
