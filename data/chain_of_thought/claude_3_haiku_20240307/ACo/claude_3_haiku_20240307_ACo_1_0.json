'Sue was at the wedding' is a given statement.\n2. 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is also a given statement.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequent (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true.\n\nHowever, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. In other words, just because the consequent (Sue was at the wedding) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) is also true.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot infer that 'Mary was at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer: no"
