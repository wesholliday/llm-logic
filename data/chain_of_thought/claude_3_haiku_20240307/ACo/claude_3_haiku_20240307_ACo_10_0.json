We also have the statement 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the dog was inside) is true, then the consequent (the cat was outside) is also true.\n4. However, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. In other words, just because the consequent (the cat was outside) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (the dog was inside) is also true.\n5. Therefore, from the given information, we cannot infer 'The dog was inside'.\n\nAnswer: no"
