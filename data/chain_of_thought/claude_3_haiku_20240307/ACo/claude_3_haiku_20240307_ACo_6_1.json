'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta'\n\nWe can analyze this using logical reasoning:\n\n1. The statement 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta' is a conditional statement. This means that if the antecedent (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the consequent (Bob chose pasta) must also be true.\n2. We are also given that 'Bob chose pasta'. This means that the consequent of the conditional statement is true.\n3. However, the truth of the consequent does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot infer with certainty that 'Sue chose pizza'. The information provided is not sufficient to draw that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
