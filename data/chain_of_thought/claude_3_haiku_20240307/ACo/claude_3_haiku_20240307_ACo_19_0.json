The first statement is 'Jen watched basketball'.\n2. The second statement is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequent (Jen watched basketball) is also true.\n4. However, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. In other words, just because the consequent (Jen watched basketball) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (Tom watched football) is also true.\n5. Therefore, from the given information, we cannot infer that 'Tom watched football'.\n\nAnswer: no"
