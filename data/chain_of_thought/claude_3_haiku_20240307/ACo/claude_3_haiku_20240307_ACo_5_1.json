This is a simple statement of fact.\n\nThe second statement is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\". This is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis. It means that if Jeff played basketball, then it necessarily follows that Amy played tennis.\n\nNow, the question is whether we can infer from these two statements that \"Jeff played basketball\".\n\nTo infer that Jeff played basketball, we would need to know that the condition in the second statement is true, i.e., that Jeff did indeed play basketball. However, the given information does not directly state this. The second statement only tells us the consequence (Amy playing tennis) if the condition (Jeff playing basketball) is true, but it does not confirm that the condition is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that \"Jeff played basketball\". The given statements do not provide enough information to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
