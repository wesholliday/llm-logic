The first statement is 'The wolf was in the den'.\n2. The second statement is 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the bear was in the cave) is true, then the consequent (the wolf was in the den) is also true.\n4. Since we are given that 'The wolf was in the den', we can use the second statement to infer that the antecedent, 'The bear was in the cave', must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
