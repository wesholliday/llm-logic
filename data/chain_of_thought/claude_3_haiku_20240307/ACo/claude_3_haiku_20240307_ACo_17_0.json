We also have the statement 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the consequent (Kate ate salad) must also be true.\n4. However, the given information only tells us that 'Kate ate salad', which is the consequent of the conditional statement.\n5. From this, we cannot infer the truth of the antecedent (Ben ate pasta). The conditional statement only tells us that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true, but it does not tell us anything about the truth of the antecedent itself.\n\nAnswer: no"
