The first statement is 'The pants were denim'.\n2. The second statement is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the shirt was cotton) is true, then the conclusion (the pants were denim) is also true.\n\nHowever, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. In other words, just because the conclusion (the pants were denim) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the condition (the shirt was cotton) is also true.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot infer that 'The shirt was cotton'.\n\nAnswer: no"
