The first statement is 'The book is a mystery novel'.\n2. The second statement is 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition 'the book was written by James' is true, then the consequence 'the book is a mystery novel' is also true.\n4. However, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. In other words, just because the consequence 'the book is a mystery novel' is true, it does not necessarily mean that the condition 'the book was written by James' is also true.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The book was written by James' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
