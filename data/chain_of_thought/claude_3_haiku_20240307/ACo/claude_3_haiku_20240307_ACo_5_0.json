The first statement is 'Amy played tennis'.\n2. The second statement is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) is true, then the consequent (Amy played tennis) is also true.\n\nHowever, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. In other words, just because the consequent (Amy played tennis) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) is also true.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot infer that 'Jeff played basketball'.\n\nAnswer: no"
