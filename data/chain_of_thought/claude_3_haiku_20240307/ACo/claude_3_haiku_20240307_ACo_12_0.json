The first statement is 'Lucy went to the zoo'.\n2. The second statement is 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Joe went to the park) is true, then the consequent (Lucy went to the zoo) is also true.\n4. However, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. In other words, just because the consequent (Lucy went to the zoo) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (Joe went to the park) is also true.\n5. Therefore, from the given information, we cannot infer that 'Joe went to the park'.\n\nAnswer: no"
