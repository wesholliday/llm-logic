We have the statement 'The banana was yellow'.\n2. We also have the conditional statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'.\n3. The conditional statement tells us that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, it does not tell us anything about the actual color of the apple.\n4. Since we know 'The banana was yellow', this means that the condition in the conditional statement is satisfied, i.e., the apple was red.\n5. However, the conditional statement does not give us the direct inference that 'The apple was red'. It only tells us that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot infer 'The apple was red'.

If the banana was yellow and the statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' is true, then we can infer that the apple was red. This is because the conditional statement is true, and the consequent (the banana was yellow) is true, so the antecedent (the apple was red) must also be true.\n\n2. However, the reverse is not necessarily true. Just because the banana was yellow, it does not necessarily mean that the apple was red. The conditional statement only tells us that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow, but it does not tell us that if the banana was yellow, then the apple must have been red.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The apple was red' from 'The banana was yellow' and 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'.\n\nAnswer: no"
