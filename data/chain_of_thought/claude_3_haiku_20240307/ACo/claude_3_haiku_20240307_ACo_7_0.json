We are given the statement 'Chris finished the race'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race'.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n- The statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' is a conditional statement. It means that if Alex finished the race, then it necessarily follows that Chris finished the race.\n- However, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. Just because Chris finished the race, it does not necessarily mean that Alex finished the race.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot infer that 'Alex finishes the race'.\n\nAnswer: no"
