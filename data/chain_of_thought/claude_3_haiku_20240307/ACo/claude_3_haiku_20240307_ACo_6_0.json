The second statement is 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta'.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the consequence (Bob chose pasta) is also true.\n\nNow, we know that the consequence (Bob chose pasta) is true, as stated in the first statement. This means that the condition (Sue chose pizza) must also be true, in order for the conditional statement to be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that 'Sue chose pizza'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
