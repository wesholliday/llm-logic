The second statement is 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the car was red) is true, then the consequent (the truck was blue) is also true.\n\nHowever, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. In other words, just because the consequent (the truck was blue) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (the car was red) is also true.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot infer that 'The car was red'.\n\nAnswer: no"
