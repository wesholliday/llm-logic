The first statement, \"The truck was metal,\" is a fact.\n2. The second statement, \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal,\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n3. However, the given information does not tell us whether the doll was plastic or not. The second statement is a conditional statement, and we don't have enough information to determine the truth of the antecedent (the doll was plastic).\n4.
