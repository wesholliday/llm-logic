Just because the statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is true, it does not necessarily mean that the inverse statement \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\" is also true.\n\nThis is because the original statement only establishes a relationship between the two events when the first event (Joe going to the park) is true, but it does not provide any information about what happens when the first event is false (Joe did not go to the park).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: no"
