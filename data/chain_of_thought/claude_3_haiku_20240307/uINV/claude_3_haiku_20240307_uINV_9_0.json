            "content": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the given information and the logical implications.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which means that it establishes a relationship between two events: if the first event (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the second event (Mark buying the blue shirt) is also true.\n\nNow, the question is asking whether we can infer that if the first event (Lisa buying the red shirt) is not true, then the second event (Mark buying the blue shirt) is also not true.\n\nTo determine this, we need to consider the logical relationship between the original statement and its contrapositive.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement is: \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nThe contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if one is true, the other is also true.\n\nTherefore, if we know that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we can infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, as this is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
