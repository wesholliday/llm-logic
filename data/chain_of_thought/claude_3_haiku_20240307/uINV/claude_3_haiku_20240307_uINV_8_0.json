This means that if the vampire was awake, we can infer that the mummy was also awake.\n3. However, the question is asking whether we can infer the opposite: \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\"\n4. This is not a valid inference from the original premise. Just because the vampire being awake implies the mummy being awake, it does not necessarily mean that the vampire being not awake implies the mummy being not awake.\n5. There could be other factors that could cause the mummy to be awake, even if the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: no"
