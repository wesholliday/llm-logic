            "content": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the given information and the logical implications.\n\nThe first statement is: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the griffin was in the forest) is true, then the consequent (the unicorn was in the forest) is also true.\n\nNow, the question is asking whether we can infer that if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nTo determine this, we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is the statement that is logically equivalent to the original statement, but with the antecedent and consequent negated.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement is: \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nThis means that if the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was also not in the forest. In other words, the absence of the unicorn in the forest implies the absence of the griffin in the forest.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the logical reasoning, we can infer that if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes"
