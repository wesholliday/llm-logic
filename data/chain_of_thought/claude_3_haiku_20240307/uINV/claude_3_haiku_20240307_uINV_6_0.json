The contrapositive is the statement that reverses the antecedent and the consequent, and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement is: \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\nThis means that if Bob did not choose pasta, then we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza. In other words, if Sue did not choose pizza, then we can infer that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
