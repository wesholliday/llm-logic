            "content": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the given information and the logical implications.\n\nThe given information is: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\n\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the shirt was cotton) is true, then the consequent (the pants were denim) is also true.\n\nHowever, the question is asking whether we can infer that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\n\nThis is a different statement, and it is not necessarily true just because the original conditional statement is true.\n\nThe reason is that the original statement only tells us about the relationship between the shirt being cotton and the pants being denim, but it does not provide any information about the relationship between the shirt not being cotton and the pants not being denim.\n\nIn other words, the original statement does not rule out the possibility that the pants could still be denim even if the shirt was not cotton.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\n\nAnswer: no"
