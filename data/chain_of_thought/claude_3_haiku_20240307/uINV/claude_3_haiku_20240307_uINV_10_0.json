The contrapositive is: \"If the cat is not outside, then the dog is not inside.\"\n\nThis statement can be expressed in symbolic logic as:\nIf (cat is not outside) then (dog is not inside)\n\nNow, we can compare the original statement and the contrapositive:\n- The original statement says that if the dog is inside, then the cat is outside.\n- The contrapositive says that if the cat is not outside, then the dog is not inside.\n\nThese two statements are logically equivalent. Therefore, we can infer that if the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
