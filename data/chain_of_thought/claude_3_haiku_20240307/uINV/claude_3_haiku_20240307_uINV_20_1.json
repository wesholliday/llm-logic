This does not necessarily mean that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\n\nThere could be other factors that influenced the color of the banana, independent of the color of the apple.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that \"if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"

It does not necessarily imply the converse, which would be: \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\"\n\nThe converse of a conditional statement is not always true, even if the original statement is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\n\nAnswer: no"

In all other cases, the statement is true.\n\nIn this case, the original statement is true. Therefore, the only way the converse could be false is if the apple was not red, but the banana was still yellow.\n\nHowever, this is not a logically valid inference, as the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true, even if the original statement is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\n\nAnswer: no"

In this case, we cannot directly infer the negated statement from the given statement.\n\nThe reason is that the original statement does not provide any information about the case where the apple was not red.
