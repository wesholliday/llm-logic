It only states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n\nThe proposed inference is the contrapositive of the original statement, which is a valid logical inference. However, the original statement does not provide enough information to determine the truth of the contrapositive.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\" based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
