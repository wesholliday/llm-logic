The inverse of a conditional statement is not always true, even if the original statement is true.\n\nIn this case, we cannot infer that if the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel. There could be other authors who write mystery novels, and the book in question could still be a mystery novel even if it was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: no"
