This is known as the contrapositive.\n\nHowever, the statement \"If not P, then not Q\" is not automatically true, even if the original \"If P, then Q\" is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\" The correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: no"

This is because the conditional statement only states that if P is true, then Q must be true, but it does not necessarily imply the converse.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: no"

In other words, the statement is saying that these two events are linked - if one is true, then the other must also be true.\n\nNow, the question asks whether we can infer that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.
