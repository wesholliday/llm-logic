The inverse may or may not be true, depending on the specific situation.\n\nIn this case, we cannot infer that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis. The original statement only tells us that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. It does not provide any information about what would happen if Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no"
