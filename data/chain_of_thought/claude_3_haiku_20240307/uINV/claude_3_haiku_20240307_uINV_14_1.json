The original statement is: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\"\n2. This statement is a conditional statement, which means that it establishes a relationship between two events: the bear being in the cave and the wolf being in the den.\n3. The statement does not say anything about what happens if the bear is not in the cave. It only tells us what happens if the bear is in the cave.\n4. To infer that if the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den, we would need to assume that the relationship between the bear and the wolf is a strict one-to-one correspondence, meaning that the presence of the bear in the cave is the only condition for the wolf to be in the den.\n5. However, the given information does not provide enough evidence to make this assumption. It is possible that there could be other factors or conditions that determine the presence of the wolf in the den, independent of the bear's location.\n\nAnswer: no"
