The original statement only tells us that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. It does not say anything about the converse or the inverse of this statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"if the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal\" based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
