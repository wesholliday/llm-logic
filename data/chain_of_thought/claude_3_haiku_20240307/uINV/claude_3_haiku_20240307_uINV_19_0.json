The contrapositive is the statement that has the opposite of the antecedent and the opposite of the consequent.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement is: \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nThis means that if the second part of the contrapositive is true (Tom did not watch football), then the first part of the contrapositive is also true (Jen did not watch basketball).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes"
