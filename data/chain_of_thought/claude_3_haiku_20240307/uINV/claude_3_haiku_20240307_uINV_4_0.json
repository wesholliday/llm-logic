The contrapositive is the statement that is logically equivalent to the original statement, but with the antecedent and consequent negated.\n\nThe contrapositive of the given statement is: \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\"\n\nThis means that if the robot did not visit Jupiter, then we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars. However, the question is asking about the reverse implication, which is not directly stated in the given information.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that if the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: no"
