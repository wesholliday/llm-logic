            "content": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true.\n\nNow, the question is asking whether we can infer that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding. This is the inverse of the original statement.\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we need to consider the logical relationship between the original statement and its inverse.\n\nIn general, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. Just because the original statement is true, it does not mean that the inverse is also true.\n\nIn this case, the original statement is a conditional statement, and the inverse is also a conditional statement. However, the inverse does not necessarily follow from the original statement.\n\nIt is possible that even if Mary was not at the wedding, Sue could have still been at the wedding for other reasons. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no"
