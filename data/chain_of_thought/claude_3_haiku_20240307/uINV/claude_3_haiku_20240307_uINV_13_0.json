The contrapositive is the statement that has the opposite of the antecedent and the opposite of the consequent.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement is: \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\"\n\nThis means that if the truck was not blue, then the car was not red. This is logically equivalent to the statement in the question.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
