The first premise is 'It's not the case that the flob must be movated'. This means that the flob is not necessarily movated.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled'. This means that the flob is either movated or skizzled, but not both.\n\n3. Since the first premise tells us that the flob is not necessarily movated, the only other possibility is that the flob is skizzled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that 'The flob is skizzled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
