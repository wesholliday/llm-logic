This means that the dreb does not have to be spened.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed\". This means that either the dreb must be spened, or the dreb is vroombed.\n\n3. Since the first statement tells us that the dreb does not have to be spened, the only remaining possibility is that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The dreb is vroombed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
