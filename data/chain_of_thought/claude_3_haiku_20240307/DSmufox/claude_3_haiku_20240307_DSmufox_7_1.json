The first premise is 'It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked'. This means that the whiffle does not necessarily have to be tinked.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked'. This means that the whiffle must either be tinked or shanked.\n\n3. Since the first premise states that the whiffle does not necessarily have to be tinked, the only remaining possibility is that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that 'The whiffle is shanked'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
