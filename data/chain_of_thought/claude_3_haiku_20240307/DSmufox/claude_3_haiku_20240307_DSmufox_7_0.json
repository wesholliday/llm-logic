The first premise is 'It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked'. This means that it is not necessary for the whiffle to be tinked.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked'. This means that the whiffle must either be tinked or shanked, but not both.\n\n3. From the first premise, we know that the whiffle is not necessarily tinked. Therefore, the only other possibility is that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer that 'The whiffle is shanked'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
