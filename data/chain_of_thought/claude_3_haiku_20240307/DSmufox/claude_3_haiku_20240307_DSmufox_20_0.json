The first premise is 'It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned'. This means that the fleeg does not have to be surned.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered'. This means that the fleeg is either surned or bluttered.\n\n3. Since the first premise tells us that the fleeg does not have to be surned, the only remaining possibility is that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that 'The fleeg is bluttered'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
