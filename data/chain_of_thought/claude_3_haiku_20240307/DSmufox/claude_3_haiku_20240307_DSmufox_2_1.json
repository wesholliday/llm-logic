The first premise is 'It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed'. This means that it is not necessary for the wug to be bimmed.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the wug must be bimmed or it is flooped'. This means that either the wug must be bimmed, or the wug is flooped. It's one or the other.\n\n3. Combining the two premises, we can conclude that the wug is not necessarily bimmed, and it must either be bimmed or flooped.\n\n4.
