This means that the shank does not have to be nugged.\n2) The second premise is \"Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked\". This means that the shank must either be nugged or plooked.\n3) Since the shank does not have to be nugged (from the first premise), the only other option is that it must be plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
