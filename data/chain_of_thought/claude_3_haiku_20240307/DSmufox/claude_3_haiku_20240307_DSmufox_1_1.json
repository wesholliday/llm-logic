This means that the flugel does not have to be zargled.\n2) The second statement is \"Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed\". This means that the flugel is either zargled or blimmed, but not both.\n3) From the first statement, we know the flugel does not have to be zargled. \n4) That means, from the second statement, the flugel must be blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
