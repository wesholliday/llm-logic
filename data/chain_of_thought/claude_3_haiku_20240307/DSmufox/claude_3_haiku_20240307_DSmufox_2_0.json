The first premise is 'It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed'. This means that it is not necessary for the wug to be bimmed.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the wug must be bimmed or it is flooped'. This means that either the wug must be bimmed, or the wug is flooped.\n\n3. Since it is not the case that the wug must be bimmed (from the first premise), the only remaining possibility is that the wug is flooped.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that 'The wug is flooped'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
