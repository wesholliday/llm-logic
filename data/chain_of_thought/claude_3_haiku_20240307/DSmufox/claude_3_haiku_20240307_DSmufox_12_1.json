This means that it is not necessary for the smip to be lupped.\n2) The second premise is \"Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped\". This means that either the smip must be lupped, or the smip is shripped.\n3) From the first premise, we know that it is not necessary for the smip to be lupped. \n4) Therefore, the smip must be shripped, since the second premise states that either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes"
