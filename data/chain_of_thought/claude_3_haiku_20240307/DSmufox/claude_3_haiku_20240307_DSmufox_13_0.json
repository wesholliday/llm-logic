The first premise is 'It's not the case that the glip must be tragged'. This means that it is not necessary for the glip to be tragged.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged'. This means that the glip must either be tragged or slogged, but not both.\n\n3. Since it is not necessary for the glip to be tragged (from the first premise), the only remaining possibility is that the glip is slogged.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that 'The glip is slogged'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
