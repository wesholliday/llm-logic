This means that it is not necessary for the wug to be garpled.\n\n2) The second premise is \"Either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged\". This means that the wug must either be garpled or it must be sproinged.\n\n3) Since it is not necessary for the wug to be garpled (from the first premise), and the wug must either be garpled or sproinged (from the second premise), we can infer that the wug must be sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
