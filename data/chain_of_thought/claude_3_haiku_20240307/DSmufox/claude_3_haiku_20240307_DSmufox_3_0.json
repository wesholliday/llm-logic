This means that it is not necessary for the splat to be quanked.\n\n2) The second premise is \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed\". This means that the splat must either be quanked or it must be morphed, but not both.\n\n3) Since it is not necessary for the splat to be quanked (from the first premise), and the splat must either be quanked or morphed (from the second premise), we can infer that the splat must be morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
