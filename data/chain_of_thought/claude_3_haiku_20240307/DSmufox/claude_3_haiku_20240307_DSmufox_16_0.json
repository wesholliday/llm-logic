The first premise is \"It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted.\" This means that it is not necessary for the sneg to be sproted.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either the sneg must be sproted or it is crampled.\" This means that either the sneg must be sproted, or the sneg is crampled.\n\n3. Since it is not necessary for the sneg to be sproted (from the first premise), the only other possibility is that the sneg is crampled.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that \"The sneg is crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
