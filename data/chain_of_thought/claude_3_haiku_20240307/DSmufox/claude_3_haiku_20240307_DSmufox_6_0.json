The first premise is 'It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped'. This means that the grommet is not required to be plopped.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed'. This means that the grommet must either be plopped or it is sploffed.\n\n3. Since the first premise tells us that the grommet is not required to be plopped, the only remaining possibility is that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that 'The grommet is sploffed'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
