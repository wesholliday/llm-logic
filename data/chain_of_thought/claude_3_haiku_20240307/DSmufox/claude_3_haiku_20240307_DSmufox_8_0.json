The first premise is \"It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled.\" This means that the sprocket does not have to be daggled.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked.\" This means that the sprocket must either be daggled or cranked, but not both.\n\n3. Since the first premise tells us that the sprocket does not have to be daggled, the only other option is that the sprocket must be cranked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The sprocket is cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
