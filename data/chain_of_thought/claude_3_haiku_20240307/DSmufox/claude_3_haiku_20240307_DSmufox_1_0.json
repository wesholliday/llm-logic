The first premise is 'It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled'. This means that the flugel is not necessarily zargled.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed'. This means that the flugel is either zargled or blimmed, but not both.\n\n3. Since the first premise tells us that the flugel is not necessarily zargled, the only remaining possibility is that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that 'The flugel is blimmed'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
