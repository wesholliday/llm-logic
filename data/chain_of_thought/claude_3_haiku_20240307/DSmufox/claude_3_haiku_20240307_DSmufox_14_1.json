The first premise states 'It's not the case that the clug must be snugged'. This means that the clug does not necessarily have to be snugged.\n\n2. The second premise states 'Either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked'. This means that either the clug must be snugged, or the clug is fleeked.\n\n3.
