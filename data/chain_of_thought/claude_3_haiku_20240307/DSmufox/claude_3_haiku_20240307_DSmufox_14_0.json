The first premise is 'It's not the case that the clug must be snugged'. This means that it is not necessary for the clug to be snugged.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked'. This means that the clug must either be snugged or it is fleeked.\n\n3. Since it is not necessary for the clug to be snugged (from the first premise), the only remaining possibility is that the clug is fleeked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer 'The clug is fleeked'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
