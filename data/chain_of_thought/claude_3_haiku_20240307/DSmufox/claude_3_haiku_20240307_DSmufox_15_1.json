This means that the dreb is not required to be spened.\n\nThe second premise is 'Either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed'. This means that either the dreb must be spened, or the dreb is vroombed. In other words, one of these two statements must be true.\n\nNow, based on the first premise, we know that the dreb is not required to be spened.
