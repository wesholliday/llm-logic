The first premise is 'It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked'. This means that the twonk does not necessarily have to be plinked.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the twonk must be plinked or it is varnished'. This means that the twonk must either be plinked or varnished, but not both.\n\n3. Since the first premise tells us that the twonk does not have to be plinked, the only other possibility is that the twonk is varnished.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that 'The twonk is varnished'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
