The first premise is 'It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed'. This means that the flug does not necessarily have to be zimmed.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed'. This means that the flug must either be zimmed or blummed, but not both.\n\n3. Since the flug does not have to be zimmed (from the first premise), and it must either be zimmed or blummed (from the second premise), we can infer that the flug must be blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
