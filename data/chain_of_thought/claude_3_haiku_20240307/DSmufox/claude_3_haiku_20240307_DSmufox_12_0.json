The first premise is 'It's not the case that the smip must be lupped'. This means that the smip is not required to be lupped.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped'. This means that the smip must either be lupped or it is shripped.\n\n3. Since the first premise tells us that the smip is not required to be lupped, the only remaining possibility is that the smip is shripped.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that 'The smip is shripped'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
