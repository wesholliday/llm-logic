This means that it is not necessary for the zinger to be smoogled.\n2) The second premise is \"Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled\". This means that the zinger must either be smoogled or fraggled.\n3) From the first premise, we know that the zinger is not necessarily smoogled. \n4) Therefore, from the second premise, we can infer that the zinger must be fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
