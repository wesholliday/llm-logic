The first premise is 'It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged'. This means that the smonk is not necessarily plagged.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled'. This means that the smonk must either be plagged or vreebled.\n\n3. Since the smonk is not necessarily plagged (from the first premise), the only remaining possibility is that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that 'The smonk is vreebled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
