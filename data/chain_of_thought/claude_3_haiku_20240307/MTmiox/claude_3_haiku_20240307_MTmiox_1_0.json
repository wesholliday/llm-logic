The first statement tells us that the flugel might not have been zargled. This means that it is possible that the flugel was not zargled.\n2. The second statement tells us that if the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled. This means that if the flugel was blimmed, then it was also zargled.\n3. Now, if the flugel might not have been zargled (from the first statement), and if the flugel was blimmed, then it must have been zargled (from the second statement), we can infer that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
