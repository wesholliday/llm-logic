We are given the following two statements:\n   - \"The smonk might not have plagged\"\n   - \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged\"\n\n2. From the second statement, we can infer that if the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the contrapositive of the second statement, which is: \"If the smonk did not plagg, then the smonk was not vreebled.\"\n\n4. The first statement tells us that \"The smonk might not have plagged.\" This means that it is possible that the smonk did not plagg.\n\n5. Applying the contrapositive of the second statement, we can infer that if the smonk did not plagg, then the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The smonk was not vreebled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
