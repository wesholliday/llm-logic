We are given two premises:\n   - \"The splat might not have quanked\"\n   - \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked\"\n\n2. From the second premise, we can infer that if the splat did not quank, then it was not morphed. This is because the second premise states that if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked.\n\n3. Since the first premise states that the splat \"might not have quanked\", this implies that it is possible the splat did not quank.\n\n4. Therefore, if the splat did not quank, then we can infer that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes"

From the second statement, we can infer that if the splat did not quank, then it was not morphed.\n4. This is because the second statement establishes a conditional relationship: if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked.\n5.
