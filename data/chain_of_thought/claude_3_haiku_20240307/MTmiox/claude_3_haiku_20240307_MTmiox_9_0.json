We are given the statement 'The twonk might not have been varnished'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished'.\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that if the twonk was not varnished, then it was not plinked.\n4. Since the first statement says 'The twonk might not have been varnished', this means that it is possible that the twonk was not varnished.\n5. Therefore, if the twonk was not varnished, then it was not plinked, according to the second statement.\n6. Combining steps 4 and 5, we can conclude that 'The twonk was not plinked'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
