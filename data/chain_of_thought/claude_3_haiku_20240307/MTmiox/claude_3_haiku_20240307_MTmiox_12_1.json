The first statement, \"The smip might not have lupped the zoint\", suggests that it is possible that the smip did not lup the zoint.\n2. The second statement, \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint\", implies that if the smip was shripped, then it must have lupped the zoint.\n3. Now, if we assume that the smip was shripped, then the second statement would imply that the smip must have lupped the zoint. However, this contradicts the first statement, which suggests that the smip might not have lupped the zoint.\n4. Therefore, the only way to resolve this contradiction is to conclude that the smip was not shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes"
