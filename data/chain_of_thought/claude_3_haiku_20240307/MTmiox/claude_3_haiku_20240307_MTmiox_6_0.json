The first statement is 'The grommet might not have plopped the frink'.\n2. The second statement is 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink'.\n3. The second statement implies that if the grommet was sploffed, then it must have plopped the frink.\n4. The first statement suggests that the grommet might not have plopped the frink.\n5. If the grommet might not have plopped the frink, then it is possible that the grommet was not sploffed.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that 'The grommet was not sploffed'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
