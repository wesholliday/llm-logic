We are given the statement 'The flob might not have movated'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated.\n4. The first statement suggests that the flob might not have movated.\n5. If the flob might not have movated, then it is possible that the flob was not skizzled, since the second statement says that if the flob was skizzled, then it must have movated.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that 'The flob was not skizzled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
