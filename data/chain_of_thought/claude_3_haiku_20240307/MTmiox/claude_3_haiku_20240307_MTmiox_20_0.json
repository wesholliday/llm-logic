This means that it is possible that the fleeg was not surned.\n\n4) If the fleeg was not surned, then it could not have been bluttered, since the second statement tells us that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\n\n5) Therefore, we can infer that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes"
