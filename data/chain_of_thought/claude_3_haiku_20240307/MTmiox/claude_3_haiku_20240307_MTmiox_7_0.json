The first premise is 'The whiffle might not have tinked'. This means that it is possible that the whiffle did not tink.\n\n2. The second premise is 'If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked'. This means that if the whiffle was shanked, then it must have tinked.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the contrapositive of the second premise, which is 'If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked'.\n\n4. Since the first premise states that 'The whiffle might not have tinked', this means that it is possible that the whiffle did not tink.\n\n5. Applying the contrapositive of the second premise, we can infer that if the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The whiffle was not shanked' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
