The first statement is 'The clug might not have been snugged'. This means that it is possible that the clug was not snugged.\n\n2. The second statement is 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged'. This means that if the clug was fleeked, then it must have been snugged.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the contrapositive of the second statement: 'If the clug was not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked'. This is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. Since the first statement tells us that the clug might not have been snugged, the contrapositive of the second statement implies that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that 'The clug was not fleeked'.\n\nAnswer: yes"

This statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the clug was fleeked) is true, then the consequent (the clug must have been snugged) is also true.\n\nNow, let's consider the first statement, \"The clug might not have been snugged\". This statement suggests that the clug might not have been snugged, which contradicts the consequent of the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, if the clug might not have been snugged, then the clug could not have been fleeked, as the conditional statement requires the clug to have been snugged if it was fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
