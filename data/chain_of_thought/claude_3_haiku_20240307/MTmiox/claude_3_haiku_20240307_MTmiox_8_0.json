We are given the following two premises:\n   - \"The sprocket might not have been daggled\"\n   - \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled\"\n\n2. From the second premise, we can infer that if the sprocket was not daggled, then it was not cranked. This is because the premise states that if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled.\n\n3. The first premise tells us that \"The sprocket might not have been daggled\". This means that it is possible that the sprocket was not daggled.\n\n4. Combining the inferences from the two premises, we can conclude that if the sprocket might not have been daggled, then it was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
