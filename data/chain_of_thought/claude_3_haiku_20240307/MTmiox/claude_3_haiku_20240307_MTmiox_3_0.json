We are given the statement 'The splat might not have quanked'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked'.\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that if the splat was not morphed, then it might not have quanked.\n4. Since the first statement says 'The splat might not have quanked', this implies that the splat was not morphed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer 'The splat was not morphed'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
