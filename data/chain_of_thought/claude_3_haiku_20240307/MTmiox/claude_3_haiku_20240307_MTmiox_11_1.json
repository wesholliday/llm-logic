The first statement is 'The flug might not have been zimmed'.\n2. The second statement is 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed'.\n3. The logic of the second statement is as follows: if the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed. This means that if the flug was not zimmed, then it could not have been blummed.\n4. The first statement tells us that the flug 'might not have been zimmed'. This means that it's possible the flug was not zimmed.\n5. Combining the information from the two statements, if the flug was not zimmed, then it could not have been blummed.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that 'The flug was not blummed'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
