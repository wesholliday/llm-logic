This means that if the flug was not zimmed, then it must not have been blummed.\n\n3) The first statement tells us that the flug \"might not have been zimmed\". This means that it is possible the flug was not zimmed.\n\n4) Combining the two statements, we can infer that if the flug was not zimmed, then it must not have been blummed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
