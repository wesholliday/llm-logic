The first statement suggests that the flob might not have movated, which means it's possible that the flob did not move.\n\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement that says if the flob was skizzled, then it must have movated.\n\n4. If the flob might not have movated (first statement), then it is possible that the flob was not skizzled, because the second statement says that if the flob was skizzled, then it must have movated.\n\n5.
