We are given the following two statements:\n   - \"The sneg might not have sproted the frink\"\n   - \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink\"\n\n2. From the second statement, we can infer that if the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink.\n\n3. Now, the first statement tells us that \"The sneg might not have sproted the frink\". This means that it is possible that the sneg did not sprot the frink.\n\n4. Combining the information from the two statements, we can infer that if the sneg did not sprot the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
