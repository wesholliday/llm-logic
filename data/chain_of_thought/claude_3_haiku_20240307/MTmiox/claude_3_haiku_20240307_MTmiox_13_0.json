The first statement, \"The glip might not have tragged,\" suggests that the glip might not have tragged, but it does not definitively state that the glip was not tragged.\n2. The second statement, \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged,\" implies that if the glip was slogged, then it must have tragged.\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that if the glip was not tragged, then it was not slogged. This is because the second statement establishes a conditional relationship between the glip being slogged and the glip having tragged.\n4. Therefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The glip was not slogged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
