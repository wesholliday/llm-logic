We are given the following two premises:\n   - \"The sprocket might not have been daggled\"\n   - \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled\"\n\n2. From the second premise, we can infer that if the sprocket was not daggled, then it was not cranked. This is because the second premise states that if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled.\n\n3. Combining the two premises, we can infer that if the sprocket might not have been daggled (as stated in the first premise), then it was not cranked.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
