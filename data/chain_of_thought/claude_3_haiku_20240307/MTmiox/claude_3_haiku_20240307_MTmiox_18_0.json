We are given the following premises:\n   - \"The shank might not have been nugged\"\n   - \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged\"\n\n2. From the second premise, we can infer that if the shank was not nugged, then it was not plooked. This is because the premise states that if the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged.\n\n3. Therefore, if the shank might not have been nugged (as stated in the first premise), then we can infer that the shank was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
