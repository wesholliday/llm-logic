We are given the following two statements:\n   - \"The dreb might not have been spened\"\n   - \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened\"\n\n2. From the second statement, we can infer that if the dreb was vroombed, then it must have been spened.\n\n3. Now, the first statement tells us that \"The dreb might not have been spened\". This means that it is possible that the dreb was not spened.\n\n4. If the dreb was not spened, then it could not have been vroombed, since the second statement tells us that if the dreb was vroombed, then it must have been spened.\n\n5. Therefore, we can infer that \"The dreb was not vroombed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
