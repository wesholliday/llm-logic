It implies that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer 'The fribble was not snurgled'?\"\n\nIf the fribble might not have crinked, and if the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked, we can infer that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nThis is because the first statement contradicts the conclusion that would be drawn from the second statement. If the fribble might not have crinked, then it could not have been the case that the fribble was snurgled, since the second statement says that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The fribble was not snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
