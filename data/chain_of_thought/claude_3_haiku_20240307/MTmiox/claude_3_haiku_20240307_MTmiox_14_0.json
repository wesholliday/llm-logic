We are given the following two statements:\n   - \"The clug might not have been snugged\"\n   - \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged\"\n\n2. From the second statement, we can infer that if the clug was not snugged, then it must not have been fleeked. This is because the statement says that if the clug was fleeked, then it must have been snugged.\n\n3. Therefore, from the first statement \"The clug might not have been snugged\" and the inference from the second statement, we can conclude that \"The clug was not fleeked\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
