This statement does not provide any information about the specific location of the fribble, only that it could be in one of two possible locations.\n\nFrom this statement, we can infer that the fribble might be on the wumble, as this is one of the two possible locations mentioned in the original statement. However, we cannot infer that the fribble is definitely on the wumble, as the statement also allows for the possibility that the fribble might be in the blurble.\n\nAnswer: yes"
