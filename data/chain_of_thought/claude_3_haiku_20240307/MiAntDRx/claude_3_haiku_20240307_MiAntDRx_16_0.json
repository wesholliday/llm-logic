The original statement presents a list of possibilities for what \"the wibble\" might be, including \"wumble shimble\" and \"blurble wobble\". However, this does not necessarily mean that \"the wibble\" is exclusively \"blurble wobble\". There could be other possibilities not mentioned in the original statement. Without more context or information, we cannot confidently conclude that \"the wibble\" is specifically \"blurble wobble\".\n\nAnswer: no"
