            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The quibble might be on the quibble or in the fizzle\" is a disjunction, meaning that either the quibble might be on the quibble or it might be in the fizzle. This statement does not provide any information about the relationship between the quibble and the fizzle, other than the fact that the quibble might be in the fizzle.\n\nTo infer \"The quibble might be in the fizzle\" from the given statement, we need to consider the logical implications of the disjunction. Since the original statement says that the quibble might be in the fizzle, we can conclude that the quibble might be in the fizzle.\n\nAnswer: yes"
