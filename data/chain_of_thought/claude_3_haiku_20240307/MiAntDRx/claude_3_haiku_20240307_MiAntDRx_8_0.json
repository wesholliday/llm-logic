            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The flibbit might be zump on frazzle or zooble for frozz wibble\" does not provide enough information to infer the statement \"The flibbit might be zooble for frozz wibble\". The original statement presents two possibilities for the flibbit: it might be zump on frazzle or it might be zooble for frozz wibble. However, the statement does not specify which of these two possibilities is true. Therefore, we cannot infer that the flibbit is specifically zooble for frozz wibble based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no"
