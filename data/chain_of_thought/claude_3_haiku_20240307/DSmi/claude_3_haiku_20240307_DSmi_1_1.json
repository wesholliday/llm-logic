            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'Fido is inside' from the given premises, let's analyze the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The first premise is 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden'. This means that Fido is either inside or in the garden, but not both. It's an 'either-or' statement.\n2. The second premise is 'Fido might not be in the garden'. This means that it's possible that Fido is not in the garden.\n3. Combining the two premises, we can conclude that if Fido is not in the garden, then he must be inside. This is because the first premise states that Fido is either inside or in the garden, and the second premise tells us that he might not be in the garden.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that 'Fido is inside'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
