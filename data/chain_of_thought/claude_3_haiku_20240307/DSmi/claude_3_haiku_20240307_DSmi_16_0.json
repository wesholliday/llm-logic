This statement implies that the pen is either in the bag or on the desk, but not both.\n3. The second statement is: \"The pen might not be on my desk.\"\n4. This statement suggests that the pen may not be on the desk.\n5. Combining the two statements, we can infer that if the pen is not on the desk, then it must be in the bag.\n6. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
