The first statement is \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\" This statement suggests that the umbrella is not necessarily in the closet.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible inferences we can make:\n\nIf the umbrella is not in the closet, and it must be either in the car or in the closet, then the only remaining possibility is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes"
