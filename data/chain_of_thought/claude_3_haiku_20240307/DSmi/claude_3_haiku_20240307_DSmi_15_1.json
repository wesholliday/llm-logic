The shoes are lined up by the door.\n\nPremise 2 tells us that the second possibility (the shoes are lined up by the door) might not be true.\n\nTherefore, if the shoes are not lined up by the door (as per Premise 2), then the only remaining possibility is that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes"

The second premise is 'The shoes might not be lined up by the door'. This statement suggests that the shoes may not be lined up by the door.\n3. Now, let's consider the two possibilities from the first premise:\n   - If the shoes are not lined up by the door, then they must be in the closet (since the first premise states that it's either one or the other).\n   - If the shoes are lined up by the door, then the second premise contradicts this, as it states that the shoes might not be lined up by the door.\n4.
