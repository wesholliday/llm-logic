The first statement is \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\" This is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\" This means that the possibility of the keys being in the cabinet is not certain.\n\n3. If the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, then the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
