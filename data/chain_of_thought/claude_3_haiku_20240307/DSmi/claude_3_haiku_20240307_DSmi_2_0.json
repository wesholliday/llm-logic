The first statement is \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\" This means that the book must be in one of these two locations.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The book might not be resting on the table.\" This means that the book is not necessarily resting on the table.\n\n3. If the book is not resting on the table, and it must be either on the shelf or on the table, then the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes"
