This means that the notebook is either in the drawer or on the nightstand, but not anywhere else.\n\n2) The second premise is \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\". This contradicts the second part of the first premise, which said the notebook \"must be sitting on the nightstand\".\n\n3) If the notebook is not on the nightstand, and it has to be either in the drawer or on the nightstand, then the only remaining option is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that \"The notebook is in the drawer\".\n\nAnswer: yes"

'The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.'\n\nStep 1: Understand the first statement.\nThe first statement is a disjunction, which means that either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand, but not both.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe second statement suggests that the notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.
