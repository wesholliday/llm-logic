The first premise is 'Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet'. This statement presents two possible mutually exclusive scenarios for the location of the jacket.\n\n2. The second premise is 'The jacket might not be hanging in the closet'. This statement suggests that the jacket is not necessarily hanging in the closet.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications of these premises:\n\n- If the jacket is not hanging in the closet (as per the second premise), then the only remaining possibility is that it is draped over the chair (as per the first premise).\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that 'The jacket is draped over the chair'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
