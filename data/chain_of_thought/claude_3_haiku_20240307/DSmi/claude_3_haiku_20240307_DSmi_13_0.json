The first statement is: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n3. From the first statement, we know that the toy must be either in the toy box or on the bookshelf. There are no other possibilities.\n4. The second statement tells us that the toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf. This means that the toy is not necessarily on the bookshelf.\n5. If the toy is not on the bookshelf, and it must be either in the toy box or on the bookshelf, then the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
