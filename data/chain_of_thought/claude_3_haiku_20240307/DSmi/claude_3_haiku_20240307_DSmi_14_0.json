The first premise is: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n2. The second premise is: \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\n3. From the first premise, we know that the milk is either on the counter or in the fridge.\n4. The second premise tells us that the milk might not be in the fridge.\n5.
