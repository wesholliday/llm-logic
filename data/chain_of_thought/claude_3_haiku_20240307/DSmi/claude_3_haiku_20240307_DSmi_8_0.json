The first statement is \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\" This means that the remote control is either on the coffee table or under the couch, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\" This means that it is possible that the remote control is not under the couch.\n\n3. If the remote control is not under the couch, and it must be either on the coffee table or under the couch, then the only remaining possibility is that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
