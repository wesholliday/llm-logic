The first statement is \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\" This is a logical disjunction, which means that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\" This statement suggests that the possibility of the sunglasses being perched on her head is not definite, which means that the sunglasses are not necessarily perched on her head.\n\n3. Now, considering the first statement and the second statement together, we can infer that if the sunglasses are not perched on her head, then they must be in her bag. This is because the first statement tells us that the sunglasses are either in her bag or perched on her head, and the second statement tells us that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"

The second statement is: \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\"\n4. This second statement contradicts the second part of the first statement, which said the sunglasses \"must be perched on her head.\" If the sunglasses might not be perched on her head, then they cannot \"must be\" perched on her head.\n5.
