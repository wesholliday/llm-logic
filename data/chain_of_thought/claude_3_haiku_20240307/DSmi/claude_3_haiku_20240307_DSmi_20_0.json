            "content": "To answer this question, let's break down the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The first statement is \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\" This is an \"either-or\" statement, which means that the sunglasses must be in one of the two locations: either in her bag or perched on her head.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\" This statement suggests that the sunglasses are not necessarily perched on her head.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these two statements:\n- If the sunglasses are not perched on her head (as stated in the second statement), and they must be either in her bag or perched on her head (as stated in the first statement), then the only remaining possibility is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
