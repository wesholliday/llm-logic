'Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack'\n2. 'The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack'\n\nThe first statement is a logical disjunction, meaning that either the scarf is stuffed in the backpack or it is draped on the coat rack, but not both.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the scarf might not be draped on the coat rack. This means that it is possible that the scarf is not draped on the coat rack.\n\nNow, if the scarf might not be draped on the coat rack, and it must either be in the backpack or on the coat rack, then the only remaining possibility is that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that 'The scarf is stuffed in my backpack'.\n\nAnswer: yes"

The first premise is 'Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack'. This is an exclusive disjunction, meaning that one of the two possibilities must be true, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is 'The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack'. This implies that the scarf is not definitely on the coat rack.\n\n3. Combining the two premises, we can conclude that if the scarf is not draped on the coat rack, then it must be stuffed in the backpack. This is because the first premise states that the scarf is either in the backpack or on the coat rack, and the second premise eliminates the possibility of it being on the coat rack.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that 'The scarf is stuffed in my backpack'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
