The first premise is: \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed.\"\n2. The second premise is: \"The missing sock might not be under the bed.\"\n3. From the first premise, we know that the missing sock is either in the laundry basket or under the bed.\n4. The second premise tells us that the missing sock might not be under the bed.\n5. If the missing sock might not be under the bed, then the only other possibility from the first premise is that it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes"
