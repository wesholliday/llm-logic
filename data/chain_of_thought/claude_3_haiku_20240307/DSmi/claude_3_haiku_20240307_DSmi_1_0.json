The first premise is \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\" This means that Fido is either inside or in the garden, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" This means that it is possible that Fido is not in the garden.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the two possibilities:\n   a) If Fido is not in the garden, then the only other option is that Fido is inside, based on the first premise.\n   b) If Fido is in the garden, then the second premise contradicts this, as it states that Fido might not be in the garden.\n\n4. Therefore, the only logical conclusion that can be drawn from the given premises is that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
