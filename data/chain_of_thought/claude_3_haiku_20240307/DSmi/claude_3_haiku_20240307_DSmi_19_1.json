'Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist': This statement presents two mutually exclusive possibilities for the location of the watch.\n\n2. 'The watch might not be on his wrist': This statement suggests that the watch is not necessarily on the person's wrist.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical inference:\nIf the watch is not on the person's wrist (as stated in the second premise), and the watch must either be charging on the dresser or on the person's wrist (as stated in the first premise), then the only remaining possibility is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes"
