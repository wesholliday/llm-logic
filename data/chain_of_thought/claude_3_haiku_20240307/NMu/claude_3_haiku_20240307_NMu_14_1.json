This statement does not directly imply that the milk might not be on the counter, but rather that it is not necessary for the milk to be on the counter.\n\nHowever, the proposed inference, \"The milk might not be on the counter,\" is a possibility statement, which means that it is possible for the milk to not be on the counter.\n\nTo determine if we can infer the possibility statement from the given statement, we need to consider the logical relationship between the necessity and possibility of an event.\n\nIf it is not the case that the milk must be on the counter, it logically follows that it is possible for the milk to not be on the counter.
