This means that it is not a requirement or necessity for Alex to have finished the race.\n\nThe statement 'Alex might not have finished the race' is logically weaker than 'It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race'. If it is not necessary for Alex to have finished the race, then it is possible that he might not have finished the race.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'Alex might not have finished the race' from the statement 'It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
