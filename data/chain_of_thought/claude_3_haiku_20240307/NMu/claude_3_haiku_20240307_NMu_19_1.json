In other words, it's saying that it's not necessary for the watch to be charging on the dresser.\n\nThe statement that needs to be inferred is: \"The watch might not be charging on the dresser.\"\n\nThis statement suggests that it's possible for the watch to not be charging on the dresser.\n\nNow, let's examine the logical relationship between the given statement and the statement that needs to be inferred.\n\nIf it's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser, then it's possible that the watch might not be charging on the dresser.
