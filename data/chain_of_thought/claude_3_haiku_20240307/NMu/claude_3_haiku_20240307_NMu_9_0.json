            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt' from the statement 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe statement 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt' is a negation of the statement 'Lisa must have bought the red shirt'. This means that it is not necessarily true that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n\nIf it is not necessarily true that Lisa must have bought the red shirt, then it is possible that she might not have bought the red shirt. The statement 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt' is a weaker statement than 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt', as it allows for the possibility that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt' from the statement 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
