The statement 'It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box' is logically equivalent to 'The toy might not be in the toy box'.\n\n2. This is because the statement 'The toy must be in the toy box' is a strong claim, and the negation of this claim is 'The toy might not be in the toy box'.\n\n3.
