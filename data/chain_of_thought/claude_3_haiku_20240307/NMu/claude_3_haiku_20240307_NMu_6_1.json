In other words, it means that it is not required or obligatory for Sue to have chosen pizza.\n\nThe proposed inference is \"Sue might not have chosen pizza.\" This statement suggests that it is possible that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nTo determine if the proposed inference can be drawn from the given statement, we need to consider the logical implications.\n\nThe negation of a necessity (\"must have\") does not necessarily imply the possibility of the opposite (\"might not have\"). The statement \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" only means that it is not required for Sue to have chosen pizza, but it does not necessarily mean that Sue might not have chosen pizza.\n\nTherefore, the proposed inference \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" cannot be directly inferred from the given statement \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\"\n\nAnswer: no"

This means that the premise is true if and only if it is not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\n\nNow, the conclusion \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" is the same as saying \"It's possible that Sue did not choose pizza\".
