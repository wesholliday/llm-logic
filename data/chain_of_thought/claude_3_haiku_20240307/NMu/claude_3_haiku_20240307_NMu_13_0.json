This statement is logically equivalent to saying that the toy may or may not be in the toy box.\n\nIf the toy may or may not be in the toy box, then it is possible that the toy is not in the toy box. This is the same as saying 'The toy might not be in the toy box'.\n\nTherefore, from the given statement 'It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box', we can infer 'The toy might not be in the toy box'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
