This means that the original statement is denying the necessity of the jacket being draped over the chair.\n\nNow, the question is whether we can infer \"The jacket might not be draped over the chair\" from the original statement.\n\nThe statement \"The jacket might not be draped over the chair\" is a weaker claim than the original statement. It suggests that the jacket is not necessarily draped over the chair, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that it might be.\n\nSince the original statement denies the necessity of the jacket being draped over the chair, it logically follows that the jacket might not be draped over the chair. In other words, the original statement is sufficient to infer the weaker claim.\n\nAnswer: yes"
