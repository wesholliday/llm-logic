This means that it is not necessarily true that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nNow, the statement 'The watch might not be charging on the dresser' is the logical opposite of 'The watch must be charging on the dresser'. Since the original statement negates the necessity of the watch being on the dresser, it follows that the watch might not be charging on the dresser.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The watch might not be charging on the dresser' from the given statement 'It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
