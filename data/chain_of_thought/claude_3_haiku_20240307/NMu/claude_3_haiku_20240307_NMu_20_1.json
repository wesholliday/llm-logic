The statement 'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag' means that it is not necessary or required for the sunglasses to be in her bag. In other words, it is possible for the sunglasses to not be in her bag.\n\n2. If it is possible for the sunglasses to not be in her bag, then we can infer that the sunglasses 'might not be in her bag'. The word 'might' expresses a possibility or likelihood, which is consistent with the original statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the reasoning above, we can infer that 'The sunglasses might not be in her bag' from the original statement 'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
