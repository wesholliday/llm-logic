In other words, it is not the case that Mary's presence at the wedding is a certainty or an obligation.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that it is possible that Mary might not have been at the wedding. If it is not the case that Mary must have been there, then it is also possible that she might not have been there.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
