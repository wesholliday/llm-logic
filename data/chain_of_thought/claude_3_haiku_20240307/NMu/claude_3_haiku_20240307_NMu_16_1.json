The statement 'It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag' means that it is not necessary or required for the pen to be in the bag. In other words, it is not the case that the pen is definitely in the bag.\n\n2. If it is not the case that the pen must be in the bag, then it is possible that the pen might not be in the bag. This is because the absence of a requirement for the pen to be in the bag leaves open the possibility that the pen might not be in the bag.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The pen might not be in my bag'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
