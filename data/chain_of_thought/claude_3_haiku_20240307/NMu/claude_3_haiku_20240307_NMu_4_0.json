This means that the original statement is saying that it is not necessary or required for the alien to have visited Mars.\n\nNow, the statement 'The alien might not have visited Mars' is the logical opposite of 'The alien must have visited Mars'. If the original statement is true, then it is possible that the alien might not have visited Mars.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The alien might not have visited Mars' from the statement 'It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
