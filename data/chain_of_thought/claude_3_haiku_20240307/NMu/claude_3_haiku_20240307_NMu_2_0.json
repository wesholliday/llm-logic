In other words, it is not the case that the griffin was definitely in the forest.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the griffin might not have been in the forest. If it is not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest, then it is possible that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
