            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'Sue might not have chosen pizza' from 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe statement 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza' is logically equivalent to 'It's not necessary that Sue chose pizza' or 'Sue might not have chosen pizza'.\n\nThis is because the negation of a necessity statement ('must have') is a possibility statement ('might not have').\n\nTherefore, the original statement 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza' directly implies 'Sue might not have chosen pizza'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
