In other words, it is not the case that Jeff is obligated or compelled to have played basketball.\n\nThis statement does not directly imply that Jeff did not play basketball. It only suggests that it is not a certainty that he played basketball. The statement leaves open the possibility that Jeff might have played basketball or might not have played basketball.\n\nTherefore, from the given statement, we can infer that 'Jeff might not have played basketball'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
