This means that the original statement suggests that it is not necessary for the shoes to be in the closet.\n\nNow, if it is not necessary for the shoes to be in the closet, it implies that the shoes might not be in the closet. This is because the original statement does not specify the location of the shoes, it only states that they do not necessarily have to be in the closet.\n\nTherefore, we can infer from the given statement 'It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet' that 'The shoes might not be in the closet'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
