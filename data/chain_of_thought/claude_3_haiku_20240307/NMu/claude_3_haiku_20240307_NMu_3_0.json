This is because the negation of a necessity statement ('must have been written by James') is a possibility statement ('might not have been written by James').\n\nTherefore, the statement 'The book might not have been written by James' can be directly inferred from the given statement 'It's not the case that the book must have been written by James'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
