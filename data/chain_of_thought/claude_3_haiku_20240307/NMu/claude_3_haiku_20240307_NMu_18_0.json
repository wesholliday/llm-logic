In other words, it is not the case that the notebook is definitely in the drawer.\n\nThis statement does not explicitly state that the notebook is not in the drawer. It only suggests that the notebook's location in the drawer is not a certainty.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the notebook 'might not be in the drawer', as the statement leaves open the possibility that the notebook could be somewhere else.\n\nAnswer: yes"
