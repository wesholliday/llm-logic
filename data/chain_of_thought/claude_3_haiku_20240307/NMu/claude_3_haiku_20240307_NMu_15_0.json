This means that the original statement is saying that it is not necessary for the shoes to be in the closet.\n\nThe statement 'The shoes might not be in the closet' is a weaker claim than 'It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet'. If it is not the case that the shoes must be in the closet, then it is possible that the shoes might not be in the closet.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The shoes might not be in the closet' from 'It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
