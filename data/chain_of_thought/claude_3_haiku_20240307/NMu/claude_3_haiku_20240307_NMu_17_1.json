This statement is the negation of the proposition \"The scarf must be stuffed in my backpack\".\n\nThe proposed inference is \"The scarf might not be stuffed in my backpack\". This statement is the negation of the proposition \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack\".\n\nNow, let's examine the logical relationship between the given statement and the proposed inference.\n\nThe negation of \"The scarf must be stuffed in my backpack\" is logically equivalent to \"The scarf might not be stuffed in my backpack\". This is because \"must\" and \"might not\" are logical opposites.\n\nTherefore, from the given statement \"It's not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack\", we can infer \"The scarf might not be stuffed in my backpack\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
