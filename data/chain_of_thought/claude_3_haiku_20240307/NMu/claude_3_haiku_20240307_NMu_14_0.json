            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'The milk might not be on the counter' from 'It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe statement 'It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter' is logically equivalent to 'The milk might not be on the counter'. This is because the phrase 'must be on the counter' implies that the milk is necessarily on the counter, and the negation of this statement ('It's not the case that...') means that the milk is not necessarily on the counter, which is the same as saying that the milk might not be on the counter.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The milk might not be on the counter' from 'It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
