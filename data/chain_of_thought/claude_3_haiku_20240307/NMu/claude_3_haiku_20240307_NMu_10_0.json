This means that the original statement is denying the necessity of the dog being inside.\n\nNow, the statement 'The dog might not have been inside' is the logical opposite of 'The dog must have been inside'. If the necessity of the dog being inside is denied, then the possibility of the dog not being inside can be inferred.\n\nTherefore, from the statement 'It's not the case that the dog must have been inside', we can infer 'The dog might not have been inside'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
