This statement does not necessarily imply that the griffin was not in the forest, but rather that it is not certain or mandatory that the griffin was in the forest.\n\nIf the griffin was not required to be in the forest, then it is possible that the griffin might not have been in the forest. The statement 'It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest' leaves open the possibility that the griffin might not have been in the forest.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The griffin might not have been in the forest'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
