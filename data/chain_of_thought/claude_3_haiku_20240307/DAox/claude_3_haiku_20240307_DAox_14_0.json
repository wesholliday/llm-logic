We are given the statement 'The clug was not fleeked'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged'.\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that if the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged.\n4. This is because the second statement is a conditional statement, and the negation of the antecedent (the clug was not fleeked) implies the negation of the consequent (the clug was not snugged).\n\nAnswer: yes"
