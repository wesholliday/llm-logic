We are given the statement 'The sprocket was not cranked'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled'.\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that if the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled.\n4. This is because the second statement is a conditional statement, and the negation of the antecedent (the sprocket was not cranked) implies the negation of the consequent (the sprocket was not daggled).\n\nAnswer: yes"
