We are given the statement 'The smonk was not vreebled'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged'.\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that if the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged.\n4. Since we know from the first statement that 'The smonk was not vreebled', we can conclude that 'The smonk was not plagged'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
