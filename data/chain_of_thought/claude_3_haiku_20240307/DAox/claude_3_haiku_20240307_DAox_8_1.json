The question is asking whether we can infer from these two premises that 'The sprocket was not daggled'.\n4. To determine this, we can use the logical principle of modus tollens.\n5. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement of the form 'If P, then Q', and we have the negation of the conclusion (not Q), then we can infer the negation of the premise (not P).\n6. In this case, the conditional statement is 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled'.\n7. The negation of the conclusion is 'The sprocket was not daggled'.\n8.
