'The smip was not shripped' - This is a statement about the state of the smip, indicating that it was not shripped.\n\n2. 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint' - This is a conditional statement, which means that if the smip was shripped, then it would have lupped the zoint.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the smip was not shripped. This means that the condition in the second statement is not true, as the smip was not shripped.\n\nWhen the condition in a conditional statement is not true, we can infer that the conclusion of the statement is also not true.
