When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the entire conditional statement is true.\n\nStep 3: Determine the conclusion.\nSince the conditional statement is true, and the antecedent is false, the consequent (\"the sneg sproted the frink\") must also be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The sneg did not sprot the frink\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
