We are given the statement 'The wug did not floop'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint'.\n3. From the first statement, we know that the wug did not floop.\n4. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\n5. Since we know the wug did not floop, the condition 'if the wug was flooped' is not met.\n6. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the wug bimmed the zoint.\n7. In other words, we can infer that 'The wug did not bim the zoint'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
