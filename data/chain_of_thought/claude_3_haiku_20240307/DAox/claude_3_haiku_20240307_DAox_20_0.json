The first statement tells us that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n3. However, since the fleeg was not bluttered (from the first statement), the condition in the second statement is not met. This means that the conclusion \"the fleeg surned\" does not necessarily follow.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The fleeg did not surn\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
