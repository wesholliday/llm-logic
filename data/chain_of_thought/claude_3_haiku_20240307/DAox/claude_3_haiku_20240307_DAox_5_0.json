We are given the statement 'The zinger was not fraggled'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the zinger was fraggled, then it was also smoogled.\n4. Since we know from the first statement that 'The zinger was not fraggled', we can infer that the condition 'If the zinger was fraggled' is not true.\n5. If the condition 'If the zinger was fraggled' is not true, then the conclusion 'then the zinger was smoogled' must also be false.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that 'The zinger was not smoogled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
