We are given the statement 'The dreb was not vroombed'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened'.\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that if the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened.\n4. This is because the second statement is a conditional statement, and the negation of the antecedent (the dreb was not vroombed) implies the negation of the consequent (the dreb was not spened).\n\nAnswer: yes"
