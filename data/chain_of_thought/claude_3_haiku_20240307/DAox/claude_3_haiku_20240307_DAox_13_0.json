We are given the statement 'The glip was not slogged'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged'.\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\n4. Since the first statement tells us that the glip was not slogged, we can conclude that the condition in the second statement is not met.\n5. If the condition 'the glip was slogged' is not met, then the conclusion 'the glip was tragged' does not necessarily follow.\n6. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The glip was not tragged' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
