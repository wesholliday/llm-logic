From the first statement, we know that the grommet did not sploff.\n4. The second statement is a conditional statement. It says that if the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\n5. Since we know the grommet did not sploff, the antecedent of the conditional statement is false. This means the consequent, 'the grommet plopped the frink', is also false.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that 'The grommet did not plop the frink'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
