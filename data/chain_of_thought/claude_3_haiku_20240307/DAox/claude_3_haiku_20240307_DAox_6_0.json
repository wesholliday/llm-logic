We are given the statement 'The grommet did not sploff'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink'.\n3. From the first statement, we know that the grommet did not sploff.\n4. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\n5. Since we know the grommet did not sploff, the condition in the second statement is not met. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the grommet plopped the frink.\n6. If the grommet did not plop the frink, then we can infer 'The grommet did not plop the frink'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
