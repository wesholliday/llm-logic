We are given the statement 'The splat was not morphed'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked'.\n3. From the first statement, we know that the splat was not morphed.\n4. Since the splat was not morphed, the condition in the second statement is not met.\n5. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the splat quanked.\n6. In other words, we can infer 'The splat did not quank'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
