We are given the statement 'The flob was not skizzled'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated'.\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that if the flob was not skizzled, then the flob was not movated.\n4. This is because the second statement is a conditional statement, and the negation of the consequent (the flob movated) implies the negation of the antecedent (the flob was skizzled).\n5. Therefore, from the given information, we can infer 'The flob was not movated'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
