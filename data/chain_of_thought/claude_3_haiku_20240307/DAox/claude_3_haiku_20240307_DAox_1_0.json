If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\n\nTo infer 'The flugel was not zargled', we need to use the rule of modus tollens.\n\nThe rule of modus tollens states that if we have the premise 'If P, then Q' and the premise 'not Q', then we can infer 'not P'.\n\nIn this case, we have the premise 'If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled' and the premise 'The flugel was not blimmed'. Using the rule of modus tollens, we can infer 'The flugel was not zargled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
