We are given the statement 'The wug was not sproinged'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled'.\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that if the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled.\n4. This is because the second statement is a conditional statement, and the negation of the antecedent (the wug was not sproinged) implies the negation of the consequent (the wug was not garpled).\n\nAnswer: yes"
