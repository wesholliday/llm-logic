The first statement is: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Also, the alien did not visit Mars.\" This contradicts the first statement, which said that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n\n3. Given the two statements, we can infer that the robot did not necessarily visit Jupiter, even though the first statement suggested that the robot would visit Jupiter if the alien visited Mars.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no"
