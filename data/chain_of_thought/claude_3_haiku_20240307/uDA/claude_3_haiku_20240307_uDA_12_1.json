Joe did not go to the park.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can conclude that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would have gone to the zoo. However, since the second statement tells us that Joe did not go to the park, we cannot infer anything about Lucy's actions.\n\nThe fact that Joe did not go to the park does not necessarily mean that Lucy did not go to the zoo. It is possible that Lucy still went to the zoo, even though Joe did not go to the park.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
