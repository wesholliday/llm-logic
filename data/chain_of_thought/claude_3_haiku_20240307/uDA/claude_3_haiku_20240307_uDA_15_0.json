The first statement is: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Sam took a plane) is true, then the second part (Erin took a train) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Sam did not take a plane.\" This means that the first part of the conditional statement is false.\n\n3. When the first part of a conditional statement is false, the entire statement becomes true. In other words, even though we don't know if Erin took a train or not, the conditional statement is still true.\n\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer that Erin did not take a train. The information given is not sufficient to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
