Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis. This is because the statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If A, then B.\" If the antecedent (A) is false, then the consequent (B) can be either true or false.\n\nNow, given that Jeff did not play basketball (statement 2), we can apply the first statement and conclude that Amy did not play tennis.\n\nAnswer: no"
