The cake was not chocolate.\n\nFrom the second statement, we can infer that the first part of the first statement is false (the cake was not chocolate). \n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that the second part of the first statement is also false (the muffins were not blueberry). The first statement is a conditional statement, and the truth of the conclusion (the muffins were blueberry) does not depend on the truth of the antecedent (the cake was chocolate).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nAnswer: no"
