The second statement is: \"Also, the book was not written by James.\"\n3. The question is asking whether we can infer that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's apply the logic:\n* If the book was written by James, then it would be a mystery novel (according to the first statement).\n* However, the second statement tells us that the book was not written by James.\n* Therefore, we cannot infer that the book is a mystery novel, since the condition \"if the book was written by James\" is not met.\n\nAnswer: yes"
