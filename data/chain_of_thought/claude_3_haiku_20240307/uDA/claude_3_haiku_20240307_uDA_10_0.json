The first statement is: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This means that if the dog was inside, the cat must have been outside.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The dog was not inside.\" This means that the dog was not inside, so the condition in the first statement is not met.\n\n3. Since the condition in the first statement is not met (the dog was not inside), we cannot infer anything about the location of the cat. The cat could be either inside or outside.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the cat was not outside.\n\nAnswer: no"
