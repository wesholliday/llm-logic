The first statement is: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Tom watching football) is true, then the second part (Jen watching basketball) is also true.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Tom did not watch football.\" This means that the first part of the conditional statement is false.\n\n3. When the first part of a conditional statement is false, the entire statement is considered to be true. In other words, the statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is true, even though Tom did not watch football.\n\n4. However, the truth of the conditional statement does not necessarily imply that the second part (Jen watched basketball) is also true. It only means that if the first part were true, then the second part would also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: no"
