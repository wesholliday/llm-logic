This means that if the condition (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the conclusion (Bob chose pasta) must also be true.\n\n2) However, the second statement says \"Sue did not choose pizza\". This means the condition in the first statement is false.\n\n3) When the condition in a conditional statement is false, the conclusion can be either true or false.
