However, it does not tell us anything about what happens if the apple is not red.\n2) The second statement is \"Also, the apple was not red.\" This tells us that the condition in the first statement is not met, i.e., the apple was not red.\n3) Since the condition in the first statement is not met, we cannot conclude anything about the color of the banana.

However, the second statement tells us that the apple was not red.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n- If the apple was not red, we cannot infer anything about the color of the banana.
