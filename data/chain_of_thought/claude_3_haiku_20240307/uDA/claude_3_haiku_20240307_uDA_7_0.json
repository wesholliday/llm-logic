The first statement is: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This means that if Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished the race.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Alex did not finish the race.\" This means that Alex did not complete the race.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the implications of these two statements:\n   - If Alex did not finish the race, then the first statement (\"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\") is false. This means that we cannot infer anything about whether Chris finished the race or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: no"
