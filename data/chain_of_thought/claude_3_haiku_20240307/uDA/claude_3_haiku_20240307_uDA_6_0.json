The first statement is: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. However, this does not necessarily mean that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Sue did not choose pizza.\" This means that the condition in the first statement is not true, i.e., Sue did not choose pizza.\n\n3. From the first statement, we know that if the condition (Sue chose pizza) is not true, then we cannot infer anything about Bob's choice. In other words, just because Sue did not choose pizza, we cannot conclude that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: no"
