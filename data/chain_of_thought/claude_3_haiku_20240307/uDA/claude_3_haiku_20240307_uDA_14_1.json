This means that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\n\n2. The next statement says \"the bear was not in the cave\". This means that the condition in the first statement is not true - the bear was not in the cave.\n\n3. When the condition of a conditional statement is not true, we cannot infer anything about the conclusion. In other words, just because the bear was not in the cave, we cannot conclude that the wolf was not in the den.\n\nAnswer: no"
