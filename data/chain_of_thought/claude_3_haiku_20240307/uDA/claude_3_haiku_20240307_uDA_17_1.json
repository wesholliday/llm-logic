It does not necessarily mean that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad.\n2) The second statement is \"Ben did not eat pasta.\" This means that the condition in the first statement is not true (Ben did not eat pasta).\n3) Since the condition in the first statement is not true, we cannot infer anything about whether Kate ate salad or not. The first statement only tells us what happens if Ben ate pasta, but it does not tell us what happens if Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: no"
