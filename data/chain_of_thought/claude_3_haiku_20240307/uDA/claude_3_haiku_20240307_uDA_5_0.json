Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the consequence (Amy playing tennis) is also true.\n\nHowever, the second statement tells us that the condition (Jeff playing basketball) is false. This means that the consequence (Amy playing tennis) may or may not be true.\n\nIn other words, the fact that Jeff did not play basketball does not necessarily imply that Amy did not play tennis. The first statement only tells us that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis, but it does not tell us anything about the case where Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Amy did not play tennis based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
