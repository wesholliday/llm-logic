The first statement is: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This means that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The vampire was not awake.\" This means that the vampire was not in an awake state.\n\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer that the mummy was not awake.\n\nSince the first statement says that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake, and the second statement says that the vampire was not awake, we can conclude that the mummy was also not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes"
