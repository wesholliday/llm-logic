The first statement is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue must have also attended the wedding.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" This means that Mary did not attend the wedding.\n\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer that Sue was not at the wedding. Since the first statement says that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding, and the second statement says that Mary was not at the wedding, we can conclude that Sue was also not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes"
