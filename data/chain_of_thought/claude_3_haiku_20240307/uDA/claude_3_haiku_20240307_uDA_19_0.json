            "content": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the given information and the logical implications.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This means that if the condition \"Tom watched football\" is true, then the conclusion \"Jen watched basketball\" must also be true.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the condition \"Tom watched football\" is false, i.e., Tom did not watch football.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n1. If the condition \"Tom watched football\" is false, then the conclusion \"Jen watched basketball\" does not necessarily have to be true. The conditional statement only tells us that if the condition is true, then the conclusion is true, but it does not work the other way around.\n2. Since we cannot infer anything about the truth of the conclusion \"Jen watched basketball\" from the given information, we also cannot infer that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: no"
