The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This means that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. However, this does not tell us anything about the actual color of the car or the truck.\n\n2. The second statement tells us that \"the car was not red.\" This means that the car was not red.\n\n3. Now, we need to consider the implications of the first and second statements. Since the car was not red, the condition of the first statement is not met.
