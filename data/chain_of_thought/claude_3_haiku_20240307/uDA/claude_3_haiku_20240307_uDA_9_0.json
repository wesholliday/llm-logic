            "content": "To answer this question, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. The first statement is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" This means that the first part of the conditional statement is false.\n\n3. When the first part of a conditional statement is false, the entire statement becomes true. In other words, even though we don't know if Mark bought the blue shirt, we can infer that the statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true.\n\n4. However, this does not necessarily mean that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. The second part of the conditional statement (Mark buying the blue shirt) could still be true, even though the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt) is false.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: no"
