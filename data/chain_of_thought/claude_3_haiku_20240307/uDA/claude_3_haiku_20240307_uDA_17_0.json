Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nTo infer whether Kate did not eat salad, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This means that if the condition (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the consequence (Kate ate salad) must also be true.\n\nHowever, the second statement tells us that the condition (Ben ate pasta) is not true. This means that the consequence (Kate ate salad) may or may not be true.\n\nIn other words, the fact that Ben did not eat pasta does not necessarily imply that Kate did not eat salad. The first statement only tells us that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad, but it does not provide any information about what Kate did if Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Kate did not eat salad based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
