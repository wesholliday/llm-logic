The first premise states that either P or Q is true (the newspaper is in the driveway or it is sitting on the porch).\n2. The second premise tells us that Q is false (the newspaper is not sitting on the porch).\n3. Given that either P or Q is true, and Q is false, the only remaining possibility is that P is true (the newspaper is in the driveway).\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
