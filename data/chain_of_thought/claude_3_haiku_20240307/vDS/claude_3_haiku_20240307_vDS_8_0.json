            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following structure:\n\nPremise 1: Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch.\nPremise 2: The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\nConclusion: The remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nLet's think through the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The first premise states that the remote control is either on the coffee table or hiding under the couch. This means that the remote control must be in one of these two locations.\n\n2. The second premise tells us that the remote control is not hiding under the couch. This eliminates one of the possible locations mentioned in the first premise.\n\n3. Since the remote control is not hiding under the couch, and the first premise states that it must be either on the coffee table or under the couch, the only remaining possibility is that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that the remote control is on the coffee table follows necessarily from the given premises. This form of argument is known as a disjunctive syllogism, and it is a logically valid form of reasoning.\n\nAnswer: yes"
