            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following structure:\nPremise 1: Either A or B\nPremise 2: Not B\nConclusion: A\n\nThis structure is known as the disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid form of argument.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n1. The first premise states that either the newspaper is in the driveway (A) or it is sitting on the porch (B).\n2. The second premise tells us that the newspaper is not sitting on the porch (not B).\n3. Given the first premise and the fact that the newspaper is not sitting on the porch (not B), the only remaining possibility is that the newspaper is in the driveway (A).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that the newspaper is in the driveway follows necessarily from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
