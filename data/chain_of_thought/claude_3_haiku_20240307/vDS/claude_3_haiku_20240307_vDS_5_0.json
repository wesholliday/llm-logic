            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following structure:\nPremise 1: Either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry.\nPremise 2: The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry.\nConclusion: The cookies are in the jar.\n\nThis argument form is known as a disjunctive syllogism. The logical validity of a disjunctive syllogism can be evaluated as follows:\n\n1. The first premise is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true.\n2. The second premise denies one of the disjuncts (the cookies are hidden in the pantry).\n3. Therefore, the remaining disjunct must be true (the cookies are in the jar).\n\nSince the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
