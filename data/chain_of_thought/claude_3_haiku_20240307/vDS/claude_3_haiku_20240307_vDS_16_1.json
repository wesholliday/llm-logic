The second premise is the negation of the second part of the disjunction, i.e., the pen is not on the desk. The conclusion is that the pen is in the bag.\n\nThis form of argument is known as a disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid form of logical reasoning. The reasoning can be outlined as follows:\n\n1. Either A or B (first premise)\n2. Not B (second premise)\n3. Therefore, A (conclusion)\n\nSince the logical form of the argument is valid, the argument itself is also logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"

This negates one of the possibilities from the first premise.\n\nThe conclusion is \"The pen is in my bag\". This concludes the other possibility from the first premise.\n\nThis form of argument is known as Disjunctive Syllogism.
