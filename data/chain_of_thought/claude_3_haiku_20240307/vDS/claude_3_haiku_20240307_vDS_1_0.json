            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following structure:\nPremise 1: Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden.\nPremise 2: Fido is not in the garden.\nConclusion: Fido is inside.\n\nThe key to analyzing the validity of this argument is the logical rule of disjunctive syllogism. The rule of disjunctive syllogism states that if we have a disjunction (either/or statement) as the first premise and the negation of one of the disjuncts as the second premise, then we can validly conclude the other disjunct.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is a disjunction: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden.\" The second premise is the negation of one of the disjuncts: \"Fido is not in the garden.\" Therefore, by the rule of disjunctive syllogism, we can validly conclude the other disjunct: \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
