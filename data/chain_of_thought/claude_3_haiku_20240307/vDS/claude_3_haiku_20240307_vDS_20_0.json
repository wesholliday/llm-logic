            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following structure:\nPremise 1: Either A or B\nPremise 2: Not B\nConclusion: Therefore, A\n\nThis structure is known as the disjunctive syllogism. The disjunctive syllogism is a valid form of argument, where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. The first premise states that either the sunglasses are in her bag (A) or they are perched on her head (B).\n2. The second premise tells us that the sunglasses are not perched on her head (not B).\n3. Given the first premise and the negation of the second part of the disjunction (not B), the conclusion that the sunglasses are in her bag (A) necessarily follows.\n\nAnswer: yes"
