            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following structure:\n\nPremise 1: Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it is hanging in the closet.\nPremise 2: The jacket isn't hanging in the closet.\nConclusion: The jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nThis argument form is known as a disjunctive syllogism. The logical validity of a disjunctive syllogism can be determined as follows:\n\n1. The first premise is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two options must be true.\n2. The second premise eliminates one of the options, leaving the other option as the only possible conclusion.\n\nIn this case, the first premise states that the jacket is either draped over the chair or hanging in the closet. The second premise eliminates the possibility that the jacket is hanging in the closet. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nGiven the structure of the argument, the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. Therefore, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
