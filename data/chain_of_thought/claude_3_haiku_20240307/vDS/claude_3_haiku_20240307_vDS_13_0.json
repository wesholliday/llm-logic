The second premise eliminates one of the possibilities by stating that the toy is not sitting on the shelf.\n\nGiven that the toy is not sitting on the shelf, and the only other possibility is that it is in the toy box, the conclusion that the toy is in the toy box necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
