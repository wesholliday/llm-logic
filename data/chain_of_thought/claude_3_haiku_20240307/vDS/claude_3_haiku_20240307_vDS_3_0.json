            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following structure:\nPremise 1: Either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet.\nPremise 2: The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet.\nConclusion: The keys are in the drawer.\n\nThis argument form is known as the disjunctive syllogism. The logical validity of this form can be evaluated as follows:\n\n1. The first premise is a disjunction, which means that either one of the two statements is true (the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet).\n2. The second premise negates one of the disjuncts (the keys aren't dangling in the cabinet).\n3. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the keys must be in the drawer.\n\nThis form of argument is logically valid because the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. If the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
