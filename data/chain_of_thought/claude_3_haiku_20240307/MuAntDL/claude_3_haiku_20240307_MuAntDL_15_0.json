The statement allows for the possibility that the password could have been longer than eight characters, as indicated by the \"or longer\" part of the statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from the given statement that \"The password must have been eight characters long.\" The statement only specifies the minimum length requirement, but does not preclude the possibility of the password being longer than eight characters.\n\nAnswer: no"
