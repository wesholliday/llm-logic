This statement does not necessarily imply that the movie was in English. It only states that the movie was either in English or subtitled, but it does not specify which one is true.\n\nTo infer that \"The movie must have been in English\" from the given statement, we would need additional information or a stronger premise that explicitly states the movie was in English. The given statement alone does not provide enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
