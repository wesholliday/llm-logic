            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been signed or notarized\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning that either one of the two conditions must be true for the statement to be true. This means that the document could have been signed, or it could have been notarized, or it could have been both signed and notarized.\n\nIf we infer from this statement that \"The document must have been signed,\" we are essentially saying that the document must have been signed, regardless of whether it was also notarized. This is a valid inference because if the document was signed, then the \"or notarized\" part of the original statement would still be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
