            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The event must have been formal' from the given statement 'The event must have been formal or semi-formal', we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe statement 'The event must have been formal or semi-formal' is a disjunction, which means that the event was either formal or semi-formal, or both. This statement does not specify whether the event was definitely formal, only that it was either formal or semi-formal.\n\nTo infer that 'The event must have been formal' from the given statement, we would need to be able to conclude that the event could not have been semi-formal, and that it must have been formal. However, the original statement does not provide enough information to make this inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
