However, the given statement does not provide enough information to do so. It simply states that the meeting was either at 2 PM or cancelled, without specifying which of the two possibilities is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM\" from the given statement. The most we can conclude is that the meeting was either at 2 PM or cancelled, but we cannot determine which of the two is the case.\n\nAnswer: no"
