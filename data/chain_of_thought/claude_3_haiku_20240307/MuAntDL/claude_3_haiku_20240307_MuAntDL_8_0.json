This statement does not provide enough information to determine which of the two possibilities is true.\n\nTo infer that \"The restaurant must have been closed on Monday,\" we would need to have additional information that eliminates the possibility of the restaurant being open for limited hours on Monday. Without such additional information, we cannot conclude that the restaurant was definitely closed on Monday.\n\nAnswer: no"
