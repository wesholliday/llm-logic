            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The package must have been delivered yesterday or the day before\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning that one of the two possibilities is true, but we don't know which one. \n\nTo infer that \"The package must have been delivered yesterday\" from this statement, we would need to eliminate the possibility that the package was delivered the day before. However, the original statement does not provide enough information to do that. It simply states that the package was delivered either yesterday or the day before, without specifying which one is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The package must have been delivered yesterday\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
