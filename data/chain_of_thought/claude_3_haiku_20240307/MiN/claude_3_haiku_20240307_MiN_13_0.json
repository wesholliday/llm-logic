            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box' from the statement 'The toy might not be in the toy box', we need to consider the logical implications of the given statement.\n\nThe statement 'The toy might not be in the toy box' suggests that it is possible for the toy to not be in the toy box. This means that the toy's location in the toy box is not a certainty.\n\nNow, the statement 'It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box' is the negation of the statement 'The toy must be in the toy box'. This means that the toy's location in the toy box is not a necessity or requirement.\n\nSince the original statement 'The toy might not be in the toy box' implies that the toy's location in the toy box is not a certainty, we can infer that it is not the case that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
