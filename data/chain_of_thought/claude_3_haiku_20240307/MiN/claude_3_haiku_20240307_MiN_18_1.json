It suggests that the notebook may or may not be in the drawer, but it does not make a definitive claim.\n\nThe proposed inference, \"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer,\" is a negation of a necessity statement. This implies that it is not necessary for the notebook to be in the drawer.\n\nWhen we consider the relationship between the given statement and the proposed inference, we can see that the inference follows logically from the given statement.
