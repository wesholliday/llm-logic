            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt' from the statement 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt', we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe statement 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt' is a possibility statement, which means that it is possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This statement does not imply that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt' is a negation of the necessity statement 'Lisa must have bought the red shirt'. This means that it is not the case that Lisa was required to buy the red shirt.\n\nSince the possibility statement 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt' does not imply the necessity statement 'Lisa must have bought the red shirt', we can infer that the negation of the necessity statement, 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt', is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
