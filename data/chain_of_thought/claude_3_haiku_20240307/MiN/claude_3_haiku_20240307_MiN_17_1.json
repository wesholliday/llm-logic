This means that the scarf is not required to be in the backpack.\n\nThe original statement of possibility is weaker than the proposed inference of negating necessity. If the scarf might not be in the backpack, then it is also true that it is not necessary for the scarf to be in the backpack.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
