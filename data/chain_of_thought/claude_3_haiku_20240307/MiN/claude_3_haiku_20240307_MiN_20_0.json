This does not necessarily mean that the sunglasses must not be in her bag.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement 'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag' is a stronger statement that denies the necessity of the sunglasses being in her bag.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the stronger statement 'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag' from the weaker statement 'The sunglasses might not be in her bag'.\n\nAnswer: no"
