This statement does not imply that Sue must have chosen pizza, but rather that she might not have chosen it.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza' is a negation of the necessity statement 'Sue must have chosen pizza'. This means that it is not the case that Sue was required to choose pizza.\n\nSince the original statement 'Sue might not have chosen pizza' does not imply that Sue must have chosen pizza, we can infer that 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza' is a valid conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes"
