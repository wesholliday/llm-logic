This means that the sunglasses may or may not be in the bag.\n\nThe conclusion \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag\" implies that it is not necessary or obligatory for the sunglasses to be in the bag.\n\nSince the premise allows for the possibility that the sunglasses may not be in the bag, the conclusion follows logically from the premise. If the sunglasses might not be in the bag, then it is not the case that they must be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
