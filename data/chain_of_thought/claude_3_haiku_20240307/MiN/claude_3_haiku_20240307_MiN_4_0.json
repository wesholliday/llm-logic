This statement does not imply that the alien must have visited Mars.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement 'It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars' is a negation of the necessity statement 'The alien must have visited Mars'. This means that it is not the case that the alien is required to have visited Mars.\n\nSince the original statement 'The alien might not have visited Mars' does not imply the necessity of the alien visiting Mars, we can infer that 'It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars' is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
