This means that there is a chance that Alex did not finish the race, but it does not necessarily mean that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement 'It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race' means that it is not true that Alex definitely finished the race. This is a stronger statement than 'Alex might not have finished the race', as it directly contradicts the idea that Alex must have finished the race.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race' from the statement 'Alex might not have finished the race'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
