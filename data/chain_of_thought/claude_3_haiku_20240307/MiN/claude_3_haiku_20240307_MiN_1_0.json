            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding' from the statement 'Mary might not have been at the wedding', we need to consider the logical implications of these statements.\n\nThe statement 'Mary might not have been at the wedding' suggests that it is possible that Mary was not at the wedding, but it does not necessarily mean that she was not there. It leaves open the possibility that she might have been at the wedding.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding' means that it is not true that Mary was definitely at the wedding. This statement is the negation of the claim that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nSince the first statement, 'Mary might not have been at the wedding', does not rule out the possibility that Mary was at the wedding, we cannot infer the stronger statement 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding' from it.\n\nAnswer: no"
