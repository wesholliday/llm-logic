This means that there is a possibility that the book was written by someone else, or that the author is unknown.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement 'It's not the case that the book must have been written by James'. This statement implies that it is not necessary or required that the book was written by James. In other words, it is not the case that the book must have been written by James.\n\nComparing the two statements, we can see that the statement 'The book might not have been written by James' is logically weaker than the statement 'It's not the case that the book must have been written by James'. The former statement only suggests a possibility, while the latter statement makes a stronger claim about the necessity of the book being written by James.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that the book must have been written by James' from the statement 'The book might not have been written by James'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
