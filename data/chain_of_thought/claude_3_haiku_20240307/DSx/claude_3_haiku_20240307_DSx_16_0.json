The second statement is: \"The sneg is not sproted.\"\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that the sneg is not sproted.\n4. Going back to the first statement, we can see that there are two possibilities: either the sneg is crampled or it is sproted.\n5. Since we know from the second statement that the sneg is not sproted, the only remaining possibility is that the sneg is crampled.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The sneg is crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
