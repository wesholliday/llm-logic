This means that the glip must be either slogged or tragged, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is \"The glip is not tragged\". This means that the glip cannot be tragged.\n\n3. Since the glip cannot be tragged, and it must be either slogged or tragged, the only remaining possibility is that the glip is slogged.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that \"The glip is slogged\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
