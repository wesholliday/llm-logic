The first premise states 'Either the smonk is vreebled or it is plagged'. This means that the smonk must be either vreebled or plagged, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise states 'The smonk is not plagged'. This means that the smonk cannot be plagged, as it is explicitly stated that it is not plagged.\n\n3.
