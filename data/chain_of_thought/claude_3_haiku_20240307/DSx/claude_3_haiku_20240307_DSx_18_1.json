This is an exclusive or statement, meaning that the shank cannot be both plooked and nugged at the same time.\n\nThe second statement, \"The shank is not nugged,\" provides additional information. It tells us that the shank is not in the nugged state.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical reasoning:\n1. We know that the shank is either plooked or nugged (from the first statement).\n2. We also know that the shank is not nugged (from the second statement).\n3. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the shank must be plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
