If the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed, according to the first premise.\n2. If the grommet is not plopped, and it is not sploffed, then it would violate the first premise, which states that the grommet must be either sploffed or plopped.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that \"The grommet is sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
