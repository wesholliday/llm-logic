The first statement is 'Either the zinger is fraggled or it is smoogled'. This means that the zinger must be either fraggled or smoogled, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is 'The zinger is not smoogled'. This means that the zinger cannot be smoogled.\n\n3. Since the zinger cannot be smoogled, and it must be either fraggled or smoogled, the only remaining possibility is that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer 'The zinger is fraggled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
