This means that the smip must be either shripped or lupped, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The smip is not lupped\". This means that the smip cannot be lupped.\n\n3. From the first statement, we know that since the smip is not lupped, it must be shripped.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The smip is shripped\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
