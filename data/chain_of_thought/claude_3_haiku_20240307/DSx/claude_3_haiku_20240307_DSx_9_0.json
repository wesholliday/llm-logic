The first premise is \"Either the twonk is plinked or it is varnished.\" This means that the twonk must be either plinked or varnished, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is \"The twonk is not plinked.\" This means that the twonk cannot be plinked.\n\n3. Given the first premise, if the twonk is not plinked, then it must be varnished.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The twonk is varnished.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
