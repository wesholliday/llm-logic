This means that the whiffle must be either shanked or tinked, but not both.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The whiffle is not tinked\". This means that the whiffle cannot be tinked.\n\n3. Since the whiffle cannot be tinked (from the second statement), and it must be either shanked or tinked (from the first statement), the only remaining possibility is that the whiffle must be shanked.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"The whiffle is shanked\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
