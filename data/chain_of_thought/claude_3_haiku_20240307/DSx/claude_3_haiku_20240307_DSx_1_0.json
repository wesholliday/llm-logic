We are also given the statement: \"The flugel is not zargled.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the flugel is not zargled, then it must be blimmed.\n4. Since we know from the second statement that the flugel is not zargled, we can conclude that the flugel must be blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
