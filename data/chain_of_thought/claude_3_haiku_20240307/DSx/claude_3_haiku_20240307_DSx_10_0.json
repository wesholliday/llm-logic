This means that the wug must be either sproinged or garpled, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is \"The wug is not garpled\". This means that the wug cannot be garpled.\n\n3. Since the wug cannot be garpled, and it must be either sproinged or garpled, the only remaining possibility is that the wug is sproinged.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that \"The wug is sproinged\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
