We are also given the statement \"The fribble is not crinked\".\n3. From the first statement, we know that the fribble must be either snurgled or crinked.\n4. However, the second statement tells us that the fribble is not crinked.\n5. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
