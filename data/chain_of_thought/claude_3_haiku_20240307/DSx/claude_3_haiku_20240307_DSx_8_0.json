We are also given the statement \"The sprocket is not daggled\".\n3. From the first statement, we know that the sprocket must be either cranked or daggled.\n4. The second statement tells us that the sprocket is not daggled.\n5. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
