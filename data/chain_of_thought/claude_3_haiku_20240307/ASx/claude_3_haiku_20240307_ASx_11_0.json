It states that if the zibble is zapped, then the glorp will zoon. This means that the zapping of the zibble is a sufficient condition for the glorp to zoon.\n\nThe proposed inference 'If the zibble is zapped and the quib is squinked, then the glorp will zoon' is also a conditional statement. It states that if the zibble is zapped and the quib is squinked, then the glorp will zoon.\n\nIn this case, the additional condition of the quib being squinked has been added to the original statement. However, the original statement does not mention anything about the quib being squinked. Therefore, the additional condition is not necessary for the glorp to zoon.\n\nAnswer: yes"
