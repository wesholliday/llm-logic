It states that if the tizzer is on, then the goom is snurpled. This means that whenever the tizzer is on, the goom is snurpled, but it does not necessarily mean that the goom is snurpled only when the tizzer is on.\n\nThe proposed inference 'If the tizzer is on and the plink light is out, then the goom is snurpled' is also a conditional statement. It states that if the tizzer is on and the plink light is out, then the goom is snurpled.\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we need to consider the relationship between the original statement and the proposed inference. The proposed inference is a more specific case of the original statement, as it adds an additional condition (the plink light is out) to the antecedent (the tizzer is on).\n\nSince the original statement 'If the tizzer is on, then the goom is snurpled' is a broader statement that encompasses the proposed inference, we can conclude that the proposed inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
