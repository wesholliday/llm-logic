Specifically, we need to determine if the new statement is a logical consequence of the given statement.\n\nIn this case, the new statement is a stronger statement than the given statement, as it adds an additional condition (the blarf is twinkling) to the antecedent. If the quop is in the blarf and the blarf is twinkling, then it must also be true that the quop is in the blarf.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the new statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
