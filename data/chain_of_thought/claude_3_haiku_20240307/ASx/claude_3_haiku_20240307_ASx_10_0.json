This statement does not make any claims about the wuggy being out of zloat.\n\nTo infer the new statement, we would need to add the additional condition that the wuggy is out of zloat. This would create a stronger, more specific conditional statement.\n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide any information about the wuggy being out of zloat. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the new statement from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
