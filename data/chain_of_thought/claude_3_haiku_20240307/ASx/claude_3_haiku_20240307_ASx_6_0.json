In other words, the original consequence, \"it will hurt my snarfs,\" must still be true even if the additional condition, \"I am wearing plorks,\" is true.\n\nHowever, the information provided does not give any indication that the additional condition, \"I am wearing plorks,\" has any impact on the original consequence, \"it will hurt my snarfs.\" Therefore, we cannot infer that the proposed statement is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
