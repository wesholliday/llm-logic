This means that if the krimp is in the zool, then the snarf will be glonked. \n\nThe proposed inference adds an additional condition, \"and the zool is zapped\". This means that the new statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A and C, then B\".\n\nFor the new statement to be a valid inference, the original statement must imply the new statement. In other words, if the krimp is in the zool, then the snarf will be glonked, regardless of whether the zool is zapped or not.\n\nTherefore, the new statement can be inferred from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
