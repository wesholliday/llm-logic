Specifically, we need to determine if the new statement is a logical consequence of the given statement.\n\nIn this case, the new statement is a stronger statement than the given statement, as it adds an additional condition (the drib is flanked) to the antecedent. Therefore, if the given statement is true, the new statement must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
