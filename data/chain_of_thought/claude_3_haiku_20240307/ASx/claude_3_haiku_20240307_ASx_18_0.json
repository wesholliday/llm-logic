This means that if the condition A (the zonk is twiddled) is true, then the conclusion B (it will pluzzle) is also true.\n\nThe proposed inference adds an additional condition, \"and it is blorped\", to the original statement. This means that the new statement would be in the form \"If A and C, then B\".\n\nIn general, if a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is true, we can infer that \"If A and C, then B\" is also true. This is because the additional condition C does not negate the original implication.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'If the zonk is twiddled and it is blorped, then it will pluzzle' is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
