This means that whenever the condition A (the plim is grobbled) is true, the conclusion B (the whiffle will sploosh) must also be true.\n\nThe proposed inference adds an additional condition, \"and the drazzle is drooped\", to the original statement. This means that the new statement would be in the form \"If A and C, then B\".\n\nIn general, if a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is true, then we can infer that \"If A and C, then B\" is also true. This is because the additional condition C does not affect the logical implication between A and B.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'If the plim is grobbled and the drazzle is drooped, then the whiffle will sploosh' is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
