This statement is in the form \"If A and C, then B\", where A is \"the plink has morphed\", C is \"it was misglommed\", and B is \"it will tizzle\".\n\nTo determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. Specifically, we need to determine if the first statement (\"If the plink has morphed, then it will tizzle\") is logically stronger than the second statement (\"If the plink has morphed and it was misglommed, then it will tizzle\").\n\nIf the first statement is logically stronger, then we can infer the second statement from the first. This is because if the plink tizzles whenever it has morphed, then it will also tizzle whenever it has morphed and was misglommed, since the latter condition is more specific.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the statement \"If the plink has morphed and it was misglommed, then it will tizzle\" from the given statement \"If the plink has morphed, then it will tizzle\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
