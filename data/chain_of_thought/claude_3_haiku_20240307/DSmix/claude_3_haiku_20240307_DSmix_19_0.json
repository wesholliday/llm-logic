The second statement is: \"The smonk might not be plagged.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the smonk is not vreebled, then it must be plagged.\n4. The second statement tells us that the smonk might not be plagged.\n5. Therefore, if the smonk might not be plagged, and it must either be vreebled or plagged, then the smonk must be vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
