The first premise is 'Either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled'. This means that the zinger must be either fraggled or smoogled, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is 'The zinger might not be smoogled'. This means that the zinger is not necessarily smoogled.\n\n3. If the zinger is not smoogled, and it must be either fraggled or smoogled, then the only remaining possibility is that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer 'The zinger is fraggled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
