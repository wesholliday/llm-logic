The first premise is \"Either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked.\" This means that the whiffle must be either shanked or tinked, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is \"The whiffle might not be tinked.\" This means that it is possible that the whiffle is not tinked.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the two possibilities:\n   - If the whiffle is not tinked, then it must be shanked, based on the first premise.\n   - If the whiffle might not be tinked, then it is possible that the whiffle is shanked.\n\n4. Therefore, from the given information, we can infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
