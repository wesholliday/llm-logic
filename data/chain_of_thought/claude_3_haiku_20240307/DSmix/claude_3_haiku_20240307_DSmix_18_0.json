We are also given the statement: \"The shank might not be nugged.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the shank is not plooked, then it must be nugged.\n4. The second statement tells us that the shank might not be nugged.\n5. Therefore, if the shank might not be nugged, and if it is not nugged, then it must be plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
