The first premise is 'Either the wug is flooped or it must be bimmed'. This means that the wug must either be flooped or bimmed, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is 'The wug might not be bimmed'. This means that it is possible that the wug is not bimmed.\n\n3. If the wug is not bimmed, then by the first premise, it must be flooped. This is because the first premise states that the wug must either be flooped or bimmed, and if it is not bimmed, then it must be flooped.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer 'The wug is flooped'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
