We are also given the statement: \"The dreb might not be spened.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the dreb is not vroombed, then it must be spened.\n4. The second statement tells us that the dreb might not be spened.\n5. Therefore, if the dreb might not be spened, and it must either be vroombed or spened, then the dreb must be vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
