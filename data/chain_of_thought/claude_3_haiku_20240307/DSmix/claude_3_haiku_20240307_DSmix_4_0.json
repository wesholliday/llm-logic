This means that the fribble must be either snurgled or crinked, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is \"The fribble might not be crinked\". This means that it's possible that the fribble is not crinked.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the two possibilities:\n   - If the fribble is not crinked, then by the first premise, it must be snurgled.\n   - If the fribble is crinked, then by the first premise, it cannot be snurgled.\n\n4. Since the second premise states that the fribble might not be crinked, the first possibility must be true, and therefore, we can infer that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
