We are also given the statement: \"The smip might not be lupped.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the smip is not shripped, then it must be lupped.\n4. The second statement tells us that the smip might not be lupped.\n5. Therefore, if the smip might not be lupped, and if it's not lupped then it must be shripped, we can infer that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes"
