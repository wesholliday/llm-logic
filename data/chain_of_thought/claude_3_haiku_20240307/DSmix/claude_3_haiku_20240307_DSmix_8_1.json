It presents a mutually exclusive choice between these two possibilities.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second premise, \"The sprocket might not be daggled.\"\nThis premise suggests that the sprocket might not be daggled. In other words, it is possible that the sprocket is not daggled.\n\nStep 3: Combine the two premises:\nBased on the first premise, if the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked. The second premise tells us that the sprocket might not be daggled.
