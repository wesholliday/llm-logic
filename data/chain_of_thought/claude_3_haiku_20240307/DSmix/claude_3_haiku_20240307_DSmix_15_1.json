We have the statement 'Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened'.\n2. We also have the statement 'The dreb might not be spened'.\n3. From the first statement, we can conclude that if the dreb is not vroombed, then it must be spened.\n4. The second statement, 'The dreb might not be spened', implies that the dreb might be spened, or it might not be spened.\n5. If the dreb might not be spened, then it must be vroombed, as per the first statement.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that 'The dreb is vroombed'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
