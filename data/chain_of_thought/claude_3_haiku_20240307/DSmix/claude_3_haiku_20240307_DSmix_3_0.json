We are also given the statement: \"The splat might not be quanked.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed.\n4. The second statement tells us that the splat might not be quanked.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
