The first statement is \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled.\" This means that the sprocket can be in one of two states: either it is cranked or it is daggled.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The sprocket might not be daggled.\" This means that it is possible that the sprocket is not in the daggled state.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the two possible states of the sprocket:\n   - If the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked, based on the first statement.\n   - If the sprocket is daggled, then it cannot be cranked, based on the first statement.\n\n4. Since the second statement tells us that the sprocket might not be daggled, the only possible state for the sprocket is that it is cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
