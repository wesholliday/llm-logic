The first premise is 'Either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated'. This means that the flob must be either skizzled or movated, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is 'The flob might not be movated'. This means that the flob may not be movated.\n\n3. If the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled, based on the first premise. This is because the first premise states that the flob must be either skizzled or movated, and if it is not movated, then it must be skizzled.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that 'The flob is skizzled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
