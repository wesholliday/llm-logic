The first premise is 'Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked'.\n2. The second premise is 'The twonk might not be plinked'.\n3. From the first premise, we know that if the twonk is not plinked, then it must be varnished.\n4. The second premise tells us that the twonk might not be plinked.\n5. Therefore, if the twonk might not be plinked, then it must be varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes"
