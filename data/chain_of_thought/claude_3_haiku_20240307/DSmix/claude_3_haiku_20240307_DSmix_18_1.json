This means that the shank can only be in one of two states: plooked or nugged.\n\nThe second premise is 'The shank might not be nugged'. This means that the shank is not necessarily in the nugged state.\n\nNow, if the shank is not nugged, and it can only be in one of two states (plooked or nugged), then the only remaining possibility is that the shank is plooked.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer 'The shank is plooked'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
