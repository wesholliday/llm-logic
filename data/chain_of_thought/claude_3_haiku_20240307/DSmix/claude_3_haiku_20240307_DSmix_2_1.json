This means that the wug must either be flooped or bimmed, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is \"The wug might not be bimmed\". This means that it is possible that the wug is not bimmed.\n\n3. If the wug might not be bimmed, and it must either be flooped or bimmed, then the only possibility left is that the wug is flooped.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that \"The wug is flooped\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
