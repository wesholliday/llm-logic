We are also given the statement: \"The sneg might not be sproted.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the sneg is not crampled, then it must be sproted.\n4. The second statement tells us that the sneg might not be sproted.\n5. Therefore, if the sneg might not be sproted, and if it's not sproted, then it must be crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
