This means that the grommet is either sploffed or plopped, but not both.\n\n2. The second premise is \"The grommet might not be plopped\". This means that it is possible that the grommet is not plopped.\n\n3. From the first premise, we know that if the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed.\n\n4. Since the second premise tells us that the grommet might not be plopped, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
