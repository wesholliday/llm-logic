We are also given the statement: \"The wug might not be garpled.\"\n3. From the first statement, we can infer that if the wug is not sproinged, then it must be garpled.\n4. The second statement tells us that the wug might not be garpled.\n5. If the wug might not be garpled, and the only other possibility is that it is sproinged, then we can infer that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
