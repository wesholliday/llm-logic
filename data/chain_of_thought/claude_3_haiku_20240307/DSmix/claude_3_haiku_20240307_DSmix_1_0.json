The second premise is \"The flugel might not be zargled.\"\n3. From the first premise, we can infer that if the flugel is not blimmed, then it must be zargled.\n4. The second premise tells us that the flugel might not be zargled.\n5. Therefore, if the flugel might not be zargled, and it must either be blimmed or zargled, then the flugel must be blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
