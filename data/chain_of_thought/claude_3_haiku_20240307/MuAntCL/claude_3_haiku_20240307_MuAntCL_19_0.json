The statement only specifies that the application was completed online, but it does not provide any information about whether the application included references or not.\n\nThe original statement is a specific claim about the application being completed online, but it does not make any additional claims about the inclusion of references. To infer that the application \"must have been completed online and included references\", we would need additional information or a stronger statement that explicitly mentions both the online completion and the inclusion of references.\n\nAnswer: no"
