            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The concert must have been sold out\" does not provide any information about the start time of the concert. The fact that the concert was sold out only indicates that it was popular and all the tickets were purchased, but it does not necessarily imply anything about the start time of the concert. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
