The statement only indicates that the package was delivered, but it does not provide any information about whether it was signed for or not.\n\nThe fact that a package was delivered does not automatically mean that it was signed for. There are various delivery methods, such as leaving the package at the door or in a secure location, where the recipient may not have to sign for it.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from the given statement that the package must have been delivered yesterday and signed for. The information provided is not sufficient to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
