The statement only provides information about the flight being delayed, but does not mention anything about the flight being rerouted.\n\nTo infer that the flight was both delayed and rerouted, we would need additional information or context that specifically indicates the flight was rerouted. The original statement does not provide enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
