The original statement only indicates that the movie was in the English language, but it does not provide any information about whether the movie had subtitles or not.\n\nTo infer that the movie was in English and had subtitles, we would need additional information or a stronger premise that explicitly states the presence of subtitles. The given statement alone does not provide enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
