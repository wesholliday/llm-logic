            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been signed\" does not necessarily imply that the document was also notarized. Signing a document and having it notarized are two separate and distinct actions.\n\nSigning a document simply means that the person whose name appears on the document has affixed their signature to it, indicating their agreement or acknowledgment of the contents. Notarization, on the other hand, involves a notary public witnessing the signing of the document and verifying the identity of the signer. Notarization provides an additional layer of authentication and legal validity to the document.\n\nTherefore, the fact that a document must have been signed does not automatically mean that it was also notarized. The statement \"The document must have been signed\" does not provide enough information to infer that the document was also notarized.\n\nAnswer: no"
