The difficulty of an exam can be influenced by various factors, such as the complexity of the questions, the time constraints, or the level of understanding required, without necessarily being related to the breadth of the material covered.\n\nTo infer that the exam \"must have been difficult and covered all chapters\" would require additional information or context that is not provided in the given statement. The original statement only suggests that the exam was difficult, but does not provide any information about the scope or coverage of the exam.\n\nAnswer: no"
