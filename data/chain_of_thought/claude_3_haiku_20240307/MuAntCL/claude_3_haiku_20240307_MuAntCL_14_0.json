The statement only specifies the duration of the contract, which was one year. It does not provide any information about whether the contract was renewable or not.\n\nTo infer that the contract was valid for a year and renewable, we would need additional information or context that explicitly states or suggests the contract was renewable. The given statement alone does not provide enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
