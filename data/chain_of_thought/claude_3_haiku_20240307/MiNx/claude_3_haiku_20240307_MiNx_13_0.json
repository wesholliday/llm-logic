This means that the glip being slogged is not a necessary or certain outcome.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement 'It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged' means that it is not true that the glip was necessarily or certainly slogged.\n\nSince the first statement, 'The glip might not have been slogged', allows for the possibility that the glip was not slogged, it is logically consistent with the second statement, 'It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged' from the statement 'The glip might not have been slogged'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
