This does not necessarily mean that the wug was not sproinged, but rather that it is not certain that the wug was sproinged.\n\nThe statement 'It's not the case that the wug must have been sproinged' is a negation of the necessity statement 'The wug must have been sproinged'. This means that it is not the case that the wug was necessarily sproinged.\n\nSince the possibility statement 'The wug might not have been sproinged' does not imply the necessity statement 'The wug must have been sproinged', we can infer that 'It's not the case that the wug must have been sproinged' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
