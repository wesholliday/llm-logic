This means that the shank was not necessarily plooked.\n\nThe statement 'It's not the case that the shank must have been plooked' is the negation of the statement 'The shank must have been plooked'. This means that it is not the case that the shank was necessarily plooked.\n\nSince the first statement, 'The shank might not have been plooked', suggests that the shank was not necessarily plooked, we can infer that the second statement, 'It's not the case that the shank must have been plooked', is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
