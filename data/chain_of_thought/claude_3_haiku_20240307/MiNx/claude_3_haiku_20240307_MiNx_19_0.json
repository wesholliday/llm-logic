This means that there is a possibility that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nNow, the statement 'It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled' is the negation of the statement 'The smonk must have been vreebled'. This means that the smonk was not necessarily vreebled, and there is a possibility that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nSince the given statement 'The smonk might not have been vreebled' already suggests the possibility that the smonk was not vreebled, we can infer that 'It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled' is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
