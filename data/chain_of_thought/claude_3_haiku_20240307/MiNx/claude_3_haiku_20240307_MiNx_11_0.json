This statement does not imply that the flug must have been blummed, but rather that it is possible that the flug was not blummed.\n\nThe statement 'It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed' is the negation of the statement 'The flug must have been blummed'. This means that the statement 'It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed' is true if and only if the statement 'The flug must have been blummed' is false.\n\nSince the original statement 'The flug might not have been blummed' does not imply that the flug must have been blummed, we can infer that 'It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
