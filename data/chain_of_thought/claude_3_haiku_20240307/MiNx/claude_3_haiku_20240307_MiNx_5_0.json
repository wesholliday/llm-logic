This means that there is at least one scenario where the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nThe statement 'It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled' is the negation of the statement 'The zinger must have been fraggled'. This means that it is not necessary or required for the zinger to have been fraggled.\n\nSince the first statement, 'The zinger might not have been fraggled', allows for the possibility that the zinger was not fraggled, it is logically consistent with the second statement, 'It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled' from 'The zinger might not have been fraggled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
