This means that there is at least one scenario where the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nNow, the statement 'It's not the case that the grommet must have been sploffed' is the negation of 'The grommet must have been sploffed'. This means that it is not necessary or required for the grommet to have been sploffed.\n\nSince 'The grommet might not have been sploffed' allows for the possibility that the grommet was not sploffed, it logically follows that 'It's not the case that the grommet must have been sploffed' is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
