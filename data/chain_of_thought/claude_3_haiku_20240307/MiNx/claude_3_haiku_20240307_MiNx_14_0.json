This is a weaker statement than 'The clug must have been fleeked', which would be a necessity statement.\n\nThe negation of the necessity statement 'The clug must have been fleeked' is 'It's not the case that the clug must have been fleeked'. This is a logically equivalent statement to 'The clug might not have been fleeked'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that the clug must have been fleeked' from the statement 'The clug might not have been fleeked'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
