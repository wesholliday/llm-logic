This statement does not imply that the flugel must have been blimmed.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement 'It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed' is a negation of a necessity statement. This means that it is not the case that the flugel was necessarily blimmed.\n\nSince the first statement, 'The flugel might not have been blimmed', is a possibility statement and does not imply necessity, we can infer the second statement, 'It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
