This statement does not imply that the smip must have been shripped.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement 'It's not the case that the smip must have been shripped' is a negation of the necessity statement 'The smip must have been shripped'. This means that it is not necessary for the smip to have been shripped.\n\nSince the possibility statement 'The smip might not have been shripped' does not imply the necessity statement 'The smip must have been shripped', we can infer that the negation of the necessity statement, 'It's not the case that the smip must have been shripped', is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
