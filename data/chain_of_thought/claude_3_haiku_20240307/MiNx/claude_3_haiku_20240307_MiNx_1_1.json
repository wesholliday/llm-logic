The given statement, \"The flugel might not have been blimmed,\" suggests that it is possible that the flugel was not blimmed. This statement does not make any definitive claim about whether the flugel was or was not blimmed.\n\n2. The proposed inference, \"It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed,\" means that it is not necessary or required that the flugel was blimmed.\n\n3. The given statement and the proposed inference are logically consistent. If the flugel might not have been blimmed, then it follows that it is not necessary or required that the flugel must have been blimmed.\n\nTherefore, from the given statement, we can infer that the proposed statement is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"

It does not imply a necessity or requirement.\n\nThe statement 'It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed' is a negation of the necessity of the flugel being blimmed. This is a stronger statement than the original possibility statement, as it denies the necessity rather than just allowing for the possibility of the flugel not being blimmed.\n\nSince the original statement only expresses a possibility and does not imply necessity, we can infer the stronger statement 'It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
