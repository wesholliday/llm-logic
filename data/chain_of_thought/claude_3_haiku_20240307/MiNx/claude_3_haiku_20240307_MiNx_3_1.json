It means that it is possible that the splat was not morphed.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed\" is a negation of a necessity statement. It means that it is not necessary that the splat was morphed.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationship between these two statements:\n\nIf the splat might not have been morphed, then it is not necessarily the case that the splat must have been morphed. This is because if there is a possibility that the splat was not morphed, then it cannot be the case that the splat must have been morphed.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"The splat might not have been morphed\", we can infer \"It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
