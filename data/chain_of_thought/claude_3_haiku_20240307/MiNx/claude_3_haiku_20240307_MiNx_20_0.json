This means that the fleeg being bluttered is not a necessary or certain outcome.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement 'It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered' means that the fleeg being bluttered is not a required or inevitable outcome.\n\nSince the first statement allows for the possibility that the fleeg was not bluttered, it logically follows that the second statement is also true. If the fleeg might not have been bluttered, then it is not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered' from the statement 'The fleeg might not have been bluttered'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
