This statement does not make a definitive claim about whether the splat was or was not morphed.\n\nThe second statement, \"It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed,\" is the negation of the statement \"The splat must have been morphed.\" This means that it is not necessary or required for the splat to have been morphed.\n\nNow, let's consider the relationship between these two statements:\n\nIf the splat might not have been morphed, then it is not the case that the splat must have been morphed. In other words, the first statement implies the second statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed\" from the statement \"The splat might not have been morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
