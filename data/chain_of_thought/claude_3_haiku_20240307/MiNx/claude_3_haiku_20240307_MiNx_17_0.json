This means that there is a possibility that the flob was not skizzled.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement 'It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled' means that it is not necessary or required for the flob to have been skizzled.\n\nSince the first statement, 'The flob might not have been skizzled', allows for the possibility that the flob was not skizzled, it logically follows that the second statement, 'It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled', is also true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled' from the statement 'The flob might not have been skizzled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
