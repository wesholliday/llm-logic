This means that the fribble's being snurgled is not a necessary or certain outcome.\n\nNow, the statement 'It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled' is the negation of the statement 'The fribble must have been snurgled'. This means that the fribble's being snurgled is not a necessary or certain outcome.\n\nSince the given statement 'The fribble might not have been snurgled' already implies that the fribble's being snurgled is not a necessary or certain outcome, we can infer that 'It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
