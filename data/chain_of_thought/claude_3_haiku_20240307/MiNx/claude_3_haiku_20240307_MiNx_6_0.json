This statement does not imply that the grommet must not have been sploffed, but rather that it is a possibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement 'It's not the case that the grommet must have been sploffed' is a negation of the necessity statement 'The grommet must have been sploffed'. This means that it is not the case that the grommet was necessarily sploffed.\n\nSince the possibility statement 'The grommet might not have been sploffed' does not imply the necessity statement 'The grommet must have been sploffed', we can infer that 'It's not the case that the grommet must have been sploffed' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
