This means that there is a possibility that the wug was not flooped.\n\nThe statement 'It's not the case that the wug must have been flooped' means that it is not necessary or required that the wug was flooped. In other words, it is not the case that the wug was definitely flooped.\n\nSince the first statement, 'The wug might not have been flooped', allows for the possibility that the wug was not flooped, it is logically consistent with the second statement, 'It's not the case that the wug must have been flooped'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that the wug must have been flooped' from the statement 'The wug might not have been flooped'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
