This statement does not imply that the twonk must have been plinked.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement 'It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked' is a negation of the necessity statement, which means that it is not the case that the twonk was necessarily plinked.\n\nSince the first statement, 'The twonk might not have been plinked', does not imply the necessity of the twonk being plinked, we can infer that the second statement, 'It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked', is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
