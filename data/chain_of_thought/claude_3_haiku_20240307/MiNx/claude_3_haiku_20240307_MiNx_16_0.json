This means that the sneg being crampled is not a necessary or certain outcome.\n\nThe statement 'It's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled' is the negation of the statement 'The sneg must have been crampled'. This means that it is not the case that the sneg being crampled is a necessary or certain outcome.\n\nSince the first statement, 'The sneg might not have been crampled', implies that the sneg being crampled is not a necessary or certain outcome, we can infer that the second statement, 'It's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled', is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
