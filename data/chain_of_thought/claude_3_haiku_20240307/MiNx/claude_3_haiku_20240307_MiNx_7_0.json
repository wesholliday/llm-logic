This means that there is a possibility that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nNow, the statement 'It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked' is the negation of the statement 'The whiffle must have been shanked'. This means that it is not necessary or required that the whiffle was shanked.\n\nSince the first statement, 'The whiffle might not have been shanked', allows for the possibility that the whiffle was not shanked, it logically follows that the second statement, 'It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked', is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
