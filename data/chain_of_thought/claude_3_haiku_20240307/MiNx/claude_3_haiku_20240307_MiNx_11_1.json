The given statement, \"The flug might not have been blummed,\" suggests that it is possible that the flug was not blummed.\n\n2. The inference, \"It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed,\" means that it is not necessary or required that the flug was blummed.\n\n3. If it is possible that the flug was not blummed (as stated in the given statement), then it necessarily follows that it is not the case that the flug must have been blummed (the inference).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we can infer that the statement \"It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
