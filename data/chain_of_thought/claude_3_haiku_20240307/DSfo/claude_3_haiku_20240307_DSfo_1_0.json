We are also given the premise \"Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside\".\n3. The second premise is a disjunction, which means that one of the two statements must be true: either Fido is in the garden, or Fido is inside.\n4. However, the first premise tells us that Fido is not in the garden.\n5. Therefore, the only remaining possibility from the disjunction is that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
