'The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor'\n2. 'Either the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor or it is in the box'\n\nThe second premise is a disjunction, which means that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n\nSince the first premise states that 'The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor', this means that the first part of the disjunction ('The missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor') must be false.\n\nIf the first part of the disjunction is false, then the second part ('The missing puzzle piece is in the box') must be true, according to the rules of disjunction.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The missing puzzle piece is in the box'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
