We are given the following two statements:\n   - \"The cat isn't playing in the bedroom\"\n   - \"Either the cat is playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch\"\n\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that the cat is not playing in the bedroom.\n\n3. The second statement is a disjunction, which means that either the cat is playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch, but not both.\n\n4. Since we know from the first statement that the cat is not playing in the bedroom, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes"
