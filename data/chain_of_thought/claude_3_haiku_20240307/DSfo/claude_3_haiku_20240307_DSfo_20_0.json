The second statement gives us two possibilities: either the sunglasses are perched on her head or they are in her bag.\n\nSince the first statement tells us that the sunglasses are not perched on her head, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
