We are given the premises:\n   - \"The milk isn't chilling in the fridge\"\n   - \"Either the milk is chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter\"\n\n2. The first premise tells us that the milk is not chilling in the fridge.\n\n3. The second premise gives us two possibilities: either the milk is chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter.\n\n4. Since the first premise tells us that the milk is not chilling in the fridge, the only remaining possibility from the second premise is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes"
