We are also given the statement \"Either the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf\".\n3. The first statement tells us that the book is not on the table.\n4. The second statement tells us that the book must be either on the table or on the shelf.\n5. Since the book is not on the table (from the first statement), the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The book is on the shelf\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
