We are given the statement 'The newspaper isn't sitting on the porch'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'Either the newspaper is sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway'.\n3. The second statement is a disjunction, which means that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n4. Since the first statement tells us that the newspaper is not sitting on the porch, the only remaining possibility from the disjunction is that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n5. Therefore, we can infer that 'The newspaper is in the driveway'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
