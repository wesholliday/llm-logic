We are given the following two premises:\n   - \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet\"\n   - \"Either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer\"\n\n2. From the first premise, we can infer that the keys are not in the cabinet.\n\n3. The second premise states that the keys are either dangling in the cabinet or in the drawer.\n\n4. Since the keys are not in the cabinet (from the first premise), the only remaining possibility is that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The keys are in the drawer\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
