We are given the following two premises:\n   - \"The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen\"\n   - \"Either the phone is ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room\"\n\n2. From the first premise, we can infer that the phone is not in the kitchen.\n\n3. The second premise states that either the phone is ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room. Since we know from the first premise that the phone is not in the kitchen, the only remaining possibility is that the phone is in the living room.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The phone is in the living room.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
