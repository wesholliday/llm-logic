We are also given the statement: \"Either the umbrella is tucked away in the closet or it is in the car.\"\n3. The second statement is a disjunction, which means that one of the two possibilities must be true.\n4. Since the first statement tells us that the umbrella is not in the closet, the only remaining possibility from the disjunction is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes"
