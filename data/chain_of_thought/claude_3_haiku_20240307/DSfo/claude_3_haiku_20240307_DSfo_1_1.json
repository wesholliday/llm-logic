'Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside'\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first premise, 'Fido is not in the garden'. This tells us that Fido is not located in the garden.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second premise, 'Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside'. This is a disjunction, which means that one or the other, or both, must be true.\n\nStep 3: Since the first premise tells us that Fido is not in the garden, the only remaining possibility from the disjunction in the second premise is that Fido is inside.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'Fido is inside'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
