We are also given the statement \"Either the missing sock is under the bed or it's in the laundry basket\".\n3. From the first statement, we know that the missing sock is not under the bed.\n4. From the second statement, we know that the missing sock must be either under the bed or in the laundry basket.\n5. Since the first statement tells us that the missing sock is not under the bed, the only remaining possibility is that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes"
