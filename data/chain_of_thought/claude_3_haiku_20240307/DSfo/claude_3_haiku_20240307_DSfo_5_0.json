The second statement then tells us that the cookies must be either in the pantry or in the jar.\n\nSince we know the cookies are not in the pantry (from the first statement), the only remaining possibility is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
