We are given the following two statements:\n   - \"The shoes aren't lined up by the door\"\n   - \"Either the shoes are lined up by the door or they are in the closet\"\n\n2. From the second statement, we can see that there are two possibilities for the location of the shoes:\n   - The shoes are lined up by the door\n   - The shoes are in the closet\n\n3. The first statement tells us that the shoes are not lined up by the door.\n\n4. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes"

'Either the shoes are lined up by the door or they are in the closet'\n\nWe can represent these statements using logical symbols:\n1. ~(Shoes are lined up by the door)\n2. (Shoes are lined up by the door) \u2228 (Shoes are in the closet)\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of logic to determine if we can infer 'The shoes are in the closet'.\n\nFrom the given information, we can see that the shoes are not lined up by the door (statement 1). This means that the first part of the second statement, 'the shoes are lined up by the door', is false.\n\nSince the first part of the second statement is false, the second part of the statement, 'the shoes are in the closet', must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The shoes are in the closet'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
