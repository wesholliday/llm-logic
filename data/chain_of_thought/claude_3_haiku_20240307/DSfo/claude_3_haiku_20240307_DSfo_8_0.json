We are given the following two statements:\n   - \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch\"\n   - \"Either the remote control is hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table\"\n\n2. The first statement tells us that the remote control is not under the couch.\n\n3. The second statement gives us two possibilities: either the remote control is under the couch or it is on the coffee table.\n\n4. Since the first statement tells us that the remote control is not under the couch, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
