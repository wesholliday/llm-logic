We are given the following two premises:\n   - \"The shoes aren't lined up by the door\"\n   - \"Either the shoes are lined up by the door or they are in the closet\"\n\n2. From the first premise, we know that the shoes are not lined up by the door.\n\n3. The second premise tells us that there are two possible locations for the shoes: either they are lined up by the door, or they are in the closet.\n\n4. Since the first premise tells us that the shoes are not lined up by the door, the only remaining possibility from the second premise is that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes"
