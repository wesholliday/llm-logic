We are given the following premises:\n   - \"The watch isn't on his wrist\"\n   - \"Either the watch is on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser\"\n\n2. From the second premise, we can infer that the watch must be either on his wrist or charging on the dresser. This is because the premise states that these are the only two possible locations for the watch.\n\n3. The first premise tells us that the watch is not on his wrist. This means that the watch must be charging on the dresser, as this is the only other possible location according to the second premise.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The watch is charging on the dresser\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
