We are given the following two statements:\n   a) \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch\"\n   b) \"Either the remote control is hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table\"\n\n2. From statement (b), we can conclude that the remote control must be either under the couch or on the coffee table. This is because the statement says it is \"either\" one or the other.\n\n3. Now, statement (a) tells us that the remote control is not hiding under the couch. \n\n4. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the remote control must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
