The first premise is a disjunction, which states that either one of the two possibilities is true: the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\n\n2. The second premise negates the second part of the disjunction, stating that it is not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\n\n3.
