            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following structure:\nPremise 1: Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\nPremise 2: It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\nConclusion: The book is on the shelf.\n\nLet's consider the logical validity of this argument:\n\nThe first premise presents two possibilities: either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table. This is a disjunction, where one of the two options must be true.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table. This means that the second option in the first premise is false, leaving the first option as the only remaining possibility.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that the book is on the shelf follows logically from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
