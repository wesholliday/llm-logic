This means that one of two possibilities is true: either Fido is inside, or Fido must be in the garden.\n2) The second premise is \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\". This means that the second part of the disjunction in the first premise is false - Fido does not have to be in the garden.\n3) The conclusion is \"Fido is inside\". This follows logically from the first premise and the second premise, because if either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden, and Fido does not have to be in the garden, then the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
