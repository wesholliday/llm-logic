            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays\" implies that the restaurant was not open on Mondays. This could mean that the restaurant was either closed for the entire day on Mondays or had limited hours of operation on Mondays. The statement does not provide any information about the restaurant's hours of operation on other days of the week.\n\nTherefore, the inference \"The restaurant must have been open for limited hours or closed on Mondays\" is valid, as it is consistent with the information given in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
