The statement only indicates that the event was formal, but it does not provide any information about whether the event could have been semi-formal as well.\n\nThe term \"formal\" refers to a specific level of dress code and event style, which is typically more structured and requires more formal attire than a semi-formal event. However, the statement does not rule out the possibility that the event could have been semi-formal, as semi-formal events can also be considered formal to some degree.\n\nAnswer: no"
