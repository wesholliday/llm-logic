It does not necessarily mean that the room was cleaned upon request. The statement only specifies that the cleaning occurred daily, without providing any information about whether it was done upon request or not.\n\nTo infer that the room was cleaned \"upon request or daily,\" we would need additional information that suggests the room could have been cleaned either upon request or on a daily basis. The given statement does not provide that level of detail.\n\nAnswer: no"
