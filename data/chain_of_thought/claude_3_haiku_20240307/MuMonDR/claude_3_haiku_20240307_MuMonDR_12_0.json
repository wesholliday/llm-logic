The statement only indicates that the project must have been completed by Friday, but it does not provide any information about whether the project was extended or not.\n\nThe statement \"The project must have been extended or completed by Friday\" is a stronger statement that includes the possibility of the project being extended. The original statement does not explicitly mention the possibility of an extension, so we cannot infer that the project must have been extended or completed by Friday.\n\nAnswer: no"
