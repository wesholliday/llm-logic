The statement only specifies that the envelope must be under a bed, but it does not provide any information about the location of the bed or whether the envelope could be in other locations.\n\nTo infer that the envelope must be upstairs or under a bed, we would need additional information that the bed is located upstairs or that the only possible locations for the envelope are upstairs or under a bed. The given statement alone does not provide this additional information.\n\nAnswer: no"
