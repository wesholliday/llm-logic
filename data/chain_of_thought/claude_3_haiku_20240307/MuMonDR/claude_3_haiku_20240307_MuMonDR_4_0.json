The statement only indicates that the meeting was scheduled for 2 PM, but it does not mention anything about the meeting being cancelled.\n\nTo infer that the meeting \"must have been cancelled or scheduled for 2 PM,\" we would need additional information or context that suggests the meeting could have been cancelled. The given statement alone does not provide that information.\n\nAnswer: no"
