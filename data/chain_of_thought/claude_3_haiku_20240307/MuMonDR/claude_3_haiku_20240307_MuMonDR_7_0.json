The original statement only suggests that the exam was difficult, without providing any information about the possibility of it being easy.\n\nTo infer that the exam could have been either easy or difficult, we would need additional information or context that suggests the exam could have had a range of difficulty levels. The original statement alone does not provide enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
