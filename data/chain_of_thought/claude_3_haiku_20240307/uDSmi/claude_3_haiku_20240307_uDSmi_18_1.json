The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first statement.\nThe first statement presents two possibilities for the location of the notebook:\n- The notebook is in the drawer.\n- The notebook is sitting on the nightstand.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the second statement.\nThe second statement indicates that the notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand. This means that the notebook is not necessarily on the nightstand.\n\nStep 3: Combine the information.\nGiven that the notebook is either in the drawer or on the nightstand, and that it might not be on the nightstand, the only remaining possibility is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"

We are given two statements:\n   a) The notebook is either in the drawer or on the nightstand.\n   b) The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\n\n2. From statement (a), we know that the notebook is in one of two places: the drawer or the nightstand.\n\n3. Statement (b) tells us that the notebook might not be on the nightstand. This means that it is possible that the notebook is not on the nightstand.\n\n4. If the notebook is not on the nightstand, and it must be either in the drawer or on the nightstand (from statement (a)), then the only possible location for the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
