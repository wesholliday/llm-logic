If the remote control is not under the couch, then the only remaining option is that it is on the coffee table.\n2. If the remote control is under the couch, then the statement \"the remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" would not be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
