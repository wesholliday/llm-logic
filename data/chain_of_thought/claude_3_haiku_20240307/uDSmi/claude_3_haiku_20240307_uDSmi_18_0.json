The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nNow, let's think through the reasoning:\n* If the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand, then it must be in the drawer, based on the first statement.\n* However, the second statement says that the notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand, which means it's possible that the notebook is not in the drawer either.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: no"
