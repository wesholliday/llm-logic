Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or under the bed.\n2. The missing sock might not be under the bed.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if the missing sock is not under the bed, then it must be in the laundry basket. This is because the two options given are \"either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed.\"\n\nThe second statement, \"the missing sock might not be under the bed,\" further supports the conclusion that the missing sock is in the laundry basket. If the missing sock might not be under the bed, then the only other option is that it is in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes"
