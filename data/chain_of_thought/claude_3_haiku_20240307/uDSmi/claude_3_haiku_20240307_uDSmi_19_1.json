The first sentence states that either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\n2. The second sentence states that the watch might not be on his wrist.\n\nBased on this information, we have two possible scenarios:\n- The watch is charging on the dresser.\n- The watch is not on his wrist, but we don't know where it is.\n\nSince the second sentence says the watch might not be on his wrist, we cannot conclude that the watch is definitely charging on the dresser. There is still another possibility that the watch is somewhere else, not on his wrist or on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: no"
