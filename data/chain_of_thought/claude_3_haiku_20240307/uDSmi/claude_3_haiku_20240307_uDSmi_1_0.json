Fido might not be in the garden.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if Fido is not inside, then he must be in the garden. However, the second statement tells us that Fido might not be in the garden.\n\nIf Fido might not be in the garden, and he must either be inside or in the garden, then the only possible location for Fido is inside.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
