However, this does not necessarily mean that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was also awake.\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement: \"The mummy was awake.\" This means that the mummy was indeed awake.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"From 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' together with 'The mummy was awake', can we conclude 'The vampire was awake'?\"\n\nTo answer this, we need to think about the logical implications. The first statement tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. The second statement tells us that the mummy was awake. However, this does not necessarily mean that the vampire was also awake.\n\nThe reason is that the first statement is a conditional statement, and it only tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. It does not tell us anything about the converse, which would be \"if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: no"
