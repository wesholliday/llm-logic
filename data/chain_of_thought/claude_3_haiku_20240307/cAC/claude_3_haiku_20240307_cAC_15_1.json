The first premise is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Sam took a plane) is true, then the second part (Erin took a train) must also be true.\n\n2. The second premise is \"Erin took a train.\" This is a simple statement that affirms the consequent of the conditional statement in the first premise.\n\n3. The question is asking whether we can conclude that \"Sam took a plane\" from these two premises.\n\nConsidering the logic:\n- If the first premise is true (i.e., if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train), and the second premise is true (i.e., Erin took a train), then we can infer that the first part of the conditional statement is also true, which means that Sam took a plane.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes"
