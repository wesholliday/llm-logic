The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This means that if the condition \"Sam took a plane\" is true, then the conclusion \"Erin took a train\" is also true.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Erin took a train.\" This means that the conclusion \"Erin took a train\" is true.\n\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can conclude that \"Sam took a plane\" from the given information.\n\nThe first statement tells us that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. The second statement tells us that Erin did take a train. However, this does not necessarily mean that Sam took a plane. The first statement does not tell us that if Erin took a train, then Sam must have taken a plane.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that \"Sam took a plane\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
