However, this does not necessarily mean that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement: \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that Sue was present at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"From 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' together with 'Sue was at the wedding', can we conclude 'Mary was at the wedding'?\"\n\nTo answer this, we need to think about the logical implications of the given statements.\n\nThe first statement tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. The second statement tells us that Sue was at the wedding. However, this does not necessarily mean that Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nThe reason is that the first statement is a conditional statement, and it only tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. It does not tell us anything about the converse, which would be \"if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot conclude that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no"
