The question is asking whether we can conclude that \"Sue chose pizza\" from the given information.\n\nLet's analyze this using the rules of logic:\n- The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the consequent (Bob chose pasta) must be true.\n- The second statement tells us that the consequent (Bob chose pasta) is true.\n- However, from the information given, we cannot conclude that the antecedent (Sue chose pizza) is true. This is because the conditional statement does not guarantee that the antecedent is true just because the consequent is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \"Sue chose pizza.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
