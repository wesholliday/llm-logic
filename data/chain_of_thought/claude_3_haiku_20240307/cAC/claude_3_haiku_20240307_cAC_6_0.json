The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This means that if Sue chose pizza, then it necessarily follows that Bob chose pasta.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Bob chose pasta.\" This means that Bob did, in fact, choose pasta.\n\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can conclude that \"Sue chose pizza\" based on the given information.\n\nSince the first statement tells us that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta, and the second statement tells us that Bob did choose pasta, we can infer that the antecedent of the conditional statement (Sue chose pizza) must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Sue chose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes"
