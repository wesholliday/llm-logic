            "content": "To answer this question, let's think through the logic step-by-step:\n\n1. The given statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n2. This statement is a conditional statement, which means that it has the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is the condition (the apple was red) and Q is the consequence (the banana was yellow).\n3. The second statement is \"The banana was yellow.\"\n4. From the conditional statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and the statement \"The banana was yellow,\" we can conclude that the condition \"the apple was red\" must be true.\n5. This is because the conditional statement tells us that if the condition (the apple was red) is true, then the consequence (the banana was yellow) must also be true. And since we know the consequence is true (the banana was yellow), we can infer that the condition (the apple was red) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
