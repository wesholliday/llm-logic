The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This statement can be expressed in the form of a logical implication: \"If P, then Q,\" where P represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This statement tells us that Q is true.\n\n3. The question is asking whether we can conclude that P (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, given the two statements.\n\nIn logical reasoning, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is true, we can use the rule of modus ponens to conclude that P is also true.\n\nThe rule of modus ponens can be stated as follows: \"If P, then Q, and Q is true, then P is also true.\"\n\nApplying this rule to the given statements, we can conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes"
