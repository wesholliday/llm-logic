The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement. It means that if the apple was red, then it necessarily follows that the banana was yellow.\n\n2. The statement \"The banana was yellow\" is the second part of the conditional statement, which is known to be true.\n\n3. To determine if we can conclude 'The apple was red', we need to consider the logical inference known as modus ponens. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is true, then we can conclude that A is also true.\n\n4. In this case, the conditional statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\", and we know that the banana was yellow. Therefore, following the modus ponens rule, we can conclude that the apple was red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
