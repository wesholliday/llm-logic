The second statement is \"Chris finished the race.\" This is a factual statement, indicating that Chris did indeed finish the race.\n\n3. The question is asking whether we can conclude that \"Alex finished the race\" from the given information.\n\nTo answer this, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements:\n\n- The first statement tells us that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n- The second statement tells us that Chris did finish the race.\n\nBased on this, we can infer that since Chris finished the race, and the first statement tells us that if Alex finished the race, then Chris would have finished the race, it logically follows that Alex must have also finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes"
