However, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. Just because the muffins were blueberry, it does not necessarily mean that the cake was chocolate.\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement: \"The muffins were blueberry.\" This statement is consistent with the first statement, but it does not provide enough information to conclude that \"The cake was chocolate.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \"The cake was chocolate.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
