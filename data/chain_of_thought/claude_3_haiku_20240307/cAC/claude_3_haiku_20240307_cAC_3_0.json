The converse of a conditional statement is the statement formed by swapping the hypothesis and the conclusion. In this case, the converse of the first statement would be: \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James.\"\n\nHowever, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true, even if the original conditional statement is true. In other words, just because the book is a mystery novel, it does not necessarily mean that the book was written by James.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \"The book was written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
