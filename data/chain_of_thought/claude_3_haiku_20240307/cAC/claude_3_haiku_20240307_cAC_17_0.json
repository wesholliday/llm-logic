The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This means that if Ben ate pasta, then it must be true that Kate ate salad.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Kate ate salad.\" This means that Kate did, in fact, eat salad.\n\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can conclude that \"Ben ate pasta\" from the given information.\n\nThe first statement tells us that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. The second statement tells us that Kate did eat salad. However, this does not necessarily mean that Ben ate pasta. The first statement does not tell us that if Kate ate salad, then Ben must have eaten pasta.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that \"Ben ate pasta\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
