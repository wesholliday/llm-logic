We are given the following two statements:\n   - \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\"\n   - \"The book is a mystery novel\"\n\n2. From the first statement, we can infer that if the book is a mystery novel, then it was written by James. In other words, the statement is logically equivalent to \"The book is a mystery novel if and only if it was written by James.\"\n\n3. The second statement tells us that the book is a mystery novel.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the first statement, we can conclude that the book was written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes"
