The second premise is \"The fleeg surned.\"\n3. The question asks whether we can infer \"The fleeg was bluttered\" from these two premises.\n\nTo answer this, we need to consider the logical structure of the first premise. It is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the \"if\" part, \"the fleeg was bluttered\") is true, then the consequent (the \"then\" part, \"it surned\") is also true.\n\nThe second premise tells us that \"The fleeg surned,\" which means that the consequent of the first premise is true. However, this does not automatically mean that the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is also true. The conditional statement does not work in reverse.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot infer that \"The fleeg was bluttered.\" The information provided is not sufficient to draw that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
