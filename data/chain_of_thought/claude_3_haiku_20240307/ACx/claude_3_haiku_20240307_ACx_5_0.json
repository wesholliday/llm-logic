We are given the statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\"\n2. We are also given the statement \"The zinger was smoogled.\"\n3. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was also smoogled.\n4. Since we know that the zinger was smoogled, we can use the first statement to infer that the zinger was fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
