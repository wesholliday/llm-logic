We are given the statement \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\".\n2. We are also given the statement \"The whiffle tinked\".\n3. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the whiffle was shanked) is true, then the consequent (the whiffle tinked) is also true.\n4. Since we are given that the consequent (the whiffle tinked) is true, we can use the rule of modus ponens to infer that the antecedent (the whiffle was shanked) is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The whiffle was shanked'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
