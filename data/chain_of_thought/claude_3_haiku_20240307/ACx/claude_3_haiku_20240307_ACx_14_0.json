We are given the statement \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\".\n2. We are also given the statement \"The clug snugged\".\n3. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition \"the clug was fleeked\" is true, then the consequence \"the clug snugged\" is also true.\n4. Since we are given that \"The clug snugged\" is true, we can infer that the condition \"the clug was fleeked\" must also be true, based on the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
