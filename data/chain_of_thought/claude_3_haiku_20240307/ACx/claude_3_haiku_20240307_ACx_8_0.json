The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\"\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"The sprocket was daggled.\"\n3. To infer 'The sprocket was cranked' from these two statements, we need to use the rule of modus ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (if P, then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then we can conclude that the consequent (Q) is also true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" The second statement, \"The sprocket was daggled,\" confirms the consequent (Q) of the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the antecedent (P) is also true, which means 'The sprocket was cranked.'\n\nAnswer: yes"
