The contrapositive of the conditional statement \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" is \"If the sneg did not sprot the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nIn this case, we have the statement \"The sneg sproted the frink,\" which is the opposite of the consequent in the contrapositive.
