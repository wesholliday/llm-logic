The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\" This means that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n2. The second statement tells us that \"The fleeg surned.\" This means that the fleeg did, in fact, surn.\n3. From the first statement, we know that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned. And the second statement tells us that the fleeg did surn.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the fleeg was bluttered, since the condition for the fleeg to surn (being bluttered) has been met.\n\nAnswer: yes"
