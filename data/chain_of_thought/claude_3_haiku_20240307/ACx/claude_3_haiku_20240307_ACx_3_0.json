The first premise is 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked'.\n2. The second premise is 'The splat quanked'.\n3. The question is asking whether we can infer 'The splat was morphed' from these two premises.\n4. The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the splat was morphed) is true, then the consequent (the splat quanked) must also be true.\n5. The second premise tells us that the consequent (the splat quanked) is true.\n6. Using the rules of logical inference, specifically the rule of modus ponens, we can conclude that the antecedent (the splat was morphed) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
