The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\"\n2. The second statement is a categorical statement: \"The wug was garpled.\"\n3. To infer 'The wug was sproinged' from these two statements, we need to use the rule of modus ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (A \u2192 B) and the antecedent (A) is true, then we can conclude the consequent (B) is true.\n4. In this case, the conditional statement is \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\" The second statement, \"The wug was garpled,\" tells us that the consequent (B) is true.\n5. However, we do not have information about the antecedent (A), which is \"The wug was sproinged.\" We cannot infer the truth of the antecedent from the truth of the consequent alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
