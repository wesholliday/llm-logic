The first premise is 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition 'the flob was skizzled' is true, then the consequence 'the flob movated' is also true.\n\n2. The second premise is 'The flob movated'. This means that the consequence 'the flob movated' is true.\n\n3. From the first premise, we know that if 'the flob was skizzled' is true, then 'the flob movated' is also true. And the second premise tells us that 'the flob movated' is true.\n\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the condition 'the flob was skizzled' must also be true, since the consequence 'the flob movated' is true and the first premise tells us that the condition 'the flob was skizzled' leads to the consequence 'the flob movated'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
