We are given the statement: \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\"\n2. We are also given the statement: \"The flugel was zargled.\"\n3. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the flugel was blimmed) is true, then the consequent (the flugel was zargled) is also true.\n4. Since we are given that the consequent (the flugel was zargled) is true, we can infer that the antecedent (the flugel was blimmed) is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The flugel was blimmed'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
