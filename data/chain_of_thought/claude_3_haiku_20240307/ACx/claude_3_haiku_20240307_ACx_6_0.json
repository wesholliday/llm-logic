We have the statement \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n2. We also have the statement \"The grommet plopped the frink.\"\n3. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition \"the grommet was sploffed\" is true, then the consequence \"the grommet plopped the frink\" is also true.\n4. Since we know that \"the grommet plopped the frink\" is true, we can infer that the condition \"the grommet was sploffed\" must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The grommet was sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
