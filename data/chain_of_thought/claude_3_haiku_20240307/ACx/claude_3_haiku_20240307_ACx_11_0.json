The first statement is \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the flug was blummed, then it was also zimmed.\n\n2. The second statement is \"The flug was zimmed.\" This means that the flug was indeed zimmed.\n\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can infer from these two statements that \"The flug was blummed.\"\n\n4. The first statement tells us that if the flug was blummed, then it was also zimmed. Since we know from the second statement that the flug was zimmed, we can infer that the flug was blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
