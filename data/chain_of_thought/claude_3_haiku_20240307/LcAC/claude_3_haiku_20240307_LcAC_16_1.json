The first premise is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.' This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition on the left-hand side (the shirt was cotton) is true, then the statement on the right-hand side (the pants were denim) must also be true.\n\n2. The second premise is 'The pants were denim.' This is a statement that the right-hand side of the conditional statement is true.\n\n3. Now, the question is whether we can logically conclude that the left-hand side of the conditional statement is also true, i.e., 'The shirt was cotton.'\n\n4. In formal logic, the valid inference from a conditional statement and the truth of the consequent is called 'affirming the consequent.' This type of inference is not valid, as it does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent.\n\nAnswer: no"
