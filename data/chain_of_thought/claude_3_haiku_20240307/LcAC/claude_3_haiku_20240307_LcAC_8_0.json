However, this does not necessarily mean that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was also awake.\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement: \"The mummy was awake.\" This means that the mummy was indeed awake.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n- If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (from the first statement).\n- The mummy was awake (from the second statement).\n\nHowever, we cannot logically conclude from these two statements that the vampire was awake. The first statement only tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake, but it does not provide any information about the state of the vampire.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that the vampire was awake based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
