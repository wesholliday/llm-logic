However, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. Just because the truck was metal, it does not necessarily mean that the doll was plastic.\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement: \"The truck was metal.\" This statement is consistent with the first statement, but it does not provide enough information to conclude that \"The doll was plastic.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically conclude that \"The doll was plastic.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
