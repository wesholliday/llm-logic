However, this does not necessarily mean that if the truck was blue, then the car was red.\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement: \"The truck was blue.\" This statement is consistent with the first statement, as it confirms that the truck was blue.\n\nHowever, the information provided does not allow us to logically conclude that the car was red. The first statement only tells us that if the car was red, then the truck was blue, but it does not tell us anything about the color of the car if the truck is blue.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically conclude that the car was red.\n\nAnswer: no"
