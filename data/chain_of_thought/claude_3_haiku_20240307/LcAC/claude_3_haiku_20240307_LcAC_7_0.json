This means that if Alex finished the race, then it necessarily follows that Chris also finished the race. However, this statement does not tell us anything about whether Alex actually finished the race or not.\n\nThe second statement, \"Chris finished the race,\" provides additional information. This statement tells us that Chris did, in fact, finish the race.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n- If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (from the first statement)\n- Chris did finish the race (from the second statement)\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot logically conclude that Alex finished the race. The first statement only tells us that if Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished the race, but it does not tell us whether Alex actually finished the race or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically conclude that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: no"
