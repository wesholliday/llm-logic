The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that if Mary was at the wedding, then it necessarily follows that Sue was also at the wedding.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple categorical statement: \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that Sue's presence at the wedding is a fact.\n\nNow, let's consider whether we can logically conclude that \"Mary was at the wedding\" from these two statements.\n\nThe second statement, \"Sue was at the wedding,\" confirms that Sue was present at the wedding, which aligns with the conditional statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" However, the second statement does not provide any information about whether Mary was at the wedding or not.\n\nThe conditional statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" only tells us that if Mary was present, then Sue must have been present as well. It does not imply the converse, which would be \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot logically conclude that \"Mary was at the wedding.\" The presence of Sue at the wedding does not necessarily mean that Mary was also present.\n\nAnswer: no"
