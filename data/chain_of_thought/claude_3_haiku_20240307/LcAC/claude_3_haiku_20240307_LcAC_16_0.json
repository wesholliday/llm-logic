The first statement tells us that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n2. The second statement tells us that the pants were denim.\n3. However, the first statement does not tell us anything about the material of the shirt. It only tells us that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n4. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the shirt was cotton based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
