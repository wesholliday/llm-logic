The reason is that the conditional statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" does not necessarily imply that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff must have played basketball.\n\nIn other words, the given information only tells us that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis, but it does not provide any information about the converse, which would be necessary to conclude that Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: no"
