The first statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. However, this statement does not tell us anything about whether Mary was actually at the wedding or not.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a factual statement, which means that Sue was present at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical reasoning:\n- If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (from the first statement).\n- We know that Sue was at the wedding (from the second statement).\n\nHowever, from these two statements, we cannot logically conclude that Mary was at the wedding. The first statement only tells us that if Mary was there, then Sue was there, but it does not tell us whether Mary was actually there or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
