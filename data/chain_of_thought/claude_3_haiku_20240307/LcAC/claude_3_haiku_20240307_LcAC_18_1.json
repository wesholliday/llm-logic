We are asked whether we can logically conclude that the doll was plastic.\n\n3. To answer this, we need to consider the logical structure of the first statement, which is a conditional statement:\n   - If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\n4. This conditional statement is equivalent to the logical statement:\n   - If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\n\n5. We are given that the truck was metal, which means the antecedent of the conditional statement is true.\n\n6. However, the conclusion that the doll was plastic does not necessarily follow from the given information. The fact that the truck was metal does not imply that the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: no"
