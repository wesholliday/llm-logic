The first statement tells us that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n2. The second statement tells us that Jen watched basketball.\n3. From the second statement, we can conclude that the consequence \"Jen watched basketball\" is true.\n4. However, the first statement does not tell us that if Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football. It only tells us that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n5. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that \"Tom watched football\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
