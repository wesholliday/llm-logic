If the consequent is true (Lucy went to the zoo), it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent is also true (Joe went to the park). This is because the conditional statement only tells us that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must be true, but it does not work the other way around.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot logically conclude that \"Joe went to the park.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
