In the first premise, the statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake.\n5. However, the second premise, \"The mummy was awake,\" does not necessarily imply that the vampire was also awake. The first premise only tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake, but it does not tell us anything about the converse.\n6.
