The first statement is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (Sam took a plane) is true, then the second part (Erin took a train) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Erin took a train.\" This is a factual statement, which means that Erin did indeed take a train.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical reasoning:\n\nIf the first statement is true (\"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\") and the second statement is also true (\"Erin took a train\"), then we can conclude that the first part of the conditional statement must also be true, which is \"Sam took a plane.\"\n\nThis is because the second part of the conditional statement (\"Erin took a train\") is known to be true, and the conditional statement tells us that if the second part is true, then the first part must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can logically conclude that \"Sam took a plane.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
