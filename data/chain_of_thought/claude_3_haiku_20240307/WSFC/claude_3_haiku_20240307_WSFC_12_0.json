This statement does not imply that both possibilities are true at the same time.\n\nTo infer \"The candidate might win the election and they might lose the election\" would require the statement to be a conjunctive statement, where both possibilities are true simultaneously. However, the original statement does not provide that information.\n\nAnswer: no"
