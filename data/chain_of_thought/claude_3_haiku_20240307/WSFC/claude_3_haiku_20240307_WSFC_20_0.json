This statement does not imply that the concert will feature both rock and jazz music.\n\nTo infer \"The concert might feature rock music and it might feature jazz music\" would require a stronger statement that explicitly states the concert could feature both rock and jazz music. The original statement only suggests the possibility of one or the other, not necessarily both.\n\nAnswer: no"
