This statement does not imply that both \"The team might win the match\" and \"The team might lose the match\" are true at the same time.\n\nThe statement \"The team might win the match and they might lose the match\" is a conjunction, meaning that both possibilities are true simultaneously. This is a stronger claim than the original disjunction, and it cannot be directly inferred from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
