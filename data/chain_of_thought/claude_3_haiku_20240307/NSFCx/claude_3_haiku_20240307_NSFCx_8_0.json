This statement does not imply that the quimble might be both quazzle and quibble.\n\nTo infer \"The quimble might be quazzle and the quimble might be quibble\" would require a stronger statement, such as \"The quimble might be quazzle and the quimble might be quibble\" or \"The quimble is either quazzle or quibble.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
