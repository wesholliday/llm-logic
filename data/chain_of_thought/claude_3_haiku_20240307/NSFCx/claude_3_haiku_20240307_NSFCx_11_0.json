It does not imply that the wobble might be both quorple and snork.\n\nIn order to infer 'The wobble might be quorple and the wobble might be snork', we would need to have additional information that explicitly states that the wobble could be both quorple and snork. The given statement does not provide this information.\n\nAnswer: no"
