This statement does not provide any information about whether the wozzle must be specifically flibbit blimple. The statement only indicates that the wozzle must be one of the two options, but does not specify that it must be the second option (flibbit blimple). Therefore, from the given information, we cannot infer that \"The wozzle must be flibbit blimple\".\n\nAnswer: no"
