This statement does not necessarily imply that both outcomes are possible simultaneously.\n\nTo infer \"The train might be early and the train might be late\" from the original statement, we would need to have additional information that explicitly states that both outcomes are possible. The original statement only presents the two possibilities as alternatives, not as simultaneous outcomes.\n\nAnswer: no"
