This statement does not imply that both \"The team might win the match\" and \"The team might lose the match\" are true at the same time.\n\nThe statement \"The team might win the match and the team might lose the match\" is a conjunctive statement, which means that both possibilities are true simultaneously. However, this cannot be directly inferred from the original disjunctive statement.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer \"The team might win the match and the team might lose the match\" from the given statement \"The team might win or lose the match\"."
