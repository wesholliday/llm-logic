This statement does not imply that Tom will buy both a car and a motorcycle. \n\nTo infer \"Tom might buy a car and Tom might buy a motorcycle\" from the given statement, we would need to have additional information that suggests Tom is considering both options. The original statement only indicates that Tom is considering one or the other, not necessarily both.\n\nAnswer: no"
