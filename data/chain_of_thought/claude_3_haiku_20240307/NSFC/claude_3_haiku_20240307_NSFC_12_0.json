This statement does not imply that both \"The candidate might win the election\" and \"The candidate might lose the election\" are true at the same time.\n\nThe original statement only suggests that the candidate has a chance of winning or a chance of losing, but it does not necessarily mean that both outcomes are possible. It could be the case that the candidate either wins or loses, but not both.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from the given statement that \"The candidate might win the election and the candidate might lose the election\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
