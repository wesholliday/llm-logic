This statement does not imply that Sarah might study both biology and chemistry.\n\nTo infer \"Sarah might study biology and Sarah might study chemistry\" from the given statement, we would need to have additional information that suggests Sarah is considering both options. The original statement only indicates that she is considering one or the other, not both.\n\nAnswer: no"
