This statement does not imply that the movie might be both a comedy and a drama.\n\nTo infer \"The movie might be a comedy and the movie might be a drama\" from the given statement would be an invalid inference, as it would be strengthening the original statement to a conjunctive statement, which is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
