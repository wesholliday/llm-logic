The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement and has the form 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be 'If the twonk was not varnished, then it was not plinked'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the twonk was not plinked, then it was not varnished' from the given statement 'If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
