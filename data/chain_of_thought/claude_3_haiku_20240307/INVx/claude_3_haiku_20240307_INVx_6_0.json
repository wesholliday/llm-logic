In other words, \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed\".\n\nThis is logically equivalent to the statement \"If the grommet was not sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink\".\n\nTherefore, we can infer the desired statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
