The contrapositive is also a conditional statement in the form \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be: \"If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled.\"\n\nThis statement is logically equivalent to the statement \"If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink' from the given statement 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
