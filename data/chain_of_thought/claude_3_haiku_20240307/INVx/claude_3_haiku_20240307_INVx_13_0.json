The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement and has the form 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be 'If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the glip was not slogged, then the glip was not tragged' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
