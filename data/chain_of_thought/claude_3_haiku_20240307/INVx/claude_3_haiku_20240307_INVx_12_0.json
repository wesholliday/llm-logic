This would result in the statement \"If not A, then not B\".\n\nIn this case, the negation of \"the smip was shripped\" is \"the smip was not shripped\", and the negation of \"the smip lupped the zoint\" is \"the smip did not lup the zoint\".\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement would be: \"If the smip was not shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
