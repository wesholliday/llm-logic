The converse would be 'If the grommet was not sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink'.\n\nIn other words, the original statement does not provide enough information to determine the truth value of the converse. It is possible that the grommet did not plop the frink even if it was sploffed, or the grommet could have plopped the frink even if it was not sploffed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the grommet was not sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
