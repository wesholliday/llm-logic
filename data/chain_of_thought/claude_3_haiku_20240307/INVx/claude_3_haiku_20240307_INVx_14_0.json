The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement and has the form 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be 'If the clug was not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
