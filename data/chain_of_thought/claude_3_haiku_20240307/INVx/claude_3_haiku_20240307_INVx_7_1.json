This is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the whiffle was shanked) is true, then the second part (the whiffle tinked) must also be true.\n3. We are asked to infer whether the following statement is true: \"If the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink.\"\n4. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is a logically equivalent statement, where the antecedent and consequent are negated.\n5. In other words, if the whiffle was not shanked, then it did not tink.\n6. The contrapositive of a true conditional statement is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
