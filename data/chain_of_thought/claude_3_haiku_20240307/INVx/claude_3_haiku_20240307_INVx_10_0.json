The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement and has the form 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be 'If the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled' from the given statement 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
