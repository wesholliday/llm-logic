It states that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. This does not necessarily imply the converse statement 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red'.\n\nThe converse of a conditional statement is not always true, even if the original statement is true. The converse of a conditional statement is a different logical statement that requires separate verification.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red'.\n\nAnswer: no"
