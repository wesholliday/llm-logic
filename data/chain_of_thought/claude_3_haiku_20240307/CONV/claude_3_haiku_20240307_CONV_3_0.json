The converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true, even if the original statement is true.\n\nIn other words, just because the statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is true, it does not necessarily mean that the converse statement \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James\" is also true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
