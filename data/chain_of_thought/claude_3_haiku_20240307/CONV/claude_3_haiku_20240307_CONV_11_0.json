The converse of 'If P, then Q' is 'If Q, then P'.\n\nTo determine if the converse is valid, we need to consider the truth table for the conditional statement. In a valid conditional statement, the converse is not always true, even if the original statement is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate' from the original statement 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry'.\n\nAnswer: no"
