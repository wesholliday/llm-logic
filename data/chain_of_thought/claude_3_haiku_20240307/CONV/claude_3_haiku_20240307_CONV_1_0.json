            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding' from the given statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe given statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement. It states that if the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequent (Sue was at the wedding) is also true.\n\nTo infer the converse of the given statement, we need to check if the logical relationship between the antecedent and consequent can be reversed. In other words, we need to determine if 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding' is a valid inference.\n\nHowever, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. The fact that 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is true does not guarantee that 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding' is also true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding' from the given statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer: no"
