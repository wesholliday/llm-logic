It can be represented as:\n\nIf Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\nOr, in symbolic form: A \u2192 C\n\nTo infer the statement 'If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race', we need to check if the converse of the original statement is valid.\n\nThe converse of the statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' is:\n\nIf Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race.\nOr, in symbolic form: C \u2192 A\n\nHowever, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true, even if the original statement is true. The converse may or may not be true, depending on the specific situation.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race' from the given statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race'.\n\nAnswer: no"
