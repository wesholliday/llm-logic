The validity of the converse depends on the logical relationship between the antecedent and the consequent.\n\nIn this case, the given statement is a one-way implication, meaning that the presence of the griffin in the forest implies the presence of the unicorn in the forest, but the presence of the unicorn in the forest does not necessarily imply the presence of the griffin in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
