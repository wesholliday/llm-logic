It means that if the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) is true, then the consequent (Amy played tennis) is also true.\n\nHowever, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. The converse of the given statement would be 'If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball'.\n\nIn general, the converse of a conditional statement is not automatically true, even if the original statement is true. Additional information or assumptions would be needed to infer the converse.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball'.\n\nAnswer: no"
