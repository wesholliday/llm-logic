The converse of this statement would be 'If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars'.\n\nHowever, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true, even if the original statement is true. The converse of a conditional statement is a logically distinct statement that may or may not be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars' from the given statement 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter'.\n\nAnswer: no"
