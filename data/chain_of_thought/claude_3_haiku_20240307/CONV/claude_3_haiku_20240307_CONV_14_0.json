The converse of a conditional statement is the statement formed by interchanging the antecedent and the consequent.\n\nThe converse of the given statement would be:\nIf the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case.\n\nHowever, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true, even if the original statement is true. This is because the truth of the original statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case' from the given statement 'If the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den'.\n\nAnswer: no"
