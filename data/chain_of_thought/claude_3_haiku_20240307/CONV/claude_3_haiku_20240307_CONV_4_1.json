This means that if the alien visited Mars (A), then the robot visited Jupiter (B).\n\nTo infer the opposite conditional statement, we need to consider the logical implication. The opposite conditional statement would be in the form \"If B, then A\".\n\nHowever, the logical implication does not necessarily work in the opposite direction. Just because the robot visited Jupiter (B), it does not necessarily mean that the alien visited Mars (A). This is known as the fallacy of the converse.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars' from the given statement 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter'.\n\nAnswer: no"
