It states that if one condition is true (Sue chose pizza), then another condition is also true (Bob chose pasta).\n\nTo infer the opposite conditional statement, 'If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza', we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nIn general, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. The converse of 'If A, then B' is 'If B, then A', and this is not always valid.\n\nIn this case, the converse of the given statement would be 'If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza'. However, we cannot infer this statement from the original statement alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no"
