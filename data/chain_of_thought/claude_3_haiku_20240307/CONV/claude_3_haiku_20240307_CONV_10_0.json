The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be 'If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside'. This is logically equivalent to 'If the cat was inside, then the dog was outside'.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside' from the given statement 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside'.\n\nAnswer: no"
