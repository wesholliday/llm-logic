            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt' from the given statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and Q is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nThe question is asking whether we can infer the converse of the given statement, which is 'If Q, then P'.\n\nIn general, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true, even if the original statement is true. This is because the logical relationship between the antecedent (P) and the consequent (Q) does not necessarily work in the opposite direction.\n\nIn this case, the given statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' does not guarantee that 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt' is also true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
