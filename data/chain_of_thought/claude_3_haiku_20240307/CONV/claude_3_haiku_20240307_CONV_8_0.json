It states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake. This means that the vampire being awake is a sufficient condition for the mummy to be awake.\n\nHowever, the converse of this statement, 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake', is not necessarily true. The mummy being awake is not a sufficient condition for the vampire to be awake. It is possible that the mummy could be awake while the vampire is not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake' from the given statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake'.\n\nAnswer: no"
