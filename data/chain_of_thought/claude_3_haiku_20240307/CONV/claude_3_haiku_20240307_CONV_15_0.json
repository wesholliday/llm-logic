It states that if the antecedent (Sam took a plane) is true, then the consequent (Erin took a train) is also true.\n\nHowever, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. The converse of 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' would be 'If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane'.\n\nIn general, the converse of a conditional statement is not automatically true, and we cannot infer the converse from the original statement without additional information.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane'.\n\nAnswer: no"
