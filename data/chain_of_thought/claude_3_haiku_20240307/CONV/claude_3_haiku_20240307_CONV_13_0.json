            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If the truck was blue, then the car was red' from the given statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue', we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe given statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' is a conditional statement. It states that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. This means that the car being red is the sufficient condition for the truck to be blue.\n\nHowever, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. The inverse of 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' would be 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red'. This is not the same as the statement 'If the truck was blue, then the car was red'.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the truck was blue, then the car was red' from the given statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'.\n\nAnswer: no"
