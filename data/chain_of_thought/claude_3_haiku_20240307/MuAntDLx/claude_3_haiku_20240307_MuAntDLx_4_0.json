However, the question asks whether we can infer \"The quorple must be at grooble frazzle\" from this statement. \n\nIn a disjunctive statement, if one of the conditions is true, we cannot automatically infer that the other condition is also true. The statement \"The quorple must be at grooble frazzle or snork\" allows for the possibility that the quorple could be at grooble frazzle, or it could be at snork, or it could be at both grooble frazzle and snork.\n\nTherefore, from the given statement, we cannot infer that \"The quorple must be at grooble frazzle\" is true. The original statement does not provide enough information to make that specific inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
