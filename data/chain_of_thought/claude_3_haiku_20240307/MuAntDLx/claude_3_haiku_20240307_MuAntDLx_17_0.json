This statement does not provide any information about whether the frazzle must be frazzle or not. It only states that the frazzle must be either frazzle or gribble.\n\nTo infer \"The frazzle must be frazzle\" from the given statement, we would need additional information or a stronger logical connection between the two statements. The given statement does not provide enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: No"
