From this statement, we cannot infer that \"The floob must be snorkel\" because the statement allows for the possibility that the floob could be frazzle. The disjunctive statement does not provide enough information to determine which of the two options is true. To infer that \"The floob must be snorkel,\" we would need additional information that specifically states that the floob is snorkel.\n\nAnswer: no"
