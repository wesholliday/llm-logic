Since the statement uses the conjunction \"and\" to connect these two verbs, it suggests that both actions, \"snorking\" and \"wumbling\", are being performed on the quibble.\n\nTherefore, from the given statement, we can infer that \"The quibble might be wumbled\", as \"wumbling\" is one of the actions mentioned in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
