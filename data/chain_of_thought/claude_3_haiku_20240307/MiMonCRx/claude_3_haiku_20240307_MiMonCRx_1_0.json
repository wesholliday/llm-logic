            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The flibbit might be zorped and gribbled\" does not provide enough information to infer the statement \"The flibbit might be gribbled\". The original statement mentions two actions, \"zorped\" and \"gribbled\", which are applied to the flibbit. From this, we cannot conclude that the flibbit is necessarily gribbled, as the original statement indicates that both actions might be applied, not that they are mutually exclusive.\n\nAnswer: no"
