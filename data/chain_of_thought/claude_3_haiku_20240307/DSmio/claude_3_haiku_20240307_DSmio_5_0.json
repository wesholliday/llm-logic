'The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry' implies that the cookies may or may not be in the pantry.\n2. 'Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry' means that the cookies are either in the jar or hidden in the pantry.\n\nNow, considering these two statements together, we can conclude that if the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, then they must be in the jar. This is because the second statement eliminates the possibility of the cookies being anywhere else other than the jar or the pantry.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that 'The cookies are in the jar'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
