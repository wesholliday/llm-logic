The first premise is 'The pen might not be on my desk'. This means that the pen may or may not be on the desk.\n\n2. The second premise is 'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk'. This means that the pen is either in the bag or on the desk, but not both.\n\nNow, let's consider the two possibilities:\n- If the pen is not on the desk (as stated in the first premise), then it must be in the bag (as stated in the second premise).\n- If the pen is on the desk, then it cannot be in the bag (as stated in the second premise).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
