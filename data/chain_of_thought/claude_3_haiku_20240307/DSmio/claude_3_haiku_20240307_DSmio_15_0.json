We have the following two premises:\n   - \"The shoes might not be lined up by the door\"\n   - \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door\"\n\n2. The first premise tells us that the shoes might not be lined up by the door. This means that the shoes could be somewhere else, such as in the closet.\n\n3. The second premise gives us two possibilities: either the shoes are in the closet, or they are lined up by the door.\n\n4. Since the first premise tells us that the shoes might not be lined up by the door, the only remaining possibility is that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes"
