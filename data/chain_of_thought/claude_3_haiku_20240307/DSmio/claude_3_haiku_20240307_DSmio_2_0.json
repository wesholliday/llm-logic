We are given the following two statements:\n   - \"The book might not be resting on the table\"\n   - \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\"\n\n2. The first statement tells us that the book might not be on the table. This means that the book could be somewhere else, such as on the shelf.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that the book is either on the shelf or on the table. Since the first statement suggests that the book is not on the table, the only other possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes"
