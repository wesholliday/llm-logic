We have the statement: \"The watch might not be on his wrist.\"\n2. We also have the statement: \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\"\n3. The second statement implies that the watch can only be in one of two places: on the dresser or on his wrist.\n4. The first statement, \"The watch might not be on his wrist,\" suggests that the watch is not on his wrist.\n5. If the watch is not on his wrist, and it can only be on the dresser or on his wrist, then the only remaining possibility is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes"
