The first premise states that 'The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor'.\n2. The second premise states that 'Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor'.\n3. Assuming the first premise is true, it means that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor.\n4.
