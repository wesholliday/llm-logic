The first statement is 'The cat might not be playing in the bedroom'. This means that the cat may or may not be playing in the bedroom.\n\n2. The second statement is 'Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom'. This means that the cat is either napping on the couch or playing in the bedroom, but not both.\n\n3. Now, if the cat is not playing in the bedroom (as per the first statement), then the only other possibility is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The cat is napping on the couch'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
