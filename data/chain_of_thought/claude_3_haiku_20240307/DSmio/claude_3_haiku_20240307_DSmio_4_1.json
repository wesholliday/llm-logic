The first premise states: 'The cat might not be playing in the bedroom'.\n2. The second premise states: 'Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom'.\n3. The second premise provides two possible scenarios for the cat's location: either it is napping on the couch or it is playing in the bedroom.\n4. The first premise suggests that the cat is not playing in the bedroom.\n5. Since the second premise states that the cat must be either napping on the couch or playing in the bedroom, and the first premise rules out the cat playing in the bedroom, the only remaining possibility is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes"
