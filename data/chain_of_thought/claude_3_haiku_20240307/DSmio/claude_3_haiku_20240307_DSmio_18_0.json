We are given the following two statements:\n   - \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\"\n   - \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\"\n\n2. The first statement tells us that the notebook might not be on the nightstand. This means that the notebook could be somewhere else, such as in the drawer.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that the notebook is either in the drawer or on the nightstand. Since the first statement suggests that the notebook is not on the nightstand, the only remaining possibility is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
