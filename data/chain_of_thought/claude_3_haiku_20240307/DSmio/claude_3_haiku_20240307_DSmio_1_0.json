We are also given the statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\".\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that if Fido is not in the garden, then Fido must be inside.\n4. The first statement, \"Fido might not be in the garden\", implies that Fido is not necessarily in the garden.\n5. Combining the two statements, we can conclude that if Fido is not in the garden, then Fido must be inside.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
