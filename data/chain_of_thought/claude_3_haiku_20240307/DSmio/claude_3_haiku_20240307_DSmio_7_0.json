The first statement is 'The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet'. This means that the umbrella may or may not be in the closet.\n\n2. The second statement is 'Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet'. This means that the umbrella is either in the car or in the closet, but not both.\n\n3. Combining the two statements, we can conclude that if the umbrella is not in the closet, then it must be in the car. This is because the second statement eliminates the possibility of the umbrella being anywhere else.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The umbrella is in the car'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
