This statement does not provide any information about the location of the sock.\n\nThe second statement, \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed,\" presents two possible mutually exclusive locations for the missing sock: either in the laundry basket or under the bed.\n\nNow, if we consider the combination of the two given statements, we can see that the first statement does not rule out the possibility of the sock being in the laundry basket.
