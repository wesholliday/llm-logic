We are given the statement 'The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet'.\n2. We are also given the statement 'Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet'.\n3. The second statement implies that the keys must be either in the drawer or dangling in the cabinet. There are no other possibilities.\n4. The first statement tells us that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet.\n5. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes"
