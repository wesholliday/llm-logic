If the remote control is not hiding under the couch (as stated in the first statement), then the only other possibility, according to the second statement, is that it must be on the coffee table.\n2. If the remote control is not on the coffee table, then it must be hiding under the couch, according to the second statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
