'The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor' implies that the missing puzzle piece may or may not be on the floor.\n2. 'Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor' means that the missing puzzle piece is either in the box or on the floor.\n\nNow, let's consider the two possibilities:\n- If the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor (as stated in the first statement), then it must be in the box, as the second statement suggests.\n- If the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor, then it cannot be in the box, as the second statement also suggests.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can infer that 'The missing puzzle piece is in the box'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
