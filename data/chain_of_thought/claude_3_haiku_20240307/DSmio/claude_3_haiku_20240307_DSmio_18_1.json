This means that the notebook may or may not be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nThe second piece of information is 'Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.' This means that the notebook is either in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand.\n\nNow, let's consider the two possibilities:\n\n1. If the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand (as stated in the first piece of information), then the second piece of information tells us that the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\n2. If the notebook is sitting on the nightstand, then the second piece of information also allows for this possibility.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The notebook is in the drawer.'\n\nAnswer: yes"
