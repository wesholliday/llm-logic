We are given the statement: 'The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack'.\n2. We are also given the statement: 'Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack'.\n3. From the second statement, we can infer that if the scarf is not draped on the coat rack, then it must be stuffed in the backpack.\n4. Since the first statement tells us that the scarf 'might not be draped on the coat rack', we can infer that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes"
