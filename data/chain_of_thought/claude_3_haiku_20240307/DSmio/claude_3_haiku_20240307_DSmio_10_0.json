We are given the following two premises:\n   - \"The missing sock might not be under the bed\"\n   - \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed\"\n\n2. The first premise tells us that the missing sock might not be under the bed. This means that it is possible that the missing sock is not under the bed.\n\n3. The second premise tells us that the missing sock must either be in the laundry basket or under the bed. Since the first premise tells us that the missing sock might not be under the bed, the only other possibility is that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes"
