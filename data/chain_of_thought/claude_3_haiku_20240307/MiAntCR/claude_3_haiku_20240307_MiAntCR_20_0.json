Tickets can be required for various types of events, both formal and informal. The requirement of tickets alone does not provide enough information to infer that the event is formal. There could be many reasons why an event might require tickets, such as crowd control, limited capacity, or to generate revenue, without it being a formal event.\n\nAnswer: no"
