            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document might be notarized\" does not necessarily imply that the document is also signed. Notarization is the process of having a document certified by a notary public, which typically involves the signer's signature being witnessed and verified by the notary. However, a document can be signed without being notarized, and a document can also be notarized without necessarily being signed.\n\nTherefore, the inference that \"The document might be signed and notarized\" cannot be made solely from the statement \"The document might be notarized.\" The original statement only indicates the possibility of the document being notarized, but does not provide any information about whether the document is also signed.\n\nAnswer: no"
