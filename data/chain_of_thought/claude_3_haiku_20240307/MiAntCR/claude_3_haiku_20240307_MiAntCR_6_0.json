The statement only suggests that the concert might start at 8 PM, but it does not make any claims about the concert's ticket availability or whether it is sold out. To infer that the concert might be sold out and start at 8 PM, we would need additional information beyond just the statement \"The concert might start at 8 PM\".\n\nAnswer: no"
