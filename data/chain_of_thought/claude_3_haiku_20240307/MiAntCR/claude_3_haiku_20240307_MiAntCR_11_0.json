The statement only suggests that the software might be restarted, but it does not provide any information about whether the software will be updated prior to the restart.\n\nTo infer that the software might be updated and then restarted, we would need additional information or context that explicitly mentions the software being updated. The given statement alone does not provide enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
