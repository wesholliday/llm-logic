The statement only suggests that the exam might cover all the chapters, but it does not provide any information about the difficulty level of the exam.\n\nTo infer that the exam might be difficult and cover all chapters, we would need additional information or context that suggests the exam will be challenging or comprehensive. The original statement alone does not provide enough information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
