The phrase \"might be signed for\" suggests that there is a possibility that the package will be signed for, but it does not provide any information about the timing of the delivery.\n\nThe statement only indicates that there is a possibility of the package being signed for, but it does not specify when the signing might occur. The package could be delivered and signed for today, or it could be delivered and signed for on a different day.\n\nWithout additional information about the expected delivery date or timeline, we cannot infer that the package \"might be delivered today and signed for\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
