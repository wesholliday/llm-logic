This statement does not rule out the possibility that Mary was at the wedding, but it leaves it open as a possibility.\n\nThe conclusion \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" means that it is not necessarily true that Mary was at the wedding. This conclusion is consistent with the premise, as the premise already stated that Mary might not have been at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, the given argument, where the premise is \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" and the conclusion is \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding,\" is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
