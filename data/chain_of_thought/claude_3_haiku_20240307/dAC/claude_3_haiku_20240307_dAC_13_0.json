However, this does not necessarily mean that if the truck was blue, then the car was red.\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement: \"The truck was blue.\" This statement is consistent with the first statement, as it confirms that the truck was blue.\n\nNow, the question is whether we can deduce that \"The car was red\" from the given information.\n\nThe key point here is that the first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it only tells us something about the relationship between the car being red and the truck being blue, but it does not necessarily work the other way around.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot deduce that \"The car was red.\" The first statement does not provide enough information to make that conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
