The problem is that we cannot make this deduction based solely on the given information. Even though we know that the consequent of the first statement is true (Lucy went to the zoo), we cannot infer that the antecedent is also true (Joe went to the park).\n\nThis is because the first statement is a conditional statement, and the truth of the consequent does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent.
