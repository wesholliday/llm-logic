The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This means that if Alex finished the race, then it necessarily follows that Chris also finished the race.\n\n2. The second statement is a categorical statement: \"Chris finished the race.\" This means that Chris did, in fact, finish the race.\n\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can deduce that \"Alex finished the race\" from the given information.\n\n4. Since we know that \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" and we also know that \"Chris finished the race,\" we can apply the rule of modus ponens to conclude that \"Alex finished the race.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
