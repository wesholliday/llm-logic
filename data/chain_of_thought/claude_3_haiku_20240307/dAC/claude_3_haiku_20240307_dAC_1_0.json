Specifically, we can use the rule of modus ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is true, then we can conclude that P is also true.\n\nIn this case, we have the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" (i.e., \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\") and we know that Q is true (i.e., \"Sue was at the wedding\"). Therefore, we can conclude that P is also true (i.e., \"Mary was at the wedding\").\n\nAnswer: yes"
