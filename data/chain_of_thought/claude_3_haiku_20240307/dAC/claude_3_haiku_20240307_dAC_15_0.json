The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This means that if the condition \"Sam took a plane\" is true, then the conclusion \"Erin took a train\" must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Erin took a train.\" This means that the conclusion \"Erin took a train\" is true.\n\n3. Now, we need to determine if we can deduce the original condition \"Sam took a plane\" from the given information.\n\n4. The conditional statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" does not allow us to deduce the original condition \"Sam took a plane\" from the conclusion \"Erin took a train.\" This is because the conditional statement only tells us that if the condition is true, then the conclusion is true, but it does not tell us that if the conclusion is true, then the condition must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot deduce that \"Sam took a plane.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
