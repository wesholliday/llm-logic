However, this does not necessarily mean that if the mummy was awake, the vampire was also awake.\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement: \"The mummy was awake.\" This means that the mummy was indeed awake.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"From 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' together with 'The mummy was awake', can we deduce 'The vampire was awake'?\"\n\nTo deduce that the vampire was awake, we would need to know that the mummy being awake necessarily implies that the vampire was also awake. However, the given information does not provide this implication. The first statement only tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake, but it does not tell us the reverse.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot deduce that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: no"
