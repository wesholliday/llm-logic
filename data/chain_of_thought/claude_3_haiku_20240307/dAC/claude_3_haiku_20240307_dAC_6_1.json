The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This means that if Sue chose pizza, then it necessarily follows that Bob chose pasta.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"Bob chose pasta.\" This means that Bob did indeed choose pasta.\n\n3. Now, we can use the information from the second statement (\"Bob chose pasta\") to draw a conclusion about the first statement. Since we know that Bob chose pasta, and the first statement says that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta, we can deduce that Sue must have chosen pizza.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
