However, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. Just because the muffins were blueberry, it does not necessarily mean that the cake was chocolate.\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement: \"The muffins were blueberry.\" This statement is true, but it does not provide any information about the cake.\n\nGiven the information provided, we cannot deduce that \"The cake was chocolate.\" The first statement only tells us that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry, but it does not tell us anything about the actual state of the cake.\n\nAnswer: no"
