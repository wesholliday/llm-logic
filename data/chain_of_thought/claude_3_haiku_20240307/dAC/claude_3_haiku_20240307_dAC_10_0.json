The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This means that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the cat was outside, then the dog was inside.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"The cat was outside.\" This means that the cat was indeed outside.\n\n3. From the first statement, we know that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. Since we know the cat was outside, we can infer that the dog was inside.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can deduce that the dog was inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
