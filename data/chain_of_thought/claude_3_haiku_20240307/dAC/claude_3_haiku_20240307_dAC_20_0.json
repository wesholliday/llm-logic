This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the apple was red) is true, then the consequent (the banana was yellow) must also be true.\n3. We are also given the statement \"The banana was yellow.\"\n4. From the second statement, we know that the consequent of the first statement is true.\n5. However, we cannot deduce that the antecedent of the first statement is also true. This is because the conditional statement only tells us that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must be true, but it does not tell us that if the consequent is true, then the antecedent must also be true.\n6. Therefore, we cannot deduce that \"The apple was red\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
