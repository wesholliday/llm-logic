However, this statement does not directly tell us whether the doll was actually plastic or not.\n\nThe second statement tells us that \"The truck was metal.\" This is a direct statement about the material of the truck, and it aligns with the conditional statement from the first statement.\n\nNow, the question is whether we can deduce that \"The doll was plastic\" from the given information.\n\nTo deduce this, we would need to use the contrapositive of the first statement, which is: \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\" Since we know that the truck was metal, the contrapositive statement does not apply, and we cannot conclude that the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: no"
