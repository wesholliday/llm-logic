This is a direct statement that B is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can deduce that A is true, which in this case is \"Sam took a plane\".\n\nThe logical rule that applies here is called modus ponens. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is true, then we can conclude that A is also true.\n\nIn this case, we have the conditional statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\", and we know that Erin took a train (the second premise).
