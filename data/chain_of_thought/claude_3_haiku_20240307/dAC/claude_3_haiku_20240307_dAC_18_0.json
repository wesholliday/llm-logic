            "content": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the given information and the logical implications.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This means that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. However, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. Just because the truck was metal, it does not necessarily mean that the doll was plastic.\n\nThe second statement is a simple statement: \"The truck was metal.\" This statement is consistent with the first statement, as it confirms that the truck was metal.\n\nNow, the question is whether we can deduce that \"The doll was plastic\" from the given information.\n\nThe first statement tells us that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. The second statement tells us that the truck was metal. However, this does not necessarily mean that the doll was plastic. There could be other possible scenarios where the truck was metal, but the doll was not plastic.\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce that \"The doll was plastic\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
