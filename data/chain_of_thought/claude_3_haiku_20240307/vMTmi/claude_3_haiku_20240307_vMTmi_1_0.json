            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following structure:\nPremise 1: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\nPremise 2: Sue might not have been at the wedding.\nConclusion: Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nLet's consider the logical validity of this argument:\n\nThe first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequent (Sue must have been at the wedding) must also be true.\n\nThe second premise states that Sue might not have been at the wedding. This means that the consequent of the first premise (Sue must have been at the wedding) is not necessarily true.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" This conclusion does not necessarily follow from the given premises. Even if Sue might not have been at the wedding (second premise), it does not logically imply that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
