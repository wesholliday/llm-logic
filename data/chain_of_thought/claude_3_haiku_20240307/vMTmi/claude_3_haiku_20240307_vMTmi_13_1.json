This is a conditional statement, which means that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. \n\n2) The second premise is \"The truck might not have been blue\". This contradicts the first premise, as it suggests that the truck might not have been blue, even if the car was red.\n\n3) The conclusion is \"The car was not red\". This conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.
