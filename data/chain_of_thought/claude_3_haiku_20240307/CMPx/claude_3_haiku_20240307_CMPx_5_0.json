    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fraglen, a darpil, and a votal are the top bispil teams this season. The fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, while the votal trails far behind. These lead the league, so if the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn\u2019t, the votal will. Moreover, the fraglen likely will lead the league and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fraglen doesn\u2019t lead the league, the votal will?",

            "content": "Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given that the fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, while the votal trails far behind.\n2) We are also told that the fraglen and darpil lead the league, so if the darpil doesn't have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn't, the votal will.\n3) Additionally, we are told that the fraglen likely will lead the league, and hence the darpil likely won't.\n4) The question is asking whether it follows that if the fraglen doesn't lead the league, the votal will.\n5) Based on the information provided, if the fraglen doesn't lead the league, that means the darpil must have the top record. \n6) However, the question states that if the darpil doesn't have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn't, the votal will.\n7) Therefore, if the fraglen doesn't lead the league, it follows that the votal will.\n\nAnswer: yes"
