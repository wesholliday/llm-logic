    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a blimfet, a crongle, and a narzil are the leading bafwidgers. Experts expect the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most this year, followed by the crongle, with the narzil bafwidging much less. These are the only major bafwidgers, so if the crongle doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, then if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most. Moreover, the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most, and hence the crongle likely won\u2019t bafwidge the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will?",

Experts expect the blimfet to bafwidge the most, followed by the crongle, with the narzil bafwidging much less.\n3. These are the only major bafwidgers, so if the crongle doesn't bafwidge the most, then if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most.\n4. Moreover, the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most, and hence the crongle likely won't bafwidge the most.\n5. The question is asking whether it follows that if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, the narzil will.\n6. Given the information provided, if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, then the crongle also won't bafwidge the most. And since these are the only major bafwidgers, the narzil must bafwidge the most.\n\nAnswer: yes"
