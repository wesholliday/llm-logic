    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trendel, a laxum, and a doffen are candidates for Best Ploggel at the National Zorple Championship. Handlers consider the trendel the frontrunner for Best Ploggel, followed by the laxum, while the doffen is a long shot to win. Since these are the only contenders, if the laxum doesn\u2019t win Best Ploggel, then if the trendel doesn\u2019t win, the doffen will win. Moreover, the trendel likely will win Best Ploggel and hence the laxum likely won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trendel doesn\u2019t win Best Ploggel, the doffen will?",

            "content": "Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given that the trendel is the frontrunner for Best Ploggel, followed by the laxum, while the doffen is a long shot to win.\n2. We are also told that if the laxum doesn't win Best Ploggel, then if the trendel doesn't win, the doffen will win.\n3. Additionally, we are told that the trendel likely will win Best Ploggel and hence the laxum likely won't win.\n4. The question is asking whether it follows that if the trendel doesn't win Best Ploggel, the doffen will likely win.\n5. Given the information provided, if the trendel doesn't win, then the laxum also likely won't win. And if the laxum doesn't win, then the doffen will win.\n6. Therefore, if the trendel doesn't win Best Ploggel, it is likely that the doffen will win.\n\nAnswer: yes"
