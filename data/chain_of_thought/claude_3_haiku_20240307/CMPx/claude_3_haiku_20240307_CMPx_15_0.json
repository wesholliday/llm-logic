    "user_prompt": "Suppose a fantole, a dribban, and a snorpul have the best odds to win this season's Rizzle Cup. Oddsmakers believe it's most probable the fantole will capture the cup, followed by the dribban, while the snorpul is a heavy longshot. Since these are the only top contenders, if the dribban doesn\u2019t win the cup, then if the fantole doesn\u2019t win, the snorpul will win. Moreover, the fantole likely will win the cup and hence the dribban likely won't win. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning; then when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Make sure not to answer with 'Answer:' until *after* you think step by step and explain your reasoning.",

            "content": "Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:\n\n1) We are given that the fantole is the most likely to win the Rizzle Cup, followed by the dribban, while the snorpul is a heavy longshot.\n2) We are also told that if the dribban doesn't win, and the fantole doesn't win, then the snorpul will win.\n3) Additionally, we are told that the fantole is likely to win the cup, and hence the dribban is likely not to win.\n4) The question is asking whether it follows that if the fantole doesn't win, the snorpul is likely to win.\n5) Given the information provided, this does not necessarily follow. Just because the fantole is likely to win, and the dribban is likely not to win, it does not mean that if the fantole doesn't win, the snorpul will win.\n6) There could be other possibilities, such as an unexpected outcome where a different competitor wins.\n\nAnswer: No"
