            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The project might be completed by Friday or extended\" presents two possible outcomes for the project: it might be completed by Friday, or it might be extended. The key word here is \"or\", which suggests that these are mutually exclusive possibilities - the project will either be completed by Friday or it will be extended, but not both.\n\nFrom this information, we can infer that the project might be extended. The statement does not rule out the possibility of the project being extended, and in fact, it explicitly mentions that as one of the potential outcomes.\n\nAnswer: yes"
