This statement does not provide any information about the likelihood or probability of the package being delivered on any specific day.\n\nTo infer that \"The package might be delivered tomorrow\" from the given statement, we would need to assume that the package has an equal chance of being delivered on either day. However, the original statement does not provide any information about the relative probabilities of the package being delivered on each day.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The package might be delivered tomorrow\" from the given statement, as the original statement does not specify the likelihood of the package being delivered on any particular day.\n\nAnswer: no"
