This statement does not provide any information about the likelihood or probability of the exam being easy.\n\nTo infer that \"The exam might be easy\" from the given statement, we would need to determine that the exam being easy is one of the possible outcomes. Since the given statement presents the exam being difficult or easy as two possible outcomes, we can infer that the exam might be easy.\n\nAnswer: yes"
