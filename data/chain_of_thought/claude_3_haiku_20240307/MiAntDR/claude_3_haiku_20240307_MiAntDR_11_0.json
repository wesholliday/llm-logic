The key word here is \"or\", which indicates that these are two separate and distinct possibilities.\n\nFrom this statement, we can infer that the software might be reinstalled, as this is one of the two possibilities mentioned. However, we cannot infer that the software will definitely be reinstalled, as the statement only suggests that it \"might\" be reinstalled, not that it will be.\n\nAnswer: yes"
