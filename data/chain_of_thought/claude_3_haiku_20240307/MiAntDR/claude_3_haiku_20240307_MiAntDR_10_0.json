            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document might be signed or notarized\" is a disjunction, meaning that the document could either be signed or notarized, or both. This means that if the document is notarized, it must also be signed, as notarization requires a signature. However, the reverse is not necessarily true - a document could be signed without being notarized.\n\nTherefore, from the given statement, we can infer that if the document might be signed or notarized, then it might be notarized, but we cannot infer that the document must be notarized.\n\nAnswer: yes"
