This means that the meeting could potentially happen at 2 PM, or it could potentially be cancelled. \n\nFrom this information, we can infer that the meeting \"might be cancelled.\" The statement does not definitively state that the meeting will be cancelled, but rather that it \"might be cancelled,\" which is one of the two possibilities presented.\n\nAnswer: yes"
