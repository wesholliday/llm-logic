This statement does not provide any information about the likelihood or probability of the flight being on time.\n\nTo infer that \"The flight might be on time\" from the given statement, we would need to know that the flight being on time is one of the possible outcomes. Since the given statement explicitly mentions that the flight might be delayed or on time, we can infer that the flight might be on time.\n\nAnswer: yes"
