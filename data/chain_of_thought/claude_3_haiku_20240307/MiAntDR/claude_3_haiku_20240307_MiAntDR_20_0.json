This statement does not provide any information about the likelihood of the event being semi-formal specifically.\n\nTo infer that \"The event might be semi-formal\" from the given statement, we would need to know that the event is definitely not formal. However, the original statement does not rule out the possibility of the event being formal. Therefore, we cannot infer that the event might be semi-formal based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
