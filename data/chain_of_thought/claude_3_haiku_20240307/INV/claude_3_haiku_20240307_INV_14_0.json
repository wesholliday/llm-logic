It can be represented as:\nP \u2192 Q\nwhere P is 'the bear was in the cave' and Q is 'the wolf was in the den'.\n\nTo infer 'If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den', we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is the statement:\nNot Q \u2192 Not P\n\nIn other words, if the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
