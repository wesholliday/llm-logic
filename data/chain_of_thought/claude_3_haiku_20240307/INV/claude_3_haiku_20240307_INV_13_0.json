            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue' from the given statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe given statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' is a conditional statement. It can be represented as:\n\nIf P, then Q\n\nWhere P is 'the car was red' and Q is 'the truck was blue'.\n\nTo infer the statement 'If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue', we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be:\n\nIf the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\n\nThis statement is logically equivalent to the statement 'If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue' from the given statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
