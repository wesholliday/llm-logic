This would result in the statement \"If not P, then not Q\".\n\nNegating the antecedent (P) gives us \"The book was not written by James\".\nNegating the consequent (Q) gives us \"The book is not a mystery novel\".\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement would be:\n\"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
