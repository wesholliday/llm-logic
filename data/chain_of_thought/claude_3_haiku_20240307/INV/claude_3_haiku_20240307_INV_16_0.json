            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim' from the given statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe given statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim' is a conditional statement. It can be represented as:\n\nIf P, then Q\n\nWhere P represents 'the shirt was cotton' and Q represents 'the pants were denim'.\n\nTo infer the statement 'If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim', we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be:\n\nIf the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\n\nThis statement is logically equivalent to the statement 'If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim' from the given statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
