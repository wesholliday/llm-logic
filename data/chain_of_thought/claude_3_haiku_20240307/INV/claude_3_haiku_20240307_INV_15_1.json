Specifically, it states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer the inverse of this statement, which is 'If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train'.\n\nThe inverse of a conditional statement is not always true, even if the original statement is true.
