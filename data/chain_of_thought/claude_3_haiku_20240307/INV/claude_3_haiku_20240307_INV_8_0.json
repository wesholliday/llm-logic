The contrapositive is the statement:\n\nIf not Q, then not P\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be:\n\nIf the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\n\nThis statement is logically equivalent to the original statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
