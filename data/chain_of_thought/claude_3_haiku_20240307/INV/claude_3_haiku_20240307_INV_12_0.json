It can be represented as:\nIf P, then Q\nwhere P is 'Joe went to the park' and Q is 'Lucy went to the zoo'.\n\nTo infer 'If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo', we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is the statement 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be:\nIf Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\n\nThis statement is logically equivalent to the original statement 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
