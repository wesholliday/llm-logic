It can be expressed in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'Mary was at the wedding' and Q is 'Sue was at the wedding'.\n\nTo infer 'If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding', we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
