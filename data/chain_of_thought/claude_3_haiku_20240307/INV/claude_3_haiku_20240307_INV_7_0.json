It can be expressed in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'Alex finished the race' and Q is 'Chris finished the face'.\n\nTo infer the statement 'If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race', we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the antecedent and the consequent, resulting in 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be 'If Chris didn't finish the race, then Alex didn't finish the race'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
