            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball' from the given statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe given statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' is a conditional statement. It can be represented as:\n\nIf P, then Q\n\nWhere P is 'Tom watched football' and Q is 'Jen watched basketball'.\n\nTo infer the statement 'If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball', we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be:\n\nIf Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\n\nThis statement is logically equivalent to the original statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
