The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'P \u2192 Q' is '\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP', where '\u00ac' represents the negation of the statement.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be:\n'If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.'\n\nThis statement is logically equivalent to the original statement 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
