            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake' from the given statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake', we need to use the principles of logical reasoning.\n\nThe given statement, 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake', is a conditional statement. It states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This means that whenever the vampire was awake, the mummy was also awake.\n\nNow, to determine if we can infer the statement 'If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake', we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is a logically equivalent statement that can be derived by negating both the antecedent and the consequent.\n\nThe contrapositive of 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake'.\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer that 'If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake'.\n\nAnswer: yes"
