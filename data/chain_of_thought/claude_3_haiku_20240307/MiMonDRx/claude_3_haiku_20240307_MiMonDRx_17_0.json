The original statement only suggests that the zazzle might be flim frazzle, but it does not indicate that the zazzle could also be quank snizzle. Without any additional context or information, we cannot logically conclude that the zazzle might be quank snizzle based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
