In the given statement, the second part is connected to the first part using \"and it must\", whereas in the inferred statement, the second part is directly connected to the first part using \"and\".\n\nSince the given statement already states that the gribble must be flim on snork and it must blimple quazzle flim, we can infer that the gribble must be flim on snork and blimple quazzle flim.\n\nAnswer: yes"
