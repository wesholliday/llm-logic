            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The quorple must be at snork gribble and it must be in the wibble plonk\" contains two parts connected by the conjunction \"and\". The first part states that \"the quorple must be at snork gribble\", and the second part states that \"the quorple must be in the wibble plonk\".\n\nSince the two parts are connected by \"and\", we can infer that the quorple must satisfy both conditions, meaning it must be at snork gribble and it must be in the wibble plonk. Therefore, the statement \"The quorple must be at snork gribble and in the wibble plonk\" can be inferred from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
