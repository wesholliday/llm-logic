The original statement uses the conjunction \"and it must be\" to connect the two parts of the sentence, whereas the proposed inference uses the conjunction \"and\" to connect the two parts. Without more context, we cannot determine if the two parts of the original statement are meant to be independent or if they are meant to be connected. Therefore, we cannot confidently infer the proposed statement from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
