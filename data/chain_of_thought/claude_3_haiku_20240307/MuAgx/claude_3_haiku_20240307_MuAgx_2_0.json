The gronk must zazzle a plimp flim\n\nThe question asks whether we can infer the statement \"The gronk must be on the flonk and zazzle a plimp flim\" from the given statement.\n\nThe key difference between the two statements is the use of the word \"it\" in the given statement. In the given statement, the word \"it\" refers to the gronk, implying that the gronk must zazzle a plimp flim. \n\nSince the question asks whether we can infer the second statement from the first, and the only difference is the use of the word \"it\", we can conclude that the second statement can be inferred from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
