The original statement indicates that the wumble must be gronk for a flibbit, and it must also be zooble, but it does not explicitly state that the wumble must be gronk for both a flibbit and a zooble. The two statements are not logically equivalent, as the original statement allows for the possibility that the wumble could be gronk for a flibbit and a different property for a zooble.\n\nAnswer: no"
