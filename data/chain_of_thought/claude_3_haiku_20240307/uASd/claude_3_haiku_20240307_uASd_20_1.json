The original statement is that \"if I take medication, I will feel better.\" This implies that the medication is unexpired and effective.\n\n2. Expired medication may have lost its potency or efficacy, or it may even become unsafe to use. The chemical composition and properties of the medication can change over time, rendering it less effective or potentially harmful.\n\n3. Therefore, we cannot infer that if you take expired medication, you will feel better. In fact, it is more likely that you will not feel better, or you may even experience negative side effects.\n\nAnswer: No"
