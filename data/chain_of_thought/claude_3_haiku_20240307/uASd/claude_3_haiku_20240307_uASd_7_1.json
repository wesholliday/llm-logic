If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, can we infer that the kitchen is warm?\n\nThe key here is to recognize that the second premise is more specific than the first. The first premise tells us that whenever the oven is on, the kitchen is warm. The second premise adds an additional condition (the pilot light is out) to the first premise.\n\nIn logic, the more specific premise does not necessarily imply the more general premise. Just because the oven is on and the pilot light is out, it does not automatically mean that the kitchen is warm. There could be other factors that affect the temperature of the kitchen, such as ventilation, insulation, or the size of the kitchen.\n\nTherefore, we cannot confidently infer that if the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm.\n\nAnswer: no"
