When a match is soaked in water, it becomes damp or wet, which can prevent it from igniting and lighting up, even if it is struck.\n\nTherefore, the additional condition of the match being soaked in water means that the original statement is no longer a sufficient condition for the match to light.

This additional information introduces a new factor that may affect the ability of the match to light.\n\nWhen a match is soaked in water, the water can interfere with the chemical reactions necessary for the match to ignite and maintain a flame. The water can make the match's surface wet, preventing the friction from generating enough heat to ignite the match head.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that if the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will light. The additional condition of the match being soaked in water can override the original statement, and the match may not light even if it is struck.\n\nAnswer: no"

This new information changes the situation, as water can affect the ability of the match to light.\n\nWhen a match is soaked in water, the chemical composition of the match head is altered, and it becomes more difficult or even impossible for the match to light when struck.
