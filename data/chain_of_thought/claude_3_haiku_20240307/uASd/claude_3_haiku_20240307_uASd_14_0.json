However, this new information is not directly related to the original conditional statement. The original statement does not mention anything about the language of the test.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if you study hard and the test is in Chinese, you will pass the test. The language of the test is a separate factor that is not accounted for in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
