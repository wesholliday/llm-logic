The initial statement is \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired.\"\n2. The question is asking whether we can infer that \"if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired.\"\n\nThe key difference between the two statements is the addition of \"and do hard labor\" in the second statement.\n\nDoing hard labor, even after getting enough sleep, can still lead to tiredness. The physical exertion and energy expenditure involved in hard labor can cause fatigue and tiredness, regardless of the amount of sleep a person gets.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired.

The energy used up during hard labor can lead to tiredness, even if the person had enough sleep.\n\nTherefore, the second statement cannot be inferred from the first statement. Getting enough sleep may not be sufficient to avoid tiredness if the person is also doing hard labor.\n\nAnswer: no"
