The first statement tells us that if the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm.\n2. The second statement adds the condition that the pilot light is out, but it does not change the fact that the oven is on.\n3. Therefore, even if the pilot light is out, the oven is still on, and the kitchen will still be warm.\n\nAnswer: yes"
