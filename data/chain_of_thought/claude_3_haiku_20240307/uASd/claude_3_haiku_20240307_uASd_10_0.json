It simply states that if the order is placed, the item will ship.\n\nNow, the question is asking whether we can infer that if the order is placed and the item is out of stock, then it will ship.\n\nThis would not be a valid inference because the original statement does not cover the scenario where the item is out of stock. The fact that the item will ship if the order is placed does not necessarily mean that it will ship even if the item is out of stock.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the order is placed and the item is out of stock, then it will ship.\n\nAnswer: no"
