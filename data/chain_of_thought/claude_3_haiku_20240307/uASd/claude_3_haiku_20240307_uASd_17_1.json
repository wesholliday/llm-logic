This suggests that changing the oil is a sufficient condition for the car to run smoothly, but it does not necessarily mean that it is the only condition for the car to run smoothly.\n\nNow, the question asks whether we can infer that if you change the oil and the transmission is shot, the car will still run smoothly.

The question is asking whether we can infer that the car will still run smoothly if both conditions (changing the oil and the transmission being shot) are met.\n\nHowever, the fact that the transmission is shot is a separate issue from the condition of the oil.
