The original statement only tells us that if the car is in the garage, then it is safe. It does not provide any information about what happens if the garage is flooding.\n\n2. The proposed inference adds an additional condition, which is that the garage is flooding. This new condition is not addressed in the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the car is in the garage and the garage is flooding, then it is safe. The original statement does not provide enough information to support this conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
