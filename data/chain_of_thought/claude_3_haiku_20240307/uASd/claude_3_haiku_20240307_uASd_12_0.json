It simply states that if you finish your homework, you can play video games. The computer catching on fire is a separate event that is not directly related to the ability to play video games.\n\nTherefore, the additional condition of the computer catching on fire does not change the original implication that if you finish your homework, you can play video games.\n\nAnswer: yes"
