            "content": "To determine if we can infer that if the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A, we need to consider the following:\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A.\"\n\nThis statement is a conditional statement, which means that it has the form \"If A, then B,\" where A is the condition and B is the conclusion.\n\nThe new statement is: \"If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A.\"\n\nThis new statement is also a conditional statement, but it has an additional condition (the essay is turned in late) compared to the original statement.\n\nIn order to infer that the new statement is true, we would need to know that the additional condition (the essay is turned in late) does not affect the original conclusion (the student will get an A).\n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide any information about the effect of turning in the essay late on the student's grade. Therefore, we cannot infer that the new statement is true.\n\nAnswer: no"
