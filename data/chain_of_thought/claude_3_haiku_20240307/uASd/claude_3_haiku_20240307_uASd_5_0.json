This means that even though the bill was paid, the payment was not successful due to the bounced check.\n\nSince the original statement does not mention anything about the check bouncing, we cannot infer that the services will continue in that case. The original statement only guarantees that the services will continue if the bill is paid, not if the payment is successful.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the bill is paid and the check bounces, then the services will continue.\n\nAnswer: no"
