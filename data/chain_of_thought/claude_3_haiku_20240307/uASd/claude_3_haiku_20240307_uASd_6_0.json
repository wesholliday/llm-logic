This implies that when you scream, it causes a negative effect on the person's ears (in this case, it hurts them).\n3. The question then asks if we can infer that \"if you scream and I am wearing earplugs, it will hurt my ears.\"\n4. Wearing earplugs would protect the person's ears from the sound of the screaming.\n5. Therefore, if the person is wearing earplugs, the screaming would not hurt their ears.\n\nAnswer: no"
