Doing hard labor can be physically and mentally exhausting, which can lead to tiredness regardless of how much sleep one gets.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired. The additional factor of hard labor can still result in tiredness, even if you get enough sleep.\n\nAnswer: no"
