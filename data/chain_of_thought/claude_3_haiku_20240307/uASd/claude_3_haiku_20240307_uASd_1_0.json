Soaking the match in water would likely prevent it from lighting, even if it is struck.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that \"if the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will light\" is not valid. The presence of the water would override the necessary condition of striking the match.\n\nAnswer: no"
