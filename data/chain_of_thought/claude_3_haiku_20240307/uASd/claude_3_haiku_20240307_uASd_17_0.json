The original statement is \"If I change the oil, the car will run smoothly.\" This means that changing the oil is a sufficient condition for the car to run smoothly.\n\n2. The new statement adds the condition that the transmission is shot. This means that even if the oil is changed, the car may not run smoothly if the transmission is in poor condition.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if you change the oil and the transmission is shot, the car will run smoothly. The transmission issue could still prevent the car from running smoothly, even if the oil is changed.\n\nAnswer: no"
