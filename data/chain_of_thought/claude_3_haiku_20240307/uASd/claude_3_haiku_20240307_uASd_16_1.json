However, in the event of a drought, the lack of water can limit the grass's ability to utilize those nutrients effectively, even if the lawn is fertilized.\n\nDuring a drought, the grass may not have enough moisture to support the growth and maintenance of a lush, green appearance, despite the presence of fertilizer. The lack of water can lead to the grass becoming stressed, wilted, or even dormant, even if it has been fertilized.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the lawn will be lush and green if it is fertilized and there is a drought. The drought can counteract the positive effects of fertilization on the lawn's appearance.\n\nAnswer: No"

However, the presence of a drought can significantly impact the lawn's ability to utilize those nutrients effectively.\n\nDuring a drought, the lack of sufficient moisture in the soil can prevent the grass from properly absorbing and utilizing the nutrients provided by the fertilizer. The grass may not be able to grow and thrive as it would under normal watering conditions.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that if you fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green. The drought conditions can negate the potential benefits of fertilizing the lawn.\n\nAnswer: No."

This statement is a general claim about the relationship between fertilization and lawn condition, assuming normal environmental conditions.\n\nHowever, the proposed inference introduces an additional factor, a drought. During a drought, the availability of water is limited, which can have a significant impact on the lawn's growth and appearance, regardless of fertilization.\n\nFertilizing the lawn may promote growth and greenness under normal environmental conditions, but during a drought, the lack of water can prevent the lawn from responding effectively to the fertilizer. The lawn may not become lush and green, even with fertilization, due to the stress caused by the drought.\n\nTherefore, the given inference is not valid.

This indicates that fertilizing the lawn can lead to a lush and green lawn, all other factors being equal.\n\nHowever, the second premise introduces the additional condition of a drought. During a drought, the availability of water for the lawn is reduced, which can impact the growth and condition of the lawn, even if it has been fertilized.\n\nFertilizing the lawn does not guarantee that it will remain lush and green during a drought, as the lack of water can override the beneficial effects of the fertilizer. The drought can limit the lawn's ability to utilize the nutrients provided by the fertilizer, leading to a less than optimal growth and appearance.\n\nTherefore, the given inference is not valid. The fact that fertilizing the lawn will make it lush and green does not necessarily mean that it will remain lush and green in the presence of a drought.\n\nAnswer: no"

This is a reasonable inference, as fertilizers provide nutrients that can promote healthy grass growth and a vibrant appearance.\n\nHowever, the question asks if we can infer that the lawn will be lush and green if it is both fertilized and there is a drought. This is a different scenario that requires further analysis.\n\nDuring a drought, the lack of sufficient water can have a significant impact on the lawn's health and appearance, even if it has been fertilized. Grass and other plants require adequate moisture to thrive and utilize the nutrients provided by the fertilizer. Without enough water, the lawn may not be able to fully benefit from the fertilizer, and it could still appear stressed or unhealthy despite the fertilization.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot confidently infer that the lawn will be lush and green if it is both fertilized and experiencing a drought.\n\nAnswer: no"

During a drought, the availability of water is limited, which can have a significant impact on the lawn's ability to maintain its lushness and greenness, even if it has been fertilized.\n\nFertilizer alone cannot overcome the effects of a severe drought. The lawn may initially respond well to the fertilizer, but without sufficient water, the grass will eventually start to wilt, dry out, and lose its lush, green appearance.\n\nTherefore, the inference that if the lawn is fertilized and there is a drought, it will still be lush and green, is not valid.
