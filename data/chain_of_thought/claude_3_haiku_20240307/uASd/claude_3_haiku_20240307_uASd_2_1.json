The original statement is \"If we go to the concert, then we'll have a good time.\"\n2. This statement establishes a conditional relationship between going to the concert and having a good time.\n3. The question is asking whether we can infer that if we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time.\n4. However, the occurrence of a bomb going off is an additional factor that is not present in the original statement.\n5.
