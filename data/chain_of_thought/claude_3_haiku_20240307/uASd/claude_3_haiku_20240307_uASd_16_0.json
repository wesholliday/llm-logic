This implies that fertilizing the lawn is a sufficient condition for the lawn to be lush and green.\n\nHowever, the additional condition of a drought introduces a new factor that may affect the outcome. Drought can have a significant impact on the lawn's ability to thrive, even if it is fertilized.\n\nDuring a drought, the lawn may not receive enough water to support the growth and maintenance of a lush, green appearance, even if it is fertilized. The lack of water can counteract the benefits of the fertilizer.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if you fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green. The drought condition introduces an additional factor that may prevent the lawn from being lush and green, even if it is fertilized.\n\nAnswer: no"
