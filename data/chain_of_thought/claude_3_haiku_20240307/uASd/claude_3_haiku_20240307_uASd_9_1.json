The statement does not mention anything about the timing of the essay submission.\n\nHowever, in the proposed inference, an additional condition of \"turned in late\" has been added. This means that the student would get an A only if the essay is both well-written and turned in late.\n\nThe problem with this inference is that the original statement does not provide any information about the relationship between the essay being well-written and it being turned in late. The original statement does not guarantee that a well-written essay will still earn an A if it is turned in late.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that if the essay is well-written and turned in late, the student will get an A.\n\nAnswer: no"

It only states that a well-written essay will result in an A.\n6) Therefore, we cannot infer that a well-written essay turned in late will also result in an A, as the original premise does not address that scenario.\n\nAnswer: no"
