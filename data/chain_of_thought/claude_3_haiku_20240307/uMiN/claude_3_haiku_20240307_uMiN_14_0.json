The question states that \"The milk might not be on the counter.\" This means that it is possible that the milk is not on the counter.\n2. The question then asks if we can infer that \"it's not the case that the milk must be on the counter.\"\n3. If the milk might not be on the counter, then it cannot be the case that the milk must be on the counter. The possibility of the milk not being on the counter contradicts the idea that it must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes"
