The newspaper must be in the driveway.\n\nThe statement \"The newspaper might not be in the driveway\" is a possibility or a negation of the idea that the newspaper is in the driveway. It suggests that the newspaper may or may not be in the driveway.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"The newspaper must be in the driveway\" is a stronger claim, indicating that the newspaper is necessarily in the driveway.\n\nIf the first statement is true (the newspaper might not be in the driveway), then the second statement (the newspaper must be in the driveway) cannot be true. This is because the first statement contradicts the necessary condition implied in the second statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the newspaper might not be in the driveway, then it is not the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes"
