It only suggests that it's possible the alien did not visit Mars.\n3) The negation of \"the alien must have visited Mars\" is \"it's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars.\"\n4) Since the original statement does not imply that the alien must have visited Mars, we can infer that it's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes"
