It only suggests that it is possible the book was not written by James.\n3) The question is asking whether we can infer that \"it's not the case that the book must have been written by James.\"\n4) If the book \"might not have been written by James,\" then it is not the case that the book \"must have been written by James.\"\n5) Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
