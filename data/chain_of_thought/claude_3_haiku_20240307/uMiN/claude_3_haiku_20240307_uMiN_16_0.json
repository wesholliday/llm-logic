This does not necessarily mean that the pen is not in the bag, it just means that we cannot be certain that it is in the bag.\n\nThe statement \"Can we infer that it's not the case that the pen must be in my bag?\" is asking whether we can conclude that the pen is not required to be in the bag, based on the information that the pen might not be in the bag.\n\nIf the pen might not be in the bag, then it is not the case that the pen must be in the bag. The possibility that the pen is not in the bag means that it is not a requirement for the pen to be in the bag.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
