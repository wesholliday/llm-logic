The phrase \"might not\" suggests a possibility, but it does not imply a definitive conclusion.\n\nIf the shoes might not be in the closet, it means that there is a possibility that they are not in the closet. However, this does not automatically mean that they must not be in the closet. It is still possible that the shoes are in the closet, even though there is a possibility that they are not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that it is not the case that the shoes must be in the closet based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
