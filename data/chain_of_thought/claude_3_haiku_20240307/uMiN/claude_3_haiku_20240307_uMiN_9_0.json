This means that there is a scenario where Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nNow, the question is asking whether we can infer that it's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n\nIf Lisa must have bought the red shirt, then there would be no scenario where she did not buy it. However, the initial statement suggests that there is a scenario where she did not buy it.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that it's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
