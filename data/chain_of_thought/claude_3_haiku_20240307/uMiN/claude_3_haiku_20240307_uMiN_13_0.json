It only means that it is possible that the toy is not in the toy box.\n3) The statement \"it's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the toy is in the toy box.\n4) Since the original statement \"The toy might not be in the toy box\" is compatible with the statement \"it's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\", we can infer that the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes"
