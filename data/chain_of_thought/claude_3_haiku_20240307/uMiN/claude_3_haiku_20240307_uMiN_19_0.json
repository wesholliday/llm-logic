It only suggests that it's possible the watch is not charging on the dresser.\n3) The negation of \"the watch must be charging on the dresser\" is \"it's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\"\n4) Since the original statement does not imply that the watch must be charging on the dresser, we can infer that it's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes"
