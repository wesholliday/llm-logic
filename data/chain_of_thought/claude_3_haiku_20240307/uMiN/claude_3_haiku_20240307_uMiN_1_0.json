This does not necessarily mean that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nIf Mary might not have been at the wedding, then it is not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding. The possibility that Mary was not present implies that it is not a certainty that she was present.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that it is not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes"
