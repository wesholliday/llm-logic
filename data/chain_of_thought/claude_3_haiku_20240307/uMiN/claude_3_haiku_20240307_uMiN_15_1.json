It suggests that it's possible the shoes are not in the closet, but it does not necessarily imply that they are not in the closet.\n\nThe second statement, \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet,\" is a stronger statement. It means that it is not true that the shoes are definitely in the closet. In other words, the shoes are not necessarily in the closet.\n\nSince the second statement is a stronger statement that implies the first statement, we can infer that the second statement is true if the first statement is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
