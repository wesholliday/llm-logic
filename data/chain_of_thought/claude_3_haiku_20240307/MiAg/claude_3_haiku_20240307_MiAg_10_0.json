This means that both of these statements are true independently, but it does not necessarily mean that they are true together.\n\nThe statement 'The concert might be cancelled and rescheduled' implies that the concert might be both cancelled and rescheduled, which is a stronger claim than the given statement. The given statement only tells us that the concert might be cancelled and the concert might be rescheduled, but it does not explicitly state that the concert might be both cancelled and rescheduled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The concert might be cancelled and rescheduled' from the given statement 'The concert might be cancelled and the concert might be rescheduled'.\n\nAnswer: no"
