            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The wibble must be zizz\" does not provide enough information to infer \"The wibble must be wobble or zizz\". The statement only tells us that the wibble must be zizz, but it does not give any information about whether the wibble could also be wobble. Without additional context or information, we cannot logically conclude that the wibble must be either wobble or zizz. The original statement is too specific to allow for that broader inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
