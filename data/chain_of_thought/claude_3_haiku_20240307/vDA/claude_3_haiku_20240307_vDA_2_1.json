            "content": "Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:\n\n1. The first premise is \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\". This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the griffin was in the forest) is true, then the consequent (the unicorn was in the forest) must also be true.\n\n2. The second premise is \"The griffin was not in the forest\". This is the negation of the antecedent in the first premise.\n\n3. The conclusion is \"The unicorn was not in the forest\". This is the negation of the consequent in the first premise.\n\nBased on this, the form of the argument is:\nIf P, then Q\nNot P\nTherefore, Not Q\n\nThis is a valid form of argument, known as modus tollens.

The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest. This does not necessarily imply that if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was also not in the forest.\n\n2. The second premise states that the griffin was not in the forest.
