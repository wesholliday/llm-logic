            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\nPremise 2: The alien did not visit Mars.\nConclusion: The robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity of this argument, we can use the rules of propositional logic.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the alien visited Mars\" and Q is \"the robot visited Jupiter\".\n\nThe second premise is the negation of the antecedent (P) in the first premise, which is \"not P\".\n\nThe conclusion is the negation of the consequent (Q) in the first premise, which is \"not Q\".\n\nThis form of argument is known as the \"modus tollens\" rule of inference, which is a valid form of argument. The modus tollens rule states that if the antecedent is false, then the consequent must also be false.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
