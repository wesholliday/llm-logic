            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe argument has the following structure:\nPremise 1: If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\nPremise 2: The bear was not in the cave.\nConclusion: The wolf was not in the den.\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity of this argument, we can use the rules of propositional logic.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q is \"the wolf was in the den\".\n\nThe second premise is the negation of the antecedent (P) of the conditional statement in the first premise.\n\nThe conclusion is the negation of the consequent (Q) of the conditional statement in the first premise.\n\nThis form of argument is known as the \"modus tollens\" rule of inference, which is a valid form of argument. The modus tollens rule states that if the antecedent is false, then the consequent must also be false.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
