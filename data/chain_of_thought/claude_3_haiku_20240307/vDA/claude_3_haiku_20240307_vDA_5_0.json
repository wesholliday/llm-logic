            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical form of the argument.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nThe second premise is the negation of the antecedent of the conditional statement: \"Jeff did not play basketball.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acP.\"\n\nThe conclusion is the negation of the consequent of the conditional statement: \"Amy did not play tennis.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acQ.\"\n\nThe logical form of the argument is:\nPremise 1: P \u2192 Q\nPremise 2: \u00acP\nConclusion: \u00acQ\n\nThis logical form is known as the \"modus tollens\" form of argument, which is a valid form of argument. In modus tollens, if the antecedent is false, then the consequent must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
