            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\nPremise 2: The vampire was not awake.\nConclusion: The mummy was not awake.\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we can use the rules of propositional logic.\n\nThe first premise, \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake. In other words, the mummy's state of being awake is dependent on the vampire's state of being awake.\n\nThe second premise, \"The vampire was not awake,\" is the negation of the antecedent in the first premise.\n\nThe conclusion, \"The mummy was not awake,\" is the negation of the consequent in the first premise.\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. In modus tollens, if the antecedent is false, then the consequent must also be false.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
