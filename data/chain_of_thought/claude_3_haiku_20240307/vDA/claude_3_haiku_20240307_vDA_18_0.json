            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\nPremise 2: The doll was not plastic.\nConclusion: The truck was not metal.\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity of this argument, we can use the rules of propositional logic.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal\".\n\nThe second premise is the negation of the antecedent of the conditional statement, which can be represented as \"not P\".\n\nThe conclusion is the negation of the consequent of the conditional statement, which can be represented as \"not Q\".\n\nThe logical form of the argument is:\nP \u2192 Q\nnot P\nTherefore, not Q\n\nThis form of argument is known as the \"modus tollens\" rule of inference, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic.\n\nAnswer: yes"
