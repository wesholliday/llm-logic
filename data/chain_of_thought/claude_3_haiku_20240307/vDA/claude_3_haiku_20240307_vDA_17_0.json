            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical form of the argument.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q,\" where P represents \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q represents \"Kate ate salad.\"\n\nThe second premise is the negation of the antecedent of the conditional statement: \"Ben did not eat pasta.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acP.\"\n\nThe conclusion is the negation of the consequent of the conditional statement: \"Kate did not eat salad.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acQ.\"\n\nThe logical form of the argument can be expressed as:\nPremise 1: P \u2192 Q\nPremise 2: \u00acP\nConclusion: \u00acQ\n\nThis logical form is known as the \"modus tollens\" form of argument, which is a valid form of logical inference. In modus tollens, if the antecedent is false, then the consequent must also be false.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
