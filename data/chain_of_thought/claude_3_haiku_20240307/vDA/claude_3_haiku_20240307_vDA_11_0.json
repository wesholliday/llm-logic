            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe argument has the following structure:\nPremise 1: If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\nPremise 2: The cake was not chocolate.\nConclusion: The muffins were not blueberry.\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity of this argument, we can use the rules of propositional logic and the concept of logical implication.\n\nThe first premise, \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry,\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the antecedent (the cake was chocolate) is true, then the consequent (the muffins were blueberry) must also be true.\n\nThe second premise, \"The cake was not chocolate,\" is the negation of the antecedent in the first premise.\n\nThe conclusion, \"The muffins were not blueberry,\" is the negation of the consequent in the first premise.\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of logical inference. In modus tollens, if the antecedent is false, then the consequent must also be false.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
