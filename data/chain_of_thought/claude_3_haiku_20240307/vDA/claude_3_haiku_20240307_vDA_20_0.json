            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical form of the argument.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be represented as \"A \u2192 B\", where A represents \"the apple was red\" and B represents \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\nThe second premise is the negation of the antecedent of the conditional statement: \"The apple was not red.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acA.\"\n\nThe conclusion is the negation of the consequent of the conditional statement: \"The banana was not yellow.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acB.\"\n\nThe logical form of the argument can be expressed as:\nPremise 1: A \u2192 B\nPremise 2: \u00acA\nConclusion: \u00acB\n\nThis logical form is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument. In Modus Tollens, if the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, then the consequent must also be false.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
