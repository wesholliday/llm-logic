            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument and check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThe argument has the following form:\nPremise 1: If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\nPremise 2: Joe did not go to the park.\nConclusion: Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we can use the rules of propositional logic.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo\".\n\nThe second premise is the negation of the antecedent (P) of the conditional statement in the first premise.\n\nThe conclusion is the negation of the consequent (Q) of the conditional statement in the first premise.\n\nThis form of argument is known as the \"Modus Tollens\" rule of inference, which states that if the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, then the consequent must also be false.\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid, as the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
