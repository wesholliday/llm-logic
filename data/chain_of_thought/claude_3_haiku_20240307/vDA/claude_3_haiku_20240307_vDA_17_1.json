The first premise is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\", where P represents \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q represents \"Kate ate salad\".\n\n2. The second premise negates the antecedent of the conditional statement, i.e., \"Ben did not eat pasta\".\n\n3. In classical logic, the valid inference rule for this type of argument is called \"Modus Tollens\". It states that if the antecedent is false (Ben did not eat pasta), then the consequent must also be false (Kate did not eat salad).\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid, as the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes"
