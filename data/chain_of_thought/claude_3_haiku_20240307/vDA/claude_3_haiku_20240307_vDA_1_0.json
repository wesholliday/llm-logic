            "content": "To determine if the given argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical form of the argument.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe second premise is the negation of the antecedent of the conditional statement: \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" This can be represented as \"not P.\"\n\nThe conclusion is the negation of the consequent of the conditional statement: \"Sue was not at the wedding.\" This can be represented as \"not Q.\"\n\nThe logical form of the argument is:\nPremise 1: If P, then Q\nPremise 2: not P\nConclusion: not Q\n\nThis logical form is known as the modus tollens form of argument, which is a valid form of argument. In modus tollens, if the antecedent is false (not P), then the consequent must also be false (not Q).\n\nTherefore, the given argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
