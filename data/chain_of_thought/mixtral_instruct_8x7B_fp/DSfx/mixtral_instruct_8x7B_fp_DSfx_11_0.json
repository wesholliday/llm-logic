            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'Either the flug is zimmed or it is blummed' is a disjunction, meaning that it presents two possible scenarios: either the flug is zimmed, or it is blummed. When we learn that 'The flug is not zimmed', we can infer that the first scenario does not hold true. In logic, when the negation of a disjunct is false, the remaining disjunct must be true. Therefore, since the flug is not zimmed, it must be blummed.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
