The statement \"Either the wug is bimmed or it is flooped\" presents two possible scenarios for the wug - it is either bimmed or flooped. The second statement \"The wug is not bimmed\" negates the first possibility, leaving us with only one option. Therefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that \"The wug is flooped\".\n\nAnswer: Yes"
