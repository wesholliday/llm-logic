            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'Either the wug is garbled or it is sproinged' is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two component statements must be true. If we know that 'The wug is not garbled' is true, then it follows that the other disjunct 'it is sproinged' must be true. This is an application of the principle of logical contradiction, which states that two contradictory statements cannot both be true. Therefore, we can indeed infer that 'The wug is sproinged' is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
