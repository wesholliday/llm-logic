This is a statement that presents two mutually exclusive options - the shank cannot be both nugged and plooked at the same time. Second, we are told that the shank is not nugged.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can indeed infer that the shank is plooked. This is because the first statement presents the only two possibilities for the shank's state, and the second statement eliminates one of those possibilities, leaving us with only one option remaining.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
