The component statements are \"the dreb is spended\" and \"the dreb is vroombed\". \n\nWe are also given the statement \"The dreb is not spened\", which is a negation of the first component statement. \n\nSince at least one of the component statements must be true, and we know that the first statement is not true, it must be the case that the second statement is true. \n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The dreb is vroombed\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
