The word 'or' indicates that at least one of these conditions must be true.\n\nIn the second statement, 'The twonk is not plinked', we are told that the second condition (the twonk being plinked) is false.\n\nSince 'or' is exclusive here, meaning only one condition needs to be true, and we know that the second condition is false, it follows that the first condition (the twonk being varnished) must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
