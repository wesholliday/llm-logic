However, the second statement 'The zinger is not smoogled' negates one of the options in the disjunction. Since we know that the zinger is not smoogled, and that's one of the two possibilities, we are left with the other possibility: 'it is fraggled'. Therefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer 'The zinger is fraggled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
