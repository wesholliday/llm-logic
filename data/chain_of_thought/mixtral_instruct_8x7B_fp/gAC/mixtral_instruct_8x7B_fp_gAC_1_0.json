The second statement given is 'Sue was at the wedding' which is in the form of 'q'. To determine if 'Mary was at the wedding' is true, we need to use Modus Ponens, a rule of inference in logic that allows us to infer 'q' from 'if p then q' and 'p'. However, in this case, we are not given 'p' (Mary was at the wedding), only 'q' (Sue was at the wedding). Therefore, we cannot conclude that 'Mary was at the wedding' is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No."
