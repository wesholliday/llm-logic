This means that the condition (Alex finishing the race) is sufficient for the consequence (Chris finishing the race) to occur. However, the converse is not necessarily true - Chris finishing the race does not guarantee that Alex finished the race as well. But in this case, we are given an additional piece of information - 'Chris finished the race is true'. Since the condition (Alex finishing the race) is sufficient for the consequence (Chris finishing the race), and we know that the consequence is true, it follows that the condition must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
