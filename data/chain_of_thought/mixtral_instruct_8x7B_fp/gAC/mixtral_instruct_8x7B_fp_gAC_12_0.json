            "content": "Explanation: This question is about logical reasoning and specifically the concept of conditional statements in logic. A conditional statement has the form 'If P, then Q', where P is called the antecedent and Q is called the consequent. In this case, the antecedent is 'Joe went to the park' and the consequent is 'Lucy went to the zoo'.\n\nThe truth table for 'If P, then Q' is as follows:\n\n| P   | Q   | If P, then Q |\n|---|---|------------|\n| T   | T   |     T      |\n| T   | F   |     F      |\n| F   | T   |     T      |\n| F   | F   |     T      |\n\nAs we can see, if the consequent (Q) is true, and the conditional statement (If P, then Q) is also true, then the antecedent (P) must be true.\n\nIn this case, the given information is that 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' is true and 'Lucy went to the zoo' is true. Therefore, from the truth table, it follows that 'Joe went to the park' is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
