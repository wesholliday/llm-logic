The statement 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' means that the truth of 'the cake was chocolate' (referred to as p) guarantees the truth of 'the muffins were blueberry' (referred to as q). \n\nHowever, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. Just because 'the muffins were blueberry' guarantees that 'if the muffins were blueberry, then the cake could have been chocolate', it does not guarantee that 'the cake was chocolate'. There could be other possible scenarios where the muffins are blueberry regardless of the cake's flavor.\n\nTherefore, even though we know that 'the muffins were blueberry', we cannot definitively conclude that 'the cake was chocolate'.\n\nAnswer: No."
