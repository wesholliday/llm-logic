            "content": "Explanation: This question is asking about a logical relationship known as transitive inference. The statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' is an example of a conditional statement, often written as 'If P, then Q'. The statement 'The banana was yellow' is the consequent of the first statement, so we know that Q is true. However, to determine if 'The apple was red' (P) is true, we need to consider the possibility that there are other factors that could have made the banana yellow, not just the color of the apple. Without further information, we cannot be certain that 'The apple was red' is true.\n\nAnswer: No."
