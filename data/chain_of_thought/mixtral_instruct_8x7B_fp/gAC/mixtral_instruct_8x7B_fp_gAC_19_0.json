            "content": "Explanation: This question is a application of logical reasoning, specifically using the concept of conditional statements and modus ponens. A conditional statement is a statement of the form \"If P, then Q\". Modus ponens is the rule of inference that allows us to infer \"Q\" from \"If P, then Q\" and \"P\". In this case, the given statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is the conditional statement, denoted as \"P -> Q\". The second given statement \"Jen watched basketball\" is \"Q\". To determine if \"Tom watched football\" (P), we can use modus ponens. Given \"P -> Q\" and \"Q\", we can infer \"P\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
