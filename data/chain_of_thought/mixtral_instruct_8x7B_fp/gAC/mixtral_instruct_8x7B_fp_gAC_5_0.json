            "content": "Explanation: This question is testing whether the given statements follow the rules of logical reasoning, specifically the concept of logical implication. The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is an example of a conditional statement, often denoted as \"P -> Q\", where P represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q represents \"Amy played tennis\". \n\nThe truth table for \"P -> Q\" is as follows:\n\n| P (Jeff played basketball) | Q (Amy played tennis) | P -> Q (If P, then Q) |\n|---|---|---|\n| True | True | True |\n| True | False | False |\n| False | True | True |\n| False | False | True |\n\nAs we can see from the truth table, even if P (Jeff playing basketball) is False, the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" remains true as long as Q is not false.\n\nGiven that the statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is true and \"Amy played tennis\" is true, according to the truth table, the conditional statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" could still be true even if Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the truth of \"Amy played tennis\" alone does not guarantee the truth of \"Jeff played basketball\". The only situation where both \"Jeff played basketball\" and \"Amy played tennis\" are guaranteed to be true is when the conditional statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is true and \"Jeff played basketball\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: No."
