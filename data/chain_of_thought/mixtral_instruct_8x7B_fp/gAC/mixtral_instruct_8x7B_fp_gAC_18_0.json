This is known as fallacy of affirming the consequent. \n\nIn this case, we know that the truck was metal, but we don't know if the doll was plastic or not. It could be that the doll is plastic, but it could also be that the doll is not plastic. \n\nTherefore, even though 'The truck was metal' is true, we cannot definitively say that 'The doll was plastic' is true.\n\nAnswer: No."
