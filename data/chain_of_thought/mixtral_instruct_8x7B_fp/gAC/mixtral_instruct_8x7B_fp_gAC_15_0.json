If \"Erin took a train\" is true, the statement doesn't necessarily imply that \"Sam took a plane.\" The truth of Erin's action does not depend on Sam's action according to this statement. \n\nHowever, the statement does say that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. It does not say that if Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane. \n\nAnswer: No."
