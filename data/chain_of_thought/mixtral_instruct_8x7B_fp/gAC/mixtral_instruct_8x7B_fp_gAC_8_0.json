This is often written as P -> Q, where P represents \"the vampire was awake\" and Q represents \"the mummy was awake\".\n\nGiven that this conditional statement is true, and that the statement \"The mummy was awake\" (Q) is true, we can use a logical reasoning technique called \"modus ponens\" to determine if the statement \"The vampire was awake\" (P) is true.\n\nModus ponens states that if P -> Q is true, and P is true, then Q must be true. However, in this case, we're not given that P (the vampire was awake) is true, we're only given that Q (the mummy was awake) is true.\n\nSo, we cannot directly conclude that \"The vampire was awake\" (P) is true. It's possible, but not certain, based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: No."
