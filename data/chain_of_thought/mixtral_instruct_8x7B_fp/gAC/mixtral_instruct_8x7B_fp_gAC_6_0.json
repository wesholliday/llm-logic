Given that this statement is true, it means that if the condition (Sue choosing pizza) is met, then the consequence (Bob choosing pasta) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we are given that Bob did indeed choose pasta. However, to determine if Sue chose pizza based on the given information, we need to establish if the condition causing the consequence is true.\n\nThe truth of 'Bob chose pasta' does not necessarily imply that Sue had to choose pizza. It's possible that Bob could have chosen pasta for some other reason, not related to Sue's choice.\n\nBut the statement also doesn't say that Bob's choice of pasta is the only possible consequence of Sue's choice of pizza. It only asserts that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n\nAnswer: No."
