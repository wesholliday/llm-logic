The second statement 'The fribble might not be crinked' indicates that there is a possibility that the fribble is not crinkled. \n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that the fribble is snurgled. It is possible that the fribble is neither crinkled nor snurgled. The second statement only tells us that it is possible for the fribble to not be crinkled, but it does not rule out the possibility of the fribble being snurgled or neither.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that 'The fribble is snurgled'.\n\nAnswer: No."
