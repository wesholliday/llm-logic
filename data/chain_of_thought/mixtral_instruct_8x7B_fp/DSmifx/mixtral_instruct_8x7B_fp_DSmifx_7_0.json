If 'The whiffle might not be tinked', this implies that it's possible for the whiffle not to be tinked, and thus, the first part of the disjunction 'Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked' cannot be true. Therefore, the second part of the disjunction, 'it is shanked', must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
