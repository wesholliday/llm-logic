The second statement is \"The dreb might not be spened\", which suggests that there is a possibility that the dreb is not spent.\n\nHowever, even if there is a possibility that the dreb is not spent, it does not necessarily mean that it is not vroombed. The two statements \"spended\" and \"vroombed\" seem to be unrelated, and the truth of one does not depend on the truth of the other.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The dreb is vroombed\".\n\nAnswer: No."
