If we know that \"The sneg might not be sproted,\" this means that it is possible that the sneg is not sproted. If it is possible that the sneg is not sproted, then the first statement implies that the sneg must be crampled. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The sneg is crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes."
