If the glip might not be tragged, as stated in the second sentence, then it is possible that the glip is not tragged. However, this does not necessarily mean that the glip is slogged. It is still possible that the glip is not tragged and also not slogged. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The glip is slogged\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No."
