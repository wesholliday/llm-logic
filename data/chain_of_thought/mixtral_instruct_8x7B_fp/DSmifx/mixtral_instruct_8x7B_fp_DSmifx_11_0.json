If the flug is not zimmed, as stated in \"The flug might not be zimmed\", then the second part of the disjunction \"it is blummed\" must be true, because at least one part of the disjunction must be true. Therefore, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The flug is blummed\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
