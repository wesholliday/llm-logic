However, the truth of the first statement does not necessarily mean the truth of the second statement. The second statement 'The wug might not be garbled' only tells us that there is a possibility that the wug is not garbled, but it does not rule out the possibility that the wug is garbled. Therefore, from these two statements, we cannot infer that 'The wug is sproinged'.\n\nAnswer: No."
