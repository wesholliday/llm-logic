If the shank is not nugged, as stated in 'The shank might not be nugged', then it must be the case that 'it is plooked' from our original disjunction. This is an application of logical reasoning called proof by contradiction, where we assume the opposite of what we want to prove (that the shank is not plooked), and show that it leads to a contradiction (the shank must be nugged or plooked, and we've assumed it's not nugged, so it must be plooked).\n\nAnswer: Yes"
