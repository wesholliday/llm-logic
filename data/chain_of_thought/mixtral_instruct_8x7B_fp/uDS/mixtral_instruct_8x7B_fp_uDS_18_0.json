The statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand\" is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. If the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand, as stated, then it must be in the drawer, because the only other option has been ruled out.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
