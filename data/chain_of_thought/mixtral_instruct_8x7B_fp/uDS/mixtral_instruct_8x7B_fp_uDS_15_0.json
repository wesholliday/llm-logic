In this case, the simple statements are \"the shoes are in the closet\" and \"they are lined up by the door\". The statement also tells us that the shoes are not lined up by the door.\n\nGiven that the shoes cannot be both in the closet and lined up by the door at the same time (assuming we're talking about the same pair of shoes), we can indeed infer that the shoes must be in the closet. This is because the only two possibilities are that the shoes are in the closet or they are lined up by the door, and we've been told they are not lined up by the door.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
