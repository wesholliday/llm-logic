The statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are perched on her head\" is a disjunction, meaning one part or the other must be true. However, the next statement \"the sunglasses aren't perched on her head\" negates one part of the disjunction, leaving us with only one possibility: the sunglasses being in her bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
