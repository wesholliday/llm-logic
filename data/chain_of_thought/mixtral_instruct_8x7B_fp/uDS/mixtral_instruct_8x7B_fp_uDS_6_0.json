We are told that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen.\n3. If the phone were ringing in the kitchen, it would contradict the second statement, but since no contradiction exists, the phone must not be ringing in the kitchen.\n4. Since the phone is either in the living room or ringing in the kitchen, and it's not ringing in the kitchen, it must be in the living room.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
