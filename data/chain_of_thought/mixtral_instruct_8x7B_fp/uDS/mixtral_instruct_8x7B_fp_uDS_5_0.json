A disjunction is true if at least one of its disjuncts is true. In this case, the two disjuncts are 'the cookies are in the jar' and 'they are hidden in the pantry'. \n\nWe are also given the information that 'the cookies aren't hidden in the pantry'. This negates one of our disjuncts, leaving us with only one possibility: 'the cookies are in the jar'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
