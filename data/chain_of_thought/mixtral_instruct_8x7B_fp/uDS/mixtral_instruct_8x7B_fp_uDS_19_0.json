The watch is either charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist (Dresser OR Wrist).\n2. The watch is not on his wrist (NOT Wrist).\n\nFrom statement 2, we can exclude the possibility of the watch being on his wrist. Now, we are left with only one possibility regarding the watch's location, as stated in statement 1: The watch is charging on the dresser (Dresser).\n\nAnswer: Yes."
