The negation of the second part of the statement, \"it is not resting on the table,\" leads us to conclude that the book is not in its second possible location. Since the first possibility, \"the book is on the shelf,\" has not been explicitly ruled out, we can infer that the book is indeed on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
