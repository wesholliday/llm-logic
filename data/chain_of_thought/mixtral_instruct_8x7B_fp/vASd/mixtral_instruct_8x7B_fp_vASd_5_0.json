This is not a logically valid form of argument because the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. The reason is that the conclusion introduces a new condition (R, the check bouncing) that was not present in the original premise. Even if the original condition (P, the bill being paid) is true, the new condition could be false and prevent the conclusion from being true.\n\nAnswer: No."
