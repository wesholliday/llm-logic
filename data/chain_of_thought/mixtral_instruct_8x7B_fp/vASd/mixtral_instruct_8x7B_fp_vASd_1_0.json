Therefore, if P and R then Q.\" This form is called \"Affirming the Consequent\" and it is a fallacy, meaning the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. In this case, the premise states that if the match is struck, it will light. The conclusion states that if the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, it will light. However, even if the match is struck, it will not light if it has been soaked in water, because being soaked in water prevents it from lighting. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No."
