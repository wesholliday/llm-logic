The middle term, which is 'fertilizing the lawn', is not distributed in either the premise or the conclusion. The argument assumes that fertilizing the lawn is sufficient for the lawn to be lush and green, regardless of any other factors such as drought. However, the presence of a drought would affect the outcome, making the conclusion unsound.\n\nAnswer: No."
