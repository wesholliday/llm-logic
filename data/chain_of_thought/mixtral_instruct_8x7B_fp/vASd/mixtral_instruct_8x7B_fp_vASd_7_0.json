This is not logically valid in general because it doesn't account for the situation where R is true but P is false. In this case, the premise is 'If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm', and the conclusion is 'If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm'. If the pilot light being out has no effect on whether the kitchen is warm or not when the oven is on, then the conclusion could be false even if the premise is true.\n\nAnswer: No."
