            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is not logically valid because the conclusion makes an additional assumption not present in the premise. The premise only states that changing the oil will make the car run smoothly, but the conclusion assumes that the car will still run smoothly even if the transmission is shot. This is an invalid form of argument because the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Even if the premise is true and the oil is changed, the car will not run smoothly if the transmission is shot. Therefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: No."
