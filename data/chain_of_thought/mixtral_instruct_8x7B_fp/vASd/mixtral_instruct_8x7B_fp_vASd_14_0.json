The middle term, \"pass the test,\" is not distributed in either the premise or the conclusion, meaning it does not cover all possible instances of passing the test. In the premise, passing the test is only connected to studying hard, but in the conclusion, an additional condition, the test being in Chinese, is introduced. This extra condition makes the conclusion stronger than the premise, which is a logical fallacy.\n\nAnswer: No."
