It states that if a statement of the form \"it is not the case that not-A\" is true, then the statement \"A\" is also true. In this case, the premise \"it's not the case that the vampire must have been awake\" can be rewritten as \"it is not the case that not-A\", where A is \"the vampire was awake\". Therefore, the conclusion \"the vampire might not have been awake\" or \"it is possible that not-A\" is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
