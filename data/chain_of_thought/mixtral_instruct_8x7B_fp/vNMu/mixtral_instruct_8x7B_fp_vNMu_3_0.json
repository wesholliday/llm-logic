            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called Negation Introduction or N negation, where if a statement 'A' is negated, it leads to the conclusion that the original statement might not be true. In this case, the premise 'It is not the case that the book must have been written by James' is the negation of 'The book must have been written by James'. The negated premise suggests that there is a possibility that the book was not written by James. Therefore, the conclusion 'The book might not have been written by James' is a logical consequence of the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
