In this case, the premise \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway\" can be rephrased as \"It is possible that the newspaper is not in the driveway.\" This implies that there is a possibility for the newspaper not to be in the driveway, which is the same as the conclusion \"The newspaper might not be in the driveway.\" Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
