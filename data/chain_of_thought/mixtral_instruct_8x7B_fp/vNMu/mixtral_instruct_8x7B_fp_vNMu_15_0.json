In this case, the premise 'It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet' can be rephrased as 'It's possible that the shoes are not in the closet'. Both statements convey the same idea, that the shoes are not necessarily in the closet. The conclusion 'The shoes might not be in the closet' is simply a restatement of the premise in different words. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
