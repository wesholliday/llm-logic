Logically, if it's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer (which means it's not necessary for the notebook to be in the drawer), then it is logically possible that the notebook might not be in the drawer. This is because if something is not necessarily true, then it could be possible that it is not true at all. Hence, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
