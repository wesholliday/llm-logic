            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called negation elimination or double negation elimination. It is a valid rule of inference in classical logic. If we negate a statement (in this case, 'it is not the case that the alien must have visited Mars'), we are saying that the statement is not necessarily true. This is equivalent to saying that the statement is possibly false, which is the same as saying 'the alien might not have visited Mars'. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
