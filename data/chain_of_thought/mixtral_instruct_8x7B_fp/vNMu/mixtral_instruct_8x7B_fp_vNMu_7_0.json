If it's not the case that Alex must have finished the race, then it implies that there is a possibility that Alex did not finish the race, which can be expressed as 'Alex might not have finished the race'. This is an example of the logical fallacy called \"affirming the consequent\", but it is valid in the sense that the conclusion is a logically possible outcome given the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
