If it's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag, then it means there's a possibility that they are not in her bag. The word \"might\" in the conclusion indicates a possibility, which is consistent with the information provided in the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
