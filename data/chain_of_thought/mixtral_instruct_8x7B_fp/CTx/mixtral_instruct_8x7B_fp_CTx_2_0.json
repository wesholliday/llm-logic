            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint' is a conditional statement in the form of 'if p then q'. The logical operation here is called material implication, where p is the hypothesis (wug was flooped) and q is the conclusion (wug bimmed the zoint).\n\nTo infer 'If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped', we need to form the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is created by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then swapping their places.\n\nThe contrapositive of 'If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint' is 'If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped'.\n\nSince the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer 'If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped' from 'If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
