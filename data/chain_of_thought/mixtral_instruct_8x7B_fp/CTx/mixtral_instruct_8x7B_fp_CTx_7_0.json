The original statement is:\n\nP1: If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\n\nWe want to know if we can infer the following statement:\n\nP2: If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to understand the concept of the contrapositive of a statement. The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nThe contrapositive of P1 is:\n\nP1c: If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nSince P1 and P1c are logically equivalent, if P1 is true, then P1c must also be true. Therefore, if we can assume that P1 is true, then we can infer P2.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
