            "content": "Explanation: This question is asking about the logical relationship between two statements, which is a matter of logic, not of the specific meanings of the words \"blimmed\" and \"zargled.\" The original statement is an example of a hypothetical or conditional statement, often written in the form \"if P then Q.\" The statement being asked about is a contrapositive statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"if P then Q\" is \"if not Q then not P.\"\n\nTo see why the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, consider the following:\n\n* If P is true, then Q must be true (this is the original statement).\n* If Q is not true, then P must not be true (because if P were true, then Q would have to be true, but we're assuming that Q is not true).\n\nSo the truth of the original statement implies the truth of the contrapositive, and vice versa.\n\nIn this case, the original statement is \"if the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"if the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes."
