            "content": "Explanation: This question is asking about the logical relationship between two statements, which is a concept covered in logic and philosophy. The first statement is \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\" This is a conditional statement, often represented as \"P -> Q,\" where P is \"the clug was fleeked\" and Q is \"the clug snugged.\"\n\nThe second statement is the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"P -> Q\" is \"not Q -> not P.\" In this case, \"not Q\" is \"the clug did not snug,\" and \"not P\" is \"the clug was not fleeked.\" Therefore, the second statement is \"If the clug did not snug, then the clug was not fleeked.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true, and vice versa. Therefore, we can infer \"If the clug did not snug, then the clug was not fleeked\" from \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes."
