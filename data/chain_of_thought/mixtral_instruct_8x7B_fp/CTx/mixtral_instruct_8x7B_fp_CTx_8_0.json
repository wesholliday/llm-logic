            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled' is a conditional statement in the form of 'if p then q'. This statement only tells us about the relationship between the cranking and dangling of the sprocket when the sprocket is cranked. It does not tell us anything about what happens when the sprocket is not daggled.\n\nHowever, we want to infer 'If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked'. This is the contrapositive of the original statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled'. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nBut we cannot directly infer the contrapositive from the original statement without knowing the truth values of the original statement or its contrapositive. In other words, we cannot determine if the sprocket was not cranked when it was not daggled based solely on the given statement. We would need additional information to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: No."
