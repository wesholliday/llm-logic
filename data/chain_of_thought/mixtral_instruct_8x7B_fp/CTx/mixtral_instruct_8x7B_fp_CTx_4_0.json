            "content": "Explanation: This question is asking about the logical relationship between two statements, specifically whether the first statement implies the second statement. The first statement is \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\" This can be represented as:\n\nSnurgled(fribble) -> Crinkled(fribble)\n\nThe second statement is \"If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled.\" This can be represented as:\n\nNot Crinkled(fribble) -> Not Snurgled(fribble)\n\nTo determine if the first statement implies the second statement, we need to consider whether the first statement's hypothesis (Snurgled(fribble)) is the same as the second statement's conclusion (Not Snurgled(fribble)). If they are not the same, then we cannot make a conclusion about the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nHowever, in this case, the first statement's hypothesis and the second statement's conclusion are contradictory. If the fribble was snurgled, then it crinkled, but if the fribble did not crinkle, then it could not have been snurgled. Therefore, the first statement does imply the second statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
