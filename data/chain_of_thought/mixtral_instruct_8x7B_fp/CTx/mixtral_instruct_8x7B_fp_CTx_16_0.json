            "content": "Explanation: The given conditional statement \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" is in the form of \"If P, then Q\". We want to determine if the contrapositive \"If not Q, then not P\" is true. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nIn this case, P is \"the sneg was crampled\" and Q is \"the sneg sproted the frink\". The negation of P is \"the sneg was not crampled\" (not P), and the negation of Q is \"the sneg did not sprotet the frink\" (not Q). \n\nSo, the statement \"If the sneg did not sprotet the frink, then the sneg was not crampled\" is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement. Since contrapositives are logically equivalent, we can infer the given statement from its contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
