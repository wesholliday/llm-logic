            "content": "Explanation: This question is asking about the logical relationship between two statements, which is a concept covered in logic called contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". \n\nIn this case, the given statement is \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\". So, P represents \"the dreb was vroombed\" and Q represents \"the dreb was spened\".\n\nTo form the contrapositive, we first negate Q and P, which gives us \"the dreb was not spened\" and \"the dreb was not vroombed\", respectively. Then, we reverse the order to get \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\".\n\nTherefore, if the given statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
