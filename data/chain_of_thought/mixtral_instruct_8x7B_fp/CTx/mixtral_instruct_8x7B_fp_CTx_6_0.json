            "content": "Explanation: This question is asking about the logical relationship between two statements, which is a question of logical inference and the concept of contrapositive. The original statement is in the form \"if P then Q\", where P is \"the grommet was sploffed\" and Q is \"the grommet plopped the frink\". The statement we are asked to infer is in the form \"if not Q then not P\". \n\nIn logic, the statement \"if P then Q\" is logically equivalent to the statement \"if not Q then not P\". This is known as the concept of the contrapositive. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the inferred statement must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
