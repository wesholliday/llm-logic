            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical inference and the concept of contrapositive. The original statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garbled\" is in the form of \"If P, then Q\". The statement we want to infer is \"If the wug was not garbled, then the wug was not sproinged\", which is in the form of \"If not Q, then not P\". \n\nIn logic, the statement \"If P, then Q\" is logically equivalent to \"If not Q, then not P\". This is known as the law of contrapositive. \n\nTherefore, if the original statement is true, then the inferred statement \"If the wug was not garbled, then the wug was not sproinged\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
