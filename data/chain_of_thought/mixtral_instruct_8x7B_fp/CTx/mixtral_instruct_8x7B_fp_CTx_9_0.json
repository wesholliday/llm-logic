It means that if the condition (the twonk was plinked) is true, then the consequence (it was varnished) must also be true.\n\nTo determine if the converse 'If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked' can be inferred, we need to consider the possible scenarios. If the twonk was not varnished, then the original statement does not necessarily apply because it only discusses what happens when the twonk is plinked, not when it is not varnished. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: No."
