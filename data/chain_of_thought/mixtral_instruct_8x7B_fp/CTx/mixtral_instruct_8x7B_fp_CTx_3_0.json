We want to determine if the converse of this statement, \"If not Q, then not P\", is true.\n\nThe converse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". In this case, P is \"the splat was morphed\" and Q is \"the splat quanked\". So, \"not Q\" means \"the splat did not quank\" and \"not P\" means \"the splat was not morphed\".\n\nTherefore, the converse is \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed\".\n\nTo determine if this converse is true, we would need to consider the truth of this statement in the given context. However, without further information, we cannot definitively say whether this converse is true or false.\n\nAnswer: Cannot determine without additional context."
