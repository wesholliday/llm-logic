            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\" is in the form of a conditional statement, often called a material implication in logic. It can be represented as: Skizzled(flob) -> Movated(flob). \n\nWe want to determine if we can infer the statement \"If the flob did not movate, then the flob was not skizzled\", which can be represented as ~Movated(flob) -> ~Skizzled(flob).\n\nIn logic, this type of inference is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nTo form the contrapositive, we negate both the hypothesis and the conclusion of the original statement and then reverse the order. So, the contrapositive of \"If Skizzled(flob), then Movated(flob)\" is \"If not Movated(flob), then not Skizzled(flob)\".\n\nTherefore, from the original statement, we can indeed infer \"If the flob did not movate, then the flob was not skizzled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
