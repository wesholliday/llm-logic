            "content": "Explanation: This question is asking about the logical relationship between two statements. The original statement is a conditional statement, often called \"if-then\" statement in formal logic. It can be written as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the shank was plooked\" and Q is \"the shank was nugged\". \n\nThe statement we are asked to infer is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then swapping their order, resulting in \"If not Q, then not P\". In this case, \"not Q\" is \"the shank was not nugged\" and \"not P\" is \"the shank was not plooked\".\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a true conditional statement is also true. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then we can indeed infer its contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
