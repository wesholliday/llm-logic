It means that if the condition (zinger being fraggled) is true, then the consequence (zinger being smoogled) must also be true.\n\nHowever, the statement we want to infer is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the condition and the consequence and then swapping their positions. \n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be 'If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled'. This is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that 'If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
