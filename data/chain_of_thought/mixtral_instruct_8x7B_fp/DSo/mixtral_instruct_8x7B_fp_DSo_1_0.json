            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'Fido is not in the garden' means that Fido is somewhere else, not in the garden. The second statement, 'Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden', is a disjunction, meaning that Fido is either inside or in the garden, but not both. Since we know from the first statement that Fido is not in the garden, it must be the case that Fido is inside, as that is the only option left in the disjunction.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
