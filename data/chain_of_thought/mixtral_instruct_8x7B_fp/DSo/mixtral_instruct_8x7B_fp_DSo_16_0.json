The second statement, 'Either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk', is a disjunction, meaning that one or the other condition must be true. In this case, the pen can either be in the bag or on the desk. Since we know from the first statement that the pen is not on the desk, it follows that the pen must be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
