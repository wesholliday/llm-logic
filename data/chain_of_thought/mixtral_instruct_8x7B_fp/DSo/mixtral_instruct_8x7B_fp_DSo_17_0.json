Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it is draped on the coat rack.\n\nThe second statement can be broken down into two possibilities:\na. The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\nb. The scarf is draped on the coat rack.\n\nSince the first statement tells us that the scarf is not draped on the coat rack, this means that possibility (b) from the second statement is false. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is (a): The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
