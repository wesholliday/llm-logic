The second statement is a logical disjunction (OR) which means that one of the two possibilities must be true. Since the first statement asserts that the missing sock is not under the bed, and this option is included in the second statement, we can infer that the other option 'the missing sock is in the laundry basket' must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
