The second statement presents two possibilities: either the piece is in the box, or it's blending in on the floor. \n\nSince we've established that the missing piece is not blending in on the floor, it logically follows that the only remaining possibility from the second statement must be true. Therefore, the missing puzzle piece must be in the box.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
