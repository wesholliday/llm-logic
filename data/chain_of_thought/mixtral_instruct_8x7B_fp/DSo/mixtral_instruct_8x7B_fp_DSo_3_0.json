            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet' means that the keys are not in a specific location, namely dangling in the cabinet. The statement 'Either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet' is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two statements must be true. Since we know that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, it must be the case that the other statement, 'The keys are in the drawer', is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
