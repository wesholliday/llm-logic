The second statement presents two possibilities: the cat is napping on the couch or it's playing in the bedroom. \n\nSince we know from the first statement that the cat is not playing in the bedroom, the second possibility from the second statement must be true, which is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
