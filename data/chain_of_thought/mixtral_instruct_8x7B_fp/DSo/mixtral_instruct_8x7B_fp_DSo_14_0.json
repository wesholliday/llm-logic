            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The milk isn't chilling in the fridge' means that the milk is somewhere other than the fridge. The second statement, 'Either the milk is on the counter or it is chilling in the fridge', is a logical disjunction, meaning that the milk can be in only one of those two places. Since we know from the first statement that the milk is not in the fridge, it must therefore be in the other specified location, which is 'on the counter'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
