            "content": "Explanation: This question is a negation of the contrapositive of an original conditional statement. The original statement is: if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. The contrapositive of this statement is: if the mummy was not awake, then the vampire must not have been awake. The negation of this contrapositive is given in the question.\n\nThe negation of a conditional statement \"if P, then Q\" is \"P and not Q.\" So, the negation of the contrapositive is: the mummy was not awake and the vampire was awake.\n\nHowever, the question also states that it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake. This is equivalent to saying that the mummy was not awake.\n\nTaking both pieces of information together, we can infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
