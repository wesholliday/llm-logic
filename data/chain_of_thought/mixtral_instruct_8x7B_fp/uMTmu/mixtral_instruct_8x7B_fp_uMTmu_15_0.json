            "content": "Explanation: The first statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train\" is a conditional statement, where the condition is Sam taking a plane. The second statement \"it's not the case that Erin must have taken a train\" contradicts the first statement's conclusion when the condition is true. This means that the original conditional statement cannot be true, so its condition (Sam taking a plane) must be false. Therefore, Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
