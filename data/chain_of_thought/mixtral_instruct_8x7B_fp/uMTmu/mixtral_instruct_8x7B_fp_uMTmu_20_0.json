            "content": "Explanation: The first statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" is a conditional statement, often called if-then statement in logic. This statement tells us that if the apple is red, then the banana has to be yellow. However, it doesn't require that the apple must be red, nor does it require that the banana must be yellow.\n\nThe second statement \"it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow\" contradicts the conclusion of the first statement. If the banana must be yellow, then it cannot be the case that it's not necessary for the banana to be yellow.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that the first statement (the conditional statement) is not true in this context. Therefore, the apple cannot be red.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
