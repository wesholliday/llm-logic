However, we are also told that it's not the case that the pants must have been denim. This means that there is a possibility that the pants were not denim.\n\nNow, let's consider the first piece of information again - if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. Since we know that it's not necessarily true that the pants must have been denim, it follows that the shirt cannot be cotton. If the shirt were cotton, then the pants would have to be denim, but we've established that the pants don't have to be denim. Therefore, the shirt cannot be cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
