First, we know that \"if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This is a conditional statement, where the presence of the griffin in the forest implies the presence of the unicorn in the forest.\n\nHowever, the second piece of information states that \"it's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This means that the unicorn could have been somewhere else, not necessarily in the forest.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility of the griffin being in the forest. If the griffin were in the forest, then the unicorn would have to be in the forest as well (from the first piece of information). But we know that the unicorn could have been somewhere else, so it's possible for the unicorn not to be in the forest even if the griffin is.\n\nTherefore, the information provided does not allow us to definitively conclude that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: No."
