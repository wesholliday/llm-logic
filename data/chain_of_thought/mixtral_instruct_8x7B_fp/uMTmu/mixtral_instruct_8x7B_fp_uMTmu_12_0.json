It tells us that if Joe's condition is met (he went to the park), then Lucy's condition is also met (she went to the zoo).\n\nHowever, the second statement \"it's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" contradicts the first statement. This means that even if Joe went to the park, Lucy did not necessarily need to go to the zoo.\n\nThis apparent contradiction can be resolved by concluding that Joe probably did not go to the park. If Joe had gone to the park, then according to the first statement, Lucy should have gone to the zoo. But since we know that Lucy did not go to the zoo, it follows that Joe probably stayed home and did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
