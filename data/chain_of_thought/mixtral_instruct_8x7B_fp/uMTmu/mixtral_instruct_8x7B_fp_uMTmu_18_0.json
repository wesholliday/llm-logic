However, the next statement tells us that it's not the case that the truck must have been metal. This means that the truck could be made of some other material besides metal. Since the first statement is a conditional statement, and the condition (the truck being metal) is not met, we cannot conclude that the doll was plastic. But can the doll be plastic? No, because if the doll were plastic, then the truck would have to be metal. Since the truck is not necessarily metal, the doll cannot be plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
