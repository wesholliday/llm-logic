            "content": "Explanation: Given the first statement, if Tom watched football then Jen must have watched basketball. However, the second statement tells us that it's not necessarily true that Jen must have watched basketball. This creates a contradiction because if Tom did watch football, then Jen should be watching basketball, but she's not required to do so according to the second statement. Therefore, the only way to resolve this contradiction is to conclude that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
