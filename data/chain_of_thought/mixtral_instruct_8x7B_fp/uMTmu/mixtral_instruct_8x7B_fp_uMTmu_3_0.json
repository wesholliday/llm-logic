            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical puzzle that uses contradictory statements to test our reasoning skills. The first statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\" is a conditional statement that tells us that if a certain condition (the book being written by James) is true, then a certain consequence (the book being a mystery novel) must also be true. However, the second statement \"it's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel\" contradicts the consequence of the first statement. This means that the book cannot be both a mystery novel and not a mystery novel at the same time. Therefore, the condition stated in the first statement cannot be true, which means that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
