The phrase \"upon request\" indicates that the cleaning does not necessarily happen every day and is dependent on someone asking for it to be done. Therefore, the second scenario, \"The room might be cleaned upon request,\" is indeed a possibility that can be inferred from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
