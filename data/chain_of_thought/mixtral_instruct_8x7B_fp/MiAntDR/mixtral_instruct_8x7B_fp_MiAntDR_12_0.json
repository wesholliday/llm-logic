            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The project might be completed by Friday or extended\" presents two possible scenarios: either the project is completed by Friday, or it is extended. The statement does not explicitly say that the project will be extended, but it does imply that this is a possibility. This is because the \"or\" in the statement introduces the second possibility, which is different from the first one. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the project might be extended based on this information.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
