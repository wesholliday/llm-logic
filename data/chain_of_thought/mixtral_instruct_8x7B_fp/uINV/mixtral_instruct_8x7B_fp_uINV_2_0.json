However, it does not give any information about what would happen if the griffin was not in the forest. It could be that the unicorn is still in the forest, or it could be that the unicorn is somewhere else. Without further information, we cannot definitively say what would happen in the case that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: No."
