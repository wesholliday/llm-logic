It does not give any information about what would happen if the cake was not chocolate. For example, the baker could make a vanilla cake when not making a chocolate one, and still make blueberry muffins. Or, the baker could have a rule that if they're not making a chocolate cake, they make strawberry muffins instead. The statement as given does not let us infer that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nAnswer: No."
