This statement only tells us about the situation when the book is written by James (p), and in that case, the book is a mystery novel (q). It does not give any information about the situation when the book is not written by James. Therefore, we cannot make a definite inference about the book being not a mystery novel when it is not written by James.\n\nAnswer: No."
