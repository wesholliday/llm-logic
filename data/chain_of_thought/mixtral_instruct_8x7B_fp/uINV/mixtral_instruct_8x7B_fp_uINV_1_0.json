The original argument is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" The contrapositive of this argument is: \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original argument.\n\nHowever, the given information only allows us to make the first statement, not its contrapositive. We cannot assume that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding, because there could be other people at the wedding who would allow the first statement to be true even if Sue was not present.\n\nAnswer: No."
