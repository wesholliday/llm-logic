It tells us that whenever the condition (Alex finishing the race) is true, the consequence (Chris finishing the race) is also true.\n\nHowever, it does not tell us anything about what happens when the condition is false. In other words, if Alex did not finish the race, the statement doesn't specify whether Chris finished or not.\n\nTo infer that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race, we would need a contrapositive statement or an additional assumption linking the two events. Without this, we cannot make that inference.\n\nAnswer: No."
