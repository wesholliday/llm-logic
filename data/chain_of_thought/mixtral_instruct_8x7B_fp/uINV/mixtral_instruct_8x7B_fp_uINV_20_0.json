It does not cover all possibilities; it only states that if the condition (the apple being red) is met, then the consequence (the banana being yellow) follows.\n\nHowever, it does not tell us anything about what happens when the condition is not met. In other words, the statement doesn't claim that the banana must always be yellow, just that it is if the apple is red.\n\nAnswer: No."
