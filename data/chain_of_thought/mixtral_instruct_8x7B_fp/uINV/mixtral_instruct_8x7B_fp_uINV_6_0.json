A biconditional statement means that both conditions must be true or both conditions must be false. \n\nHowever, the original statement does not explicitly state that \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\" It only states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. Therefore, we cannot automatically infer that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: No."
