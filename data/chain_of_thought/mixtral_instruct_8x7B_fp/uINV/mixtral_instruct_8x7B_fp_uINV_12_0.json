The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". If the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nIn this case, the original statement is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\".\n\nIf we assume that the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, if Joe did not go to the park, we can infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
