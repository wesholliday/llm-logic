            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement, where the purchase of the red shirt by Lisa is the condition leading to the result that Mark bought the blue shirt. \n\nHowever, this does not guarantee that the absence of Lisa buying the red shirt would lead to Mark not buying the blue shirt. This is because there could be other reasons for Mark buying the blue shirt, not necessarily because Lisa bought the red shirt. \n\nFor example, it could be that Lisa and Mark agreed to buy each other's shirts as a surprise, and so when Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, Mark still bought the blue shirt for Lisa. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: No."
