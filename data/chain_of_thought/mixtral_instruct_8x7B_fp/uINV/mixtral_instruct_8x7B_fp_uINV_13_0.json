            "content": "Explanation:  The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement, specifically a Type 1 hypothetical statement (also known as a material implication). It tells us that if the condition (the car being red) is true, then the consequence (the truck being blue) must also be true.\n\nHowever, it does not tell us anything about what happens when the condition is false. In other words, it doesn't specify whether the truck's color is related to the car's color when the car is not red.\n\nThe statement \"if the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\" is a Type 2 hypothetical statement, also known as the contrapositive of the original statement. \n\nIn general, the contrapositive of a hypothetical statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. But without knowing whether the original statement is true or false, we can't determine whether its contrapositive is true or false.\n\nAnswer: No. The truth of the first statement does not allow us to infer the truth of the second statement."
