It only tells us that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. It does not tell us what happens if Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad. It is possible that if Ben did not eat pasta, Kate still ate salad. We do not have enough information to determine what happens in the case where Ben does not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: No."
