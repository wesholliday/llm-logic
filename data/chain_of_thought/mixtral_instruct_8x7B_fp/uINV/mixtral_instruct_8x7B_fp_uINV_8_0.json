It tells us that if the condition (the vampire being awake) is true, then the consequence (the mummy being awake) must also be true.\n\nHowever, this statement does not tell us anything about what happens when the condition is not true. In other words, it does not tell us whether the mummy is awake or not when the vampire is not awake. Therefore, we cannot make an inference about the mummy's state when the vampire is not awake based solely on this statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
