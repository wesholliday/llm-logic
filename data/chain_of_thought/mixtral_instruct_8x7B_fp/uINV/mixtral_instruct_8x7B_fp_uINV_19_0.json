            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical construct known as contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". If the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. In this case, the original statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\". The contrapositive would be \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\". Since we were not given any information about what happens when Tom does not watch football, we cannot directly conclude that Jen did not watch basketball in that case. However, if we knew that Tom and Jen's watching habits are such that the original statement is always true (i.e., whenever Tom watches football, Jen watches basketball), then we could indeed infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes, but only under the condition that the original statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is always true."
