However, it does not explicitly state that the absence of the bear in the cave guarantees the absence of the wolf in the den. It only tells us that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf is in the den. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that if the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\n\nAnswer: No."
