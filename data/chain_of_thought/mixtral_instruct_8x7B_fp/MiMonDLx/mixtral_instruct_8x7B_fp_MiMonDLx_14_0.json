However, it does not rule out other possible actions the zibble might take. The statement \"The zibble might snork frozz or be in flibbit wump\" is making a similar claim, but it is also including another possible action, 'be in flibbit wump'. Since the original statement does not exclude this possibility, we can infer the extended statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
