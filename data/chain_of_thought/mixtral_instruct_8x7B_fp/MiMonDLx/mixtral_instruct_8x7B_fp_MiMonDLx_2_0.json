However, it does not exclude the possibility that the blimple could be in other places, such as \"the wobble\". Without further information, we cannot rule out the possibility that the blimple might be in the wobble. Therefore, the statement \"The blimple might be on the flump\" does not contradict with \"The blimple might be on the flump or in the wobble\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
