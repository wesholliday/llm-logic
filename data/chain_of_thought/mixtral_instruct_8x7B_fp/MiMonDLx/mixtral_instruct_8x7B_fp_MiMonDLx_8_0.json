However, this does not exclude the possibility of the gribble being something else, such as a grazzle. In logical terms, \"The gribble might be quork\" does not imply that \"The gribble might be quork or grazzle\" is false. Rather, it suggests that the second statement could also be true. Therefore, the second statement can be inferred from the first, but only to the extent that the first statement does not rule out other possibilities.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
