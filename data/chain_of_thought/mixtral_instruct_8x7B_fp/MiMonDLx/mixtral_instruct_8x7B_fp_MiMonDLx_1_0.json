It's even possible that \"blurble\" could be \"plonk\" instead. However, the statement also doesn't rule out the possibility that \"blurble\" could be \"plonk\". Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot definitively say whether \"The blurble might be wibble a frozz or plonk\" is true or false.\n\nAnswer: No."
