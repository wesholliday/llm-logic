However, this statement does not exclude the possibility of the frazzle being a quimble or anything else other than a wump. The original statement is not exhaustive or exclusive in nature. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that 'The frazzle might be wump or quimble'. The two statements are not logically equivalent or nested.\n\nAnswer: No."
