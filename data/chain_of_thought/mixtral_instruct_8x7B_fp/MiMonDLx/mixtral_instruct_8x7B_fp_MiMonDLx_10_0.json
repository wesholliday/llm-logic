The statement does not exclude the possibility of other states or conditions for the snork.\n\nWhen considering \"The snork might be plonk or wobble,\" we are adding another possible condition, 'wobble,' to the snork. Since the original statement does not exclude other possibilities, and even implies that there could be other conditions for the snork, adding 'wobble' as another possibility is reasonable.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer \"The snork might be plonk or wobble\" from \"The snork might be plonk.\""
