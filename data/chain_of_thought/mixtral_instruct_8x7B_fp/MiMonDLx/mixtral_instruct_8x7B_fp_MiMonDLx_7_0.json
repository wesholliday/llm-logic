It does not exclude other possibilities, but it also does not explicitly include any other possibilities. Therefore, based on this statement alone, we cannot infer that 'The frazzle might be wozzle or on flump'. To make that inference, we would need additional information that includes the possibility of the frazzle being on flump.\n\nAnswer: No."
