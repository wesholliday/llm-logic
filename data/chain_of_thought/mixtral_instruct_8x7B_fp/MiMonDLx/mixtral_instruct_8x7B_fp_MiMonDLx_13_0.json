The statement \"The zooble might be quork or grazzle\" is more uncertain, suggesting that the zooble could be either a quork or a grazzle. \n\nThe original statement does not rule out the possibility that the zooble could be a grazzle, but it also does not provide any information suggesting that the zooble is a grazzle. Therefore, we cannot infer from the original statement that \"The zooble might be quork or grazzle\".\n\nAnswer: No."
