            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as a modus tollens argument in formal logic. The general structure of a modus tollens argument is: if P, then Q; not Q; therefore, not P. In this case, the argument is: if Jeff played basketball (P), then Amy must have played tennis (Q); Amy did not must have played tennis (not Q); therefore, Jeff did not play basketball (not P). Since the argument follows the structure of a modus tollens argument, which is a valid form of argument in formal logic, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
