            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called modus tollens in classical logic. The general form is: if P, then Q; not Q; therefore, not P. In this case, P represents 'Ben ate pasta' and Q represents 'Kate must have eaten salad'. The second premise 'It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad' is equivalent to 'not Q'. If it's true that if Ben ate pasta, Kate must have eaten salad, and it's also true that Kate did not eat salad, then it necessarily follows that Ben could not have eaten pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
