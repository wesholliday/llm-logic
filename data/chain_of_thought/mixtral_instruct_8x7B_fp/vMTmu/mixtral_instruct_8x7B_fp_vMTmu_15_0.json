            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called modus tollens in classical logic. The general form is: if P, then Q; not Q; therefore, not P. In this case, P represents 'Sam took a plane' and Q represents 'Erin must have taken a train'. If the first premise is true (if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train), and the second premise is also true (it's not the case that Erin must have taken a train), then the conclusion must be true as well (Sam did not take a plane). This is because if Erin didn't take a train, then Sam couldn't have taken a plane, assuming the first premise is true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
