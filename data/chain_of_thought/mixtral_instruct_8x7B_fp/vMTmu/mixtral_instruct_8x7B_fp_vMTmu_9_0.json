            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is logically valid based on the principle of transitive inference in logic. If the first premise states that 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt', it means that Lisa buying the red shirt is a sufficient condition for Mark buying the blue shirt. The second premise states that 'It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt', which means that Mark buying the blue shirt is not a fact or a necessary condition. Therefore, since Lisa buying the red shirt is a sufficient condition for Mark buying the blue shirt, and Mark buying the blue shirt is not a necessary condition, it follows that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is because if Lisa had bought the red shirt, then Mark would have had to buy the blue shirt, but since Mark did not buy the blue shirt, Lisa could not have bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
