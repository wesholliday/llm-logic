            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as a logical structure called modus tollens in classical logic. The general form of modus tollens is: if P, then Q; not Q; therefore, not P. In this case, the first premise 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta' can be translated as 'P implies Q'. The second premise 'It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta' can be translated as 'not Q'. Therefore, the conclusion 'Sue did not choose pizza' can be translated as 'not P'. Since the argument follows the structure of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
