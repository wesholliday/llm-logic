            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as modus tollens in classical logic. The general form is: if P, then Q; not Q; therefore, not P. In this case, P represents \"the dog was inside\" and Q represents \"the cat must have been outside\". The second premise, \"it's not the case that the cat must have been outside\", is equivalent to \"not Q\". The conclusion, \"the dog was not inside\", is equivalent to \"not P\". Since this argument follows the structure of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
