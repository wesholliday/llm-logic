            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as modus tollens in logic, where the general form is 'If P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.' In this case, the first premise 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den' can be rewritten as 'P -> Q'. The second premise 'It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den' can be rewritten as 'Not Q'. The conclusion 'The bear was not in the cave' can be rewritten as 'Not P'. As we can see, the argument follows the structure of modus tollens, which is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
