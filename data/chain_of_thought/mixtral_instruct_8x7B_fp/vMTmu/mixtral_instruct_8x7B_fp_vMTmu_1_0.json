The argument can be represented as:\n\nPremise 1: If P, then Q\nPremise 2: Not Q\nConclusion: Therefore, not P\n\nIn this case, P represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q represents \"Sue must have been at the wedding.\" The second premise denies that Sue must have been at the wedding, which means that Q is false. If the first premise is true, then the conclusion must be that Mary was not at the wedding (not P) in order to avoid the contradiction of a false Q when P is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
