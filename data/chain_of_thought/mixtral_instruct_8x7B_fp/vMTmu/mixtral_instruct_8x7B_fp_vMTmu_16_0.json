            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as modus tollens in logic, where the structure is: if P, then Q; not Q; therefore, not P. In this case, P represents 'the shirt was cotton' and Q represents 'the pants must have been denim'. The second premise 'it's not the case that the pants must have been denim' is equivalent to 'not Q'. Therefore, the conclusion 'the shirt was not cotton' or 'not P' follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
