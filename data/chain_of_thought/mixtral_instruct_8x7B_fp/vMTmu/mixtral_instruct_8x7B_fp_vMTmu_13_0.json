The argument can be represented as:\n\nP1: If A, then B\nP2: Not B\nC: Therefore, not A\n\nIn this case, A represents 'the car was red' and B represents 'the truck must have been blue'. If the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. If the truck was not blue (not B), then it follows that the car could not have been red (not A).\n\nAnswer: Yes."
