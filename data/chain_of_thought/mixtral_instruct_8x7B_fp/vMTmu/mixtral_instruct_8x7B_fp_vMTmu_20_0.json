            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as modus tollens in classical logic. The general form is: \"If P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\" In this case, the first premise \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" can be restated as \"If P (the apple was red), then Q (the banana must have been yellow)\". The second premise \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow\" is restated as \"Not Q\". Therefore, according to modus tollens, we can validly infer \"Not P\", or in this case, \"The apple was not red\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
