            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as modus tollens in formal logic. The general structure of modus tollens is: if P, then Q; not Q; therefore, not P. In this case, the first premise corresponds to P, the conclusion corresponds to not P, and the second premise corresponds to not Q. Since the argument follows the structure of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
