            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as modus tollens in logic, where the structure is 'if P, then Q; not Q; therefore, not P'. In this case, P represents 'Tom watched football' and Q represents 'Jen must have watched basketball'. The second premise 'It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball' is equivalent to 'not Q'. Therefore, the argument follows the structure of modus tollens and is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
