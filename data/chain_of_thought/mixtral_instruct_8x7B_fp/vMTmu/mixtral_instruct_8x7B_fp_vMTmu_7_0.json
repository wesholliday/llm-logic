            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called modus tollens in logic, where the general form is \"If P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\" In this case, the first premise \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race\" can be translated to \"If Alex finished the race (P), then Chris finished the race (Q).\" The second premise \"It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race\" can be translated to \"Not Q.\" Therefore, the conclusion \"Alex did not finish the race\" can be translated to \"Not P.\" Since this follows the structure of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true as well.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
