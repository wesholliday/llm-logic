            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as modus tollens in logic, where the structure is: if P, then Q; not Q; therefore, not P. In this case, P represents 'the cake was chocolate' and Q represents 'the muffins must have been blueberry'. The second premise 'it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry' is equivalent to 'not Q'. Therefore, if the premises are true, the conclusion 'the cake was not chocolate' or 'not P' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
