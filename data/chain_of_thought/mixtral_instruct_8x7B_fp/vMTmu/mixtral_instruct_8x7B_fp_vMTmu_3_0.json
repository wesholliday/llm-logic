            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as modus tollens in logic, where the structure is 'if P, then Q; not Q; therefore, not P'. In this case, P represents 'the book was written by James' and Q represents 'the book must be a mystery novel'. The second premise 'It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel' is stating that not Q is true. Given these premises, if the book was written by James, it would have to be a mystery novel, but since it's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel, it follows that the book was not written by James. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
