            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as a logical argument by contradiction, where the conclusion negates one of the premises to show that the initial assumption (that Joe went to the park) leads to a contradiction. In this case, the argument follows the structure of modus tollens in formal logic, which is:\n\n1. If P, then Q. (P -> Q)\n2. Not Q. (~Q)\n3. Therefore, not P. (~P)\n\nHere, P is 'Joe went to the park' and Q is 'Lucy must have gone to the zoo'. The first premise is the conditional statement, the second premise negates the consequence, and the conclusion negates the initial assumption.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
