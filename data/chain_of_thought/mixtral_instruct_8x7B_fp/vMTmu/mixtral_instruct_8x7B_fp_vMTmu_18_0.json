            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as Modus Tollens in formal logic. The general structure of Modus Tollens is: if P, then Q; not Q; therefore, not P. \n\nIn this case, P represents 'the doll was plastic', and Q represents 'the truck must have been metal'. The second premise, 'It's not the case that the truck must have been metal', is equivalent to 'not Q'. Therefore, if the argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens correctly, we can infer 'not P', which means 'the doll was not plastic'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
