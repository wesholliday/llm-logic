            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is logically valid based on the principle of transitive reasoning. If the first premise states that 'if A then B', and the second premise states 'not B', then the conclusion can be logically inferred as 'not A'. In this case, A represents 'the griffin was in the forest' and B represents 'the unicorn must have been in the forest'. Therefore, if it's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest, then it follows that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
