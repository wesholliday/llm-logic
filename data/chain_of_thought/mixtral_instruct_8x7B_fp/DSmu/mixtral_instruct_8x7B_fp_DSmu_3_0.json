            "content": "Explanation: This is a logical reasoning question that involves negation and disjunction (or). The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" can be represented as p \u2228 q, where p represents \"The keys are in the drawer\" and q represents \"They must be dangling in the cabinet\". The negation of q is given as \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\", which can be represented as \u00acq.\n\nNow, if \u00acq is true, then it means that q is false. Therefore, the disjunction p \u2228 q reduces to just p, since the other disjunct q is false. Hence, we can indeed infer that 'The keys are in the drawer' (p) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
