            "content": "Explanation: This is a logical reasoning question that involves the concept of disjunction (or) and negation (not).  The statement \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack\" presents two possible scenarios for the location of the scarf, using the word \"or\".  In logic, \"or\" is exclusive when it's accompanied by words like \"either\", which means only one of the scenarios can be true.\n\nThe second statement, \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack\", negates the second scenario.  If it's not necessary that the scarf is on the coat rack, then it can't be on the coat rack.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can indeed infer that 'The scarf is stuffed in my backpack' because if the second scenario is not possible (the scarf is not on the coat rack), then the first scenario must be true (the scarf is in the backpack).\n\nAnswer: Yes."
