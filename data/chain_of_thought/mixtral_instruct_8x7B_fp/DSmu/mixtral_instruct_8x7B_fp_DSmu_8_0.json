            "content": "Explanation: This is a logical reasoning question that involves disjunctive syllogism, a form of argument in classical logic. The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two possibilities (also known as the logical OR condition) - the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch.\n\nThe second statement, \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" negates the second possibility in the first statement. In other words, it tells us that the remote control is not necessarily under the couch, leaving open the possibility that it might be there, but it could also be somewhere else.\n\nHowever, since the first statement only provides two possibilities and the second statement rules out one of them, we can infer that the remaining possibility must be true. Therefore, if the remote control is not under the couch, then it must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
