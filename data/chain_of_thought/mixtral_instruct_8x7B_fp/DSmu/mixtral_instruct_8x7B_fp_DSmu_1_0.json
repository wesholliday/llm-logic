            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' is a logical disjunction, meaning that it's true if at least one of its components is true. In this case, the components are 'Fido is inside' and 'Fido must be in the garden'.\n\nThe statement 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' is the negation of 'Fido must be in the garden'. \n\nIf 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' is true, then 'Fido must be in the garden' is false. \n\nSince the first statement 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' is a disjunction, and one of its components ('Fido must be in the garden') is false, the only way for the whole statement to be true is if the other component ('Fido is inside') is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
