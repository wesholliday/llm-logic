            "content": "Explanation: This question involves logical reasoning using the concept of negation and the laws of excluded middle. The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two options must be true. The second statement, \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" negates the second option of the first statement. If the second option is false, then by the laws of excluded middle, the first option must be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes."
