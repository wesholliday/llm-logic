            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive. A contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion of a conditional statement and then reversing the order. In this case, the original statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\". Its contrapositive would be \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\". The argument given, however, has the conclusion in the form of the contrapositive, but not the premise. For the argument to be valid, the premise should be the original statement or its contrapositive. Here, the premise is the contrapositive of the original statement. Therefore, the argument is valid because it preserves the truth value of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
