            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive, which is a logically equivalent form of the original conditional statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"if P, then Q\" is \"if not Q, then not P\". In this case, the premise can be written as \"alien visited Mars\" implies \"robot visited Jupiter\", and its contrapositive would be \"if robot did not visit Jupiter, then alien did not visit Mars\". The conclusion given is also the contrapositive of the premise. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true. Hence, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
