            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive. A contrapositive statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion of the original conditional statement and then swapping them. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nIn this case, the original statement is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\". Its contrapositive is \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\". The given argument, however, has the form \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton\", which is not the contrapositive of the original statement. It's actually the original statement itself, but with switched components.\n\nBut even if we compare the given argument to the original statement (not the contrapositive), it's still not logically valid. The original statement says that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim. It doesn't say that if the pants are denim, then the shirt is cotton. The given argument makes this additional claim, which is not supported by the original premise.\n\nAnswer: No."
