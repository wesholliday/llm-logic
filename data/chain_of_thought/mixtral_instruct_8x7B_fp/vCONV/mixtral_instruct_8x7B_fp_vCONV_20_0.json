            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive. A contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion of the original conditional statement and then reversing the order. If the original statement is logically valid, then its contrapositive is also logically valid. In this case, the original statement is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'. Its contrapositive is 'If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red', or equivalently, 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red'. Since the original statement is logically valid, its contrapositive is also logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
