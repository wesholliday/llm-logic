            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive, which is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement. The original statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" can be restated as \"Only if Amy played tennis, Jeff played basketball\" or \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\". The conclusion \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball\" is the contrapositive of the original statement. Since contrapositive is logically equivalent, this form of argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
