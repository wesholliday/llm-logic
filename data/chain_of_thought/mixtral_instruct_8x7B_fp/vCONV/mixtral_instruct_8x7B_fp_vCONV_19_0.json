            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive. A contrapositive statement is created by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion of the original conditional statement, and then switching the positions of the two. In this case, the original statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\". Its contrapositive is \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\". The given argument, however, has the form \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football\". This is not the contrapositive of the original statement, but rather the inverse. The inverse statement is logically equivalent to the original statement only if the original statement is a tautology (a statement that is always true). In this case, the original statement is not a tautology, so its inverse is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No."
