            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive, which is a logically equivalent form of the original conditional statement. The contrapositive of a statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. In this case, the premise 'If the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den' can be restated as 'If bear in case, then wolf in den', and its contrapositive is 'If not wolf in den, then not bear in case', which is equivalent to 'If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the case'. Therefore, the conclusion 'If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case' is the opposite of the contrapositive of the premise. Hence, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No."
