            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive. A contrapositive is created by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion of the original conditional statement, and then switching the order. In this case, the original conditional statement is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\". Its contrapositive is \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake\", which is logically equivalent to the original statement. The argument form given, however, has switched the hypothesis and conclusion of the contrapositive, resulting in \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake\". This does not affect the logical validity of the argument, as it is still equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
