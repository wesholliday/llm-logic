The original argument can be represented as:\n\nPremise: P -> Q (If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel)\nConclusion: Q -> P (If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James)\n\nThe contrapositive of the original argument is:\n\n~Q -> ~P (If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James)\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original argument, if the original argument is valid, then the contrapositive is also valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
