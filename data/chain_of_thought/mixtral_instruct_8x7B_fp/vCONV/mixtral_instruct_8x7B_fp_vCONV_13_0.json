            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive. A contrapositive is created by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion of the original conditional statement and then reversing the order. In this case, the original statement is 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'. Its contrapositive is 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red', or equivalently, 'If the truck was red, then the car was not red'. The given argument 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' implies 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red', but not 'If the truck was blue, then the car was red'. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No."
