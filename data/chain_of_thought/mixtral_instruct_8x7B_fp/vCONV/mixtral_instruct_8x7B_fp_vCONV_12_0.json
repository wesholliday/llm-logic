            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive. A contrapositive is created by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion of the original conditional statement and then reversing the order. In this case, the original statement is 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo', and its contrapositive is 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park'. The given argument 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' implies 'If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park' which is the contrapositive of the original statement. Since the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
