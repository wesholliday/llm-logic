            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called contrapositive, which is a logically equivalent form of a conditional statement. The original conditional statement is \"If Alex finished the race (A), then Chris finished the race (C)\". The contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then reversing the order: \"If Chris didn't finish the race (~C), then Alex didn't finish the race (~A)\". The given argument \"If Chris finished the face (sic), then Alex finished the race\" is the contrapositive of the original statement, as the hypothesis and conclusion have been negated and reversed. Since contrapositives are logically equivalent to the original statements, this form of argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
