            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive. A contrapositive is created by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion of a conditional statement and then reversing the order. In this case, the original conditional statement is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'. Its contrapositive is 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding'. However, the given argument's conclusion is 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding', which is the converse, not the contrapositive, of the original statement. The converse of a conditional statement switches the hypothesis and conclusion. \n\nThe converse of a statement does not necessarily have the same truth value as the original statement. For example, consider the true statement 'If it is raining, then the ground is wet'. Its converse 'If the ground is wet, then it is raining' is not necessarily true, as the ground could be wet for reasons other than rain.\n\nAnswer: No."
