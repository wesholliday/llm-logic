            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called contrapositive, which is a logically equivalent form of the original conditional statement. The contrapositive of a proposition \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". In this case, the premise \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" can be restated as \"If Sam did not take a train, then Erin did not take a plane\". This is the contrapositive of the conclusion \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane\", which can be restated as \"If Erin did not take a plane, then Sam did not take a train\". Since contrapositives are logically equivalent, this form of argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
