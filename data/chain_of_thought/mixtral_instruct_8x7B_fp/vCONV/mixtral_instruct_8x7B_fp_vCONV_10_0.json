            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called contrapositive, which is a logically equivalent form of a conditional statement. The original statement is \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\". Its contrapositive is \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside\". The given argument, however, has the opposite order of the original statement and its contrapositive. It is still considered valid because the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion remains the same, even if the order is reversed.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
