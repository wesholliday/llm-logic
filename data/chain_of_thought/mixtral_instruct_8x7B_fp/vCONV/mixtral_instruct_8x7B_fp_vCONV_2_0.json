            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive, which is a logically equivalent form of the original conditional statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"if P, then Q\" is \"if not Q, then not P\". In this case, the premise \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" can be written as \"if griffin in forest, then unicorn in forest\", and its contrapositive is \"if not unicorn in forest, then not griffin in forest\", which is equivalent to the conclusion \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest\". Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
