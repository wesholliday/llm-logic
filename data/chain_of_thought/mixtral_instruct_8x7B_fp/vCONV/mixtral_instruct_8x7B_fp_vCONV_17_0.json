            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive. A contrapositive is created by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion of the original conditional statement, and then switching the order. In this case, the original statement is 'Ben ate pasta' implies 'Kate ate salad', and its contrapositive is 'Kate did not eat salad' implies 'Ben did not eat pasta'. Since the conclusion of the given argument is 'If Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta', which is the contrapositive of the original statement, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
