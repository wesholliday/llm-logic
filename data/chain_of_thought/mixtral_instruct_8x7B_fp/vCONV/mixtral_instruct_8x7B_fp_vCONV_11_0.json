            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive. A contrapositive is created by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion of the original conditional statement and then reversing the order. In this case, the original conditional statement is \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\" However, the argument presented has the conclusion in the opposite order, which would make it \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was chocolate.\" This is still logically equivalent to the original statement, so the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
