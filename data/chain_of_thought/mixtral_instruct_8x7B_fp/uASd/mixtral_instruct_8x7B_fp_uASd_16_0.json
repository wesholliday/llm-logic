It does not account for any other factors that might affect the lawn's growth, such as drought conditions. In a drought, even a fertilized lawn may struggle to stay lush and green due to insufficient water. Therefore, we cannot infer that the lawn will be lush and green just because it has been fertilized and there is a drought.\n\nAnswer: No."
