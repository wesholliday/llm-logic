            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If I study hard, I will pass the test\" only gives the condition for passing the test as studying hard. It does not specify anything about the language of the test. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that passing the Chinese test is also guaranteed by studying hard. The statement \"if I study hard and the test is in Chinese, I will pass the test\" introduces a new variable, the language of the test, which was not part of the original condition. Without specific information about how the language of the test affects the outcome, we cannot make a definitive conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No."
