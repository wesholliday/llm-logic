However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the package is misrouted after it has shipped. If the package is misrouted, it might not arrive today as it could be delayed due to being sent to the wrong location. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today.\n\nAnswer: No."
