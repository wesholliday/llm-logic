It does not account for other events that might happen concurrently, such as a bomb going off. The statement only applies when the condition (going to the concert) is met and does not extend to other scenarios.\n\nTherefore, based on the original statement, we cannot infer that if a bomb goes off at the concert, then we'll still have a good time.\n\nAnswer: No."
