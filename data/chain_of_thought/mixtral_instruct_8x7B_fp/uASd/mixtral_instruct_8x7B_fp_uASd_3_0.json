However, it does not cover all possible scenarios. In particular, it does not tell us what happens when the garage is flooding. In general, we cannot infer that the car would still be safe if the garage is flooding, because the original statement does not give us enough information about how the car's safety relates to a flooding garage.\n\nAnswer: No."
