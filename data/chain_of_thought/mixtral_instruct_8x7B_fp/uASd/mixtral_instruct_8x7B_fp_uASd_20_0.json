In this case, substituting \"medication that expired\" for \"medication\" does not necessarily mean the conclusion will still be true.\n\nExpired medication may not have the same therapeutic effect, and in some cases, could even be harmful. Therefore, we cannot infer that taking expired medication will make one feel better.\n\nAnswer: No."
