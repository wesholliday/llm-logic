It does not tell us anything about what happens if the bill is paid but the payment somehow fails, such as a bounced check. In other words, the original statement does not exclude the possibility of the services stopping even if the bill is paid, for example if there is some other condition that must also be met. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that the services will continue if the bill is paid and the check bounces.\n\nAnswer: No."
