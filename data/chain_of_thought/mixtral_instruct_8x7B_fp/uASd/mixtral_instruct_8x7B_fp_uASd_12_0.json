This means that finishing homework is necessary to play video games, but it doesn't mean that finishing homework is sufficient for playing video games. There could be other conditions or factors that also need to be met.\n\nIn the scenario where your computer catches on fire, this adds an additional condition that was not included in the original statement. The fact that you've finished your homework doesn't make any difference if you can't use your computer to play video games. Therefore, the truth of the original statement does not extend to this new scenario.\n\nAnswer: No."
