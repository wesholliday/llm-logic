However, this statement does not cover all possible scenarios. It does not tell us what happens when the oven is on but there is no pilot light. The pilot light could be the source of heat for the oven, and if it's out, the oven might not produce enough heat to make the kitchen warm. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that if the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm.\n\nAnswer: No."
