If the match has been soaked in water, it will not be able to ignite because water extinguishes fire and prevents the match from producing a flame. Therefore, the initial statement \"If the match is struck, then it will light\" does not hold true when additional conditions, like the match being soaked in water, are introduced.\n\nAnswer: No."
