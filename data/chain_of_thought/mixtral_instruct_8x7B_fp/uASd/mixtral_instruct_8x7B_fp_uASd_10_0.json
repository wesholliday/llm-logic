However, this statement does not cover the scenario where the order is placed but the item is out of stock. In such a case, the original rule does not necessarily apply, and we cannot directly infer whether the item will ship or not. We would need additional information about the store's policy on out-of-stock items to make a conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No."
