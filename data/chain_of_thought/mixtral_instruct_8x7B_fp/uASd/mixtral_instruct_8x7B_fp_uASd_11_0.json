It does not make any claims about the effects of doing hard labor. Even if we assume that getting enough sleep prevents tiredness, it doesn't necessarily mean that doing hard labor won't cause tiredness. Therefore, we cannot infer from the original statement that if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired.\n\nAnswer: No."
