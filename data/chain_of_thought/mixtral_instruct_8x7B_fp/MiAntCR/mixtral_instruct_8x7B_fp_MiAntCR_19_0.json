The application could be a physical form that requires written references, or it could be an online application that includes a section for electronic references. When you mention the possibility of completing the application online, you are making an assumption that is not supported by the given information. Therefore, we cannot infer that the application might be completed online and include references based solely on the statement \"The application might include references\".\n\nAnswer: No."
