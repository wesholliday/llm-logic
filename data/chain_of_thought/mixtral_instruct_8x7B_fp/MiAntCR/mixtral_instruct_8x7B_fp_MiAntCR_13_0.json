It's possible that the movie is in a language other than English and has subtitles in English, or it could be in English and have subtitles in another language. The original statement doesn't give us enough information to determine whether the movie is in English or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The movie might be in English and have subtitles.\"\n\nAnswer: No."
