            "content": "Explanation: Notarization is a process in which a document is authenticated by a notary public. The notary public verifies the identity of the signer(s), ensures that they are signing voluntarily, and in some jurisdictions, may also confirm that the signer understands the contents of the document. Notarization often, but not always, involves the signer signing the document in the presence of the notary public. Therefore, if a document might be notarized, it is possible that it might also be signed and notarized. However, it is also possible that the document has already been signed and is being brought to the notary public for notarization. Without more context, we cannot say for certain whether the document will be signed and notarized.\n\nAnswer: Yes, because notarization often involves the signer signing the document in the presence of the notary public, it is possible that the document might be signed and notarized if it might be notarized."
