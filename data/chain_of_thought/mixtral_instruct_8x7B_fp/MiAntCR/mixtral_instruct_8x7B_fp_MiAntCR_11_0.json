The reason could be an update, a bug fix, a routine restart, or any other number of things. Without more information, we cannot definitively say that the software will be updated and restarted. It is possible, but not certain.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the software will be updated and restarted based solely on the statement \"The software might be restarted.\""
