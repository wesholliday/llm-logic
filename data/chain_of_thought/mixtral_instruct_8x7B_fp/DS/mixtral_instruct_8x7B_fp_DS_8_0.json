The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch\" means that the remote control can only be in one of two places: on the coffee table or under the couch. If we are then told that \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch,\" this negates one of the original possibilities, leaving us with only one option: the remote control must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
