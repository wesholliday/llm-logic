The two possibilities are 'Fido is inside' and 'Fido is in the garden'. \n\nThe second statement 'Fido is not in the garden' negates one of these possibilities, leaving us with only one possibility: 'Fido is inside'. Therefore, based on this information, we can indeed infer that 'Fido is inside'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
