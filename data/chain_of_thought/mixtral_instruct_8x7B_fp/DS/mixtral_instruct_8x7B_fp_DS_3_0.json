            "content": "Explanation: This is a logical reasoning question that involves disjunction elimination, also known as proof by cases. The statement 'Either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet' presents two possible cases: the keys are in the drawer or the keys are dangling in the cabinet. The statement 'The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet' negates one of these cases. Therefore, based on the law of excluded middle (which states that any statement is either true or its negation is true), we can infer that the keys must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
