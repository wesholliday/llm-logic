A disjunctive syllogism is an argument form which takes the form:\n\nP or Q\nNot-P\n-----------------\nTherefore, Q\n\nIn this case, 'Either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry' is the disjunction (P or Q). 'The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry' is the negation of the second disjunct (Not-P). Therefore, according to the rules of disjunctive syllogism, we can infer that 'The cookies are in the jar' (Q).\n\nAnswer: Yes."
