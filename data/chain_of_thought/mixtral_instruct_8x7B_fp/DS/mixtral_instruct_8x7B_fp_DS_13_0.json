            "content": "Explanation: This is a logical argument in the form of a disjunction (or) statement, where either 'the toy is in the toy box' or 'it is sitting on the shelf'. The negation of the second part of the disjunction, 'The toy isn't sitting on the shelf', means that the toy cannot be found on the shelf. Since the disjunction only provides two possible locations for the toy, and one of them has been ruled out, it follows that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
