Disjunctive syllogism states that if either A or B is true, and A is false, then B must be true.\n\nIn this case, the original statement is: Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist. This can be broken down into: Watch is charging on the dresser (P) or Watch is on his wrist (Q).\n\nWe are then given the additional information: The watch isn't on his wrist (not Q).\n\nGiven the rules of disjunctive syllogism, since not Q is true, then P must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
