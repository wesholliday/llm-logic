            "content": "Explanation: This is a case of applying logical reasoning, specifically modus ponens and modus tollens. Modus ponens is a rule of inference that has the form \"P \u2192 Q, P, therefore Q\". Modus tollens is a rule of inference that has the form \"P \u2192 Q, \u00acQ, therefore \u00acP\".\n\nIn this case, we are given \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it's under the bed\" which can be written as \"Missing sock in laundry basket \u2228 Missing sock under bed\". This is the first premise. The second premise is \"Missing sock not under bed\" or \"\u00ac Missing sock under bed\".\n\nWe want to infer \"Missing sock in laundry basket\". This is of the form \"Missing sock in laundry basket\" or \"Missing sock in laundry basket \u2228 Missing sock under bed\" which follows from the first premise by disjunctive syllogism, a rule of inference that allows us to infer Q from P \u2228 Q and \u00acP.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
