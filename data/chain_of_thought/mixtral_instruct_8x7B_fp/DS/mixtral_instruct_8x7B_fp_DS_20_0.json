            "content": "Explanation: This is a logical reasoning question that involves disjunctive syllogism, a form of argument in classical logic. The statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are perched on her head\" is a disjunction, meaning it consists of two parts joined by the word \"or\". The statement \"The sunglasses aren't perched on her head\" is the negation of the second part of the disjunction. \n\nWhen we have a disjunction and the negation of one of its parts, we can infer the other part. This is because if the first part were true, then the whole disjunction would be true, making the second part (which we know is false) unnecessary. Therefore, the first part must be false, and the second part must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
