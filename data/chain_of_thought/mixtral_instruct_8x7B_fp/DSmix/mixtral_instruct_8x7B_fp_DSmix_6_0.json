            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped\" can be broken down into two parts: 1) the grommet is sploffed, or 2) if the grommet is not plopped, then it must be in the sploffed state. The second part means that the only alternative to plopping the grommet is to sploff it. Given that \"The grommet might not be plopped,\" it implies that there's a possibility that the grommet is not in the plopped state. Since the only other option for the grommet, according to the first statement, is to be sploffed, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
