            "content": "Explanation:  The statement \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked\" implies that if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed. This is because of the word \"or\" which in this context means \"one or the other but not both\".  The second statement \"The splat might not be quanked\" tells us that there is a possibility that the splat is not quanked.  Since the first statement tells us that if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed, we can infer that the splat is indeed morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
