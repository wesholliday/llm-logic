The second statement is \"The flob might not be movated,\" which introduces uncertainty about the flob being movated. However, this statement does not explicitly deny that the flob could be skizzled. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The flob is skizzled.\"\n\nAnswer: No."
