The second statement is 'The flug might not be zimmed', which implies that it's possible for the flug not to be zimmed. \n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that the flug is blummed. It could be the case that the flug is neither blummed nor zimmed, or that it's zimmed but we just haven't realized it yet. \n\nAnswer: No."
