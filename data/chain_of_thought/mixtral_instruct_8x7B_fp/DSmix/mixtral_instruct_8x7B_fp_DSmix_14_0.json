The second statement is \"The clug might not be snugged,\" which implies that there is a possibility that the clug is not snugged. \n\nIf there is a possibility that the clug is not snugged, then the second part of the first statement, \"it must be snugged,\" cannot be true. Therefore, the first statement \"The clug is fleeked or it must be snugged\" implies that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
