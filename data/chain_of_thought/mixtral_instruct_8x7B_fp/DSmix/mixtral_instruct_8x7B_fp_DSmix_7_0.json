The word \"or\" in this context is exclusive, meaning that only one of the two possibilities can be true.\n\nThe statement \"The whiffle might not be tinked\" indicates that there is a possibility that the whiffle is not tinked. Since the \"or\" in the first statement is exclusive, and there is a possibility that the whiffle is not tinked, it must be the case that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
