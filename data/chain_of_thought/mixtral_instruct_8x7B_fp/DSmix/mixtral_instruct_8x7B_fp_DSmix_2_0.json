The second statement is 'The wug might not be bimmed', which suggests that the second component statement in the disjunction, 'it must be bimmed', is not necessarily true. Therefore, in order for the entire disjunction to be true, the first component statement, 'the wug is flooped', must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
