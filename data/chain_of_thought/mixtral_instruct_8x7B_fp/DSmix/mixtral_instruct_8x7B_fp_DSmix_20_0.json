It could be bluttered, or it must be surned if it is not bluttered. \n\nThe second statement, 'The fleeg might not be surned', tells us that there is a possibility that the fleeg is not in the state of being surned. This does not necessarily mean that the fleeg is bluttered, it just means that there is a chance that it is not surned.\n\nHowever, this information still falls within the two possibilities presented in the first statement. The fleeg can either be bluttered or must be surned if it is not bluttered. The second statement does not rule out the possibility that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nTherefore, based on this logical reasoning, we can infer that 'The fleeg is bluttered' is a possibility.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
