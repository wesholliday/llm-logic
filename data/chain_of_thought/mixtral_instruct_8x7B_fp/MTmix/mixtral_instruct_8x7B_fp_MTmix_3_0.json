            "content": "Explanation: The given conditional statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked\" means that morphing the splat is a sufficient condition for quanking it. However, the statement \"The splat might not have quanked\" means that quanking the splat is not a necessary condition, i.e., there could be cases where the splat was not quanked.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot infer that \"The splat was not morphed\" because the first statement only tells us that morphing the splat is sufficient for quanking it, not that it is necessary. It is possible that the splat was morphed but not quanked, or that it was not morphed and not quanked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot make a definitive statement about whether the splat was morphed or not.\n\nAnswer: No."
