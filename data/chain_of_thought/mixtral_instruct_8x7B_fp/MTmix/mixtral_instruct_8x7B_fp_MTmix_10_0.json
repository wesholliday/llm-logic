            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garbled' is a conditional statement, often called an 'if-then' statement. It tells us that if the wug was sproinged, then it was necessarily garbled. However, it does not tell us that a garbled wug must have been sproinged, only that a sproinged wug is garbled.\n\nThe statement 'It might not have been garbled' tells us that there is a possibility that the wug was not garbled.\n\nNow, if the wug was not garbled, then it cannot be true that if it was sproinged, it was garbled. Therefore, if we assume that the second statement is true, then the first statement cannot be true, and so the wug was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
