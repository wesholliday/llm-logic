The shank might not have been nugged.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the shank was plooked, then it must follow that the shank was nugged. The second statement, however, tells us that there is a possibility that the shank was not nugged.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n- If the shank was not nugged, then according to the first statement, the shank could not have been plooked either.\n- If the shank might not have been nugged, then it's possible that the shank was not nugged, and in that case, as per the first statement, the shank could not have been plooked.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that 'The shank was not plooked' based on the given statements. Instead, the given statements lead us to infer that 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged', and 'The shank might not have been nugged', which in turn implies that 'The shank might not have been plooked' either."
