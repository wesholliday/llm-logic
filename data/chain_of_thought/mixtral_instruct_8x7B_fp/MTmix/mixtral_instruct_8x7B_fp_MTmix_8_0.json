            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled' is a conditional statement, often referred to as if-then or implication. It means that cranking the sprocket results in the sprocket being daggled. However, it does not mean that daggled sprocket always implies that it was cranked.\n\nThe statement 'The sprocket might not have been daggled' indicates that there is a possibility that the sprocket was not daggled. Given this information, we cannot definitively conclude that the sprocket was not cranked. It's possible that the sprocket was cranked and then stopped being daggled for some other reason.\n\nAnswer: No."
