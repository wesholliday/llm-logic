These two options are mutually exclusive, meaning that if the report is accurate, it hasn't been revised, and if the report has been revised, it wasn't accurate in its initial form.\n\nGiven this information, we cannot infer that 'The report must have been revised' because the first scenario, 'The report must have been accurate', contradicts this conclusion. We would need additional information or context to determine which of these two possibilities is true.\n\nAnswer: No."
