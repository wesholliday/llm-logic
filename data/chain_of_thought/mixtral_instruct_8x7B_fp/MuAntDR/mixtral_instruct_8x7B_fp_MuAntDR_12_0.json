The project must have been completed by Friday.\n2. The project must have been extended.\n\nThe word \"or\" in this context indicates that at least one of these conditions must be true. However, it does not necessarily mean that both conditions are true. It is possible that the project was completed by Friday, in which case the second condition would not apply.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that \"The project must have been extended.\"\n\nAnswer: No."
