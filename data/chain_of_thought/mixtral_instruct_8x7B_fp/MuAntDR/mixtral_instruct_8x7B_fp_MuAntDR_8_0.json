However, just because one part is true (that the restaurant was closed on Monday), it doesn't necessarily mean the other part is true (that the restaurant was open for limited hours). It's possible that the restaurant was closed on Monday and open for its usual hours the rest of the week. Without further information, we cannot infer that the restaurant was open for limited hours. Answer: No."
