If we want to determine if we can infer that the package was delivered the day before yesterday, we need to evaluate if there are any other possible scenarios that would fit the original statement.\n\nIn this case, the only two possibilities are yesterday and the day before yesterday. Since the question does not provide any additional information to narrow down the timeframe, we cannot definitively conclude that the package was delivered the day before yesterday. It could still have been delivered yesterday. Therefore, we cannot infer that the package was delivered the day before based on the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: No."
