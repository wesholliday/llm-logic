If there are other possible explanations for what happened to the flight, then we cannot make this inference. However, if we accept the premise that the flight can only be delayed or on time, then the statement \"The flight must have been delayed or on time\" implies that there are no other options. If there are no other options, and the flight was not delayed, then it must have been on time.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
