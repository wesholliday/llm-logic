            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The concert must have been sold out or postponed\" suggests two possible scenarios: either the concert was sold out, or it was postponed. However, just because one of these scenarios is true, it doesn't necessarily mean the other one is also true. In other words, even if the concert was sold out, it could still have taken place as planned. Therefore, we cannot infer from this statement that the concert must have been postponed. We can only say that it might have been postponed, but we don't have enough information to be sure.\n\nAnswer: No."
