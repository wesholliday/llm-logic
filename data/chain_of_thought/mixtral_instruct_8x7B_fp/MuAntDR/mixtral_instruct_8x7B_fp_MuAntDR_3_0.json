The statement 'The keys must have been on the table' is a separate claim that is not necessarily entailed by the original statement.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the keys were on the table, we would need additional information that rules out the possibility that the keys were in the drawer. Without such information, we cannot definitively conclude that the keys were on the table.\n\nAnswer: No."
