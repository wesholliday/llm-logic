            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that the exam must have been easy from the statement \"The exam must have been difficult or easy,\" we need to consider the meaning of negation in statements. In English, when we say \"X or Y,\" it means that at least one of those statements is true, but it doesn't specify which one. However, if we know that \"not Y\" is true (in this case, \"The exam was not difficult\"), then we can infer that \"X\" must be true (therefore, \"The exam was easy\"). In other words, if an exam cannot be difficult, then it must be easy.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
