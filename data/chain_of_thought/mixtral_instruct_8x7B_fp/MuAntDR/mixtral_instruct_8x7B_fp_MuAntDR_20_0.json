The statement \"The event must have been formal or semi-formal\" means that the event's dress code was either formal or semi-formal, but it doesn't necessarily mean it was one or the other. It's possible that the event was formal, which is a more specific category than semi-formal. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive conclusion that the event was semi-formal based on the given information. Answer: No."
