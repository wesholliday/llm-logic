However, just because one of these conditions must be true, it does not necessarily mean that the more specific condition of \"The document must have been notarized\" is true. The original statement only guarantees that the document has been handled in one of those ways, but it does not specify which one. Therefore, we cannot infer that the document was notarized based on the given information. Answer: No."
