    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a dribbet, a vrendel, and a toffen lead this quarter\u2019s gadston sales. Market analysts expect the dribbet likely will retain the top sales spot, followed by the vrendel, with gadston sales for the toffen significantly lower. These dominate the gadston market currently, so if the vrendel isn\u2019t #1 in sales, then if the dribbet isn\u2019t #1, the toffen will be #1. Moreover, the dribbet likely will lead gadston sales this quarter and hence the vrendel likely won\u2019t lead sales. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the dribbet isn\u2019t #1 in gadston sales this quarter, the toffen will be #1?",

If Vrendel isn't #1, then Toffen will be.\n3. Dribbet is likely to lead in sales, which means Vrendel won't lead in sales.\n\nFrom this information, we can infer that if Dribbet doesn't lead in sales, then Vrendel also can't lead in sales (because Dribbet is expected to lead). And since the only other option, according to the information provided, is Toffen, it follows that if Dribbet isn't #1 in gadston sales this quarter, the toffen will be #1.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
