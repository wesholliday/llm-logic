    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantug, a loperit, and a frallon are shortlisted for Blither of the Year. Industry watchers consider the fantug the front runner, followed by the loperit, while the frallon is a heavy underdog. Since these are the only products in contention, if the loperit doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the fantug doesn\u2019t win, the frallon will win. Moreover, the fantug likely will win the award and hence the loperit likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantug doesn't win Blither of the Year, the frallon will?",

It's also stated that the fantug is more likely to win than the loperit. However, it doesn't provide any information about how likely the frallon is to win if the fantug doesn't. It's possible that the frallon has a very low chance of winning, even if the fantug doesn't win. Without this information, we can't determine if it's likely that the frallon will win if the fantug doesn't.\n\nAnswer: No."
