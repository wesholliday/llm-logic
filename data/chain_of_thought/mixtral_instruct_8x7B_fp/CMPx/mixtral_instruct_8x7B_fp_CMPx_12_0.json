    "user_prompt": "Suppose a stribben, a vanoon, and a jentapp are applying to rent a bondle. The owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant, followed by the vanoon, while the jentapp seems much less qualified to rent a bondle. Since these are the only applicants, if the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, then if the stribben isn\u2019t selected, the jentapp will be selected. Moreover, the stribben likely will be chosen and hence the vanoon likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the stribben isn\u2019t selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: This question involves conditional probabilities and the concept of contradiction. First, we are told that the vanoon is less qualified than the stribben, and if the vanoon isn't selected, then the jentapp will be chosen if the stribben isn't selected. This information sets up a conditional relationship between the stribben being selected and the jentapp being selected when the vanoon is not.\n\nHowever, we are also told that the stribben is likely to be chosen, which implies that the vanoon is unlikely to be chosen. Since the stribben and the vanoon are mutually exclusive (either one or the other will be chosen, but not both), if the vanoon is unlikely to be chosen, then it becomes more likely that the stribben will be chosen.\n\nTherefore, the conditional relationship between the stribben not being selected and the jentapp being selected is less likely to occur, because the stribben is more likely to be chosen in the first place.\n\nAnswer: No, it does not follow that it's likely that, if the stribben isn't selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be. In fact, it's more likely that the stribben will be selected, and the jentapp will not."
