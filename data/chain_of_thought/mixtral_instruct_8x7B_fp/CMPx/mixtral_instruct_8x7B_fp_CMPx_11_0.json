    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trenist, a lanken, and a draloid are shortlisted for Drij of the Year. The trenist is considered the front runner, followed by the lanken, while the draloid is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates in contention, if the lanken doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the trenist doesn\u2019t win it, the draloid will win it. Moreover, the trenist likely will win the award and hence the lanken likely won\u2019t win it. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trenist doesn\u2019t win Drij of the Year, the draloid will?",

            "content": "Explanation: The information given tells us that the trenist is the front runner and the lanken is less likely to win. It also tells us that if the lanken doesn't win, then the draloid will win. The fact that the trenist is likely to win implies that the trenist won't lose (i.e., won't not win). Therefore, it can't be the case that the lanken doesn't win and the trenist doesn't win, because if the lanken doesn't win, then the trenist must not have not won (the trenist must have won). Since the trenist must have won, the draloid can't have won, because there are only three candidates and the trenist and lanken together account for both possible wins. Thus, the draloid is unlikely to win.\n\nAnswer: No."
