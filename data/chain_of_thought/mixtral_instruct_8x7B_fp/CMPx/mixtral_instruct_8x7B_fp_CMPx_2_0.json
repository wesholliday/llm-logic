    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

            "content": "Explanation: This question involves conditional probability, specifically the concept of \"contrapositive\" in logic. The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". In this case, the original statement is \"If the cramen doesn't get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn't, the sulect will\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the sulect will not get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn't get it, the cramen will\".\n\nFrom the information given, we know that the jantiz is the most qualified and is likely to get the zulision, and if the jantiz doesn't get it, then the cramen is likely to get it. Therefore, it's not likely that the sulect will get the zulision if the jantiz doesn't.\n\nAnswer: No."
