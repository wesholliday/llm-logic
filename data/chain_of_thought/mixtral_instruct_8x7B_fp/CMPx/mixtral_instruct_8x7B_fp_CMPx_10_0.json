    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantole, a dribban, and a cruggit are the most downloaded fillip apps this month. Market watchers expect the fantole likely will retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit download rate significantly lower. These lead the downloads, so if the dribban isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn\u2019t, the cruggit will be. Moreover, the fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fantole isn\u2019t the most downloaded, the cruggit will be?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": "Explanation: The information given states that the fantole is expected to retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban, and then the cruggit with a significantly lower download rate. This implies that the fantole has a higher probability of being the most downloaded app, followed by the dribban, and then the cruggit.\n\nIf the fantole isn't the most downloaded app, then the dribban is the most likely to be the most downloaded app, given that it has a higher download rate than the cruggit. The only way for the cruggit to be the most downloaded app is if both the fantole and the dribban have significantly lower download rates than the cruggit, which is unlikely given the information provided.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that if the fantole isn't the most downloaded app, then the dribban will be, rather than the cruggit.\n\nAnswer: No."
