    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a garplex, a beelhet, and a peedonk are competing to be domer of the year. Experts think the garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, with the peedonk having a much lower chance. Since these are the only domer candidates, if the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer. Moreover, it is likely the garplex will become domer and hence the beelhet likely won\u2019t become domer. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will?",

            "content": "Explanation: The information given tells us that the garplex is most likely to win domer of the year, followed closely by the beelhet, and the peedonk has a much lower chance. It also tells us that if the beelhet doesn't become domer and the garplex also doesn't become domer, then the peedonk will become domer. \n\nThe fact that the garplex is likely to become domer and the beelhet is likely not to become domer does not directly give us information about what will happen if the garplex doesn't become domer. It could still be the case that if the garplex doesn't become domer, the beelhet will become domer instead, and the peedonk will not become domer.\n\nHowever, the first statement tells us that if the beelhet doesn't become domer, then the peedonk will become domer, if the garplex doesn't become domer. Given that the garplex is likely to become domer, it is unlikely that the beelhet will become domer. Therefore, it is likely that if the garplex doesn't become domer, then the beelhet also won't become domer, and the peedonk will become domer.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
