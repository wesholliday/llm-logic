    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crastin, a nivet, and a jomial are the top bispets this breeding season. Breeders expect the crastin likely will birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. These lead in birthing, so if the nivet doesn\u2019t birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn\u2019t, the jomial will. Moreover, the crastin likely will lead births and hence the nivet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, the jomial will?",

We are also told that the crastin is expected to birth the most offspring, and the nivet is expected to birth more offspring than the jomial. \n\nLet's consider the possibilities. If the crastin does lead in births, then both the nivet and jomial birth fewer offspring, so the jomial will not lead in births. This is the expected outcome. \n\nNow, let's consider what happens if the crastin does not lead in births. This means that either the nivet or the jomial has more offspring than the crastin. However, we know that if the nivet does not birth the most offspring, then the jomial will. Therefore, if the crastin does not lead in births, it must be because the nivet also did not lead in births, and therefore the jomial must have birthed the most offspring.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
