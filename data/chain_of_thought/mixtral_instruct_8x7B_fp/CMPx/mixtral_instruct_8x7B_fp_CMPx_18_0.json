    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a blimfet, a crongle, and a narzil are the leading bafwidgers. Experts expect the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most this year, followed by the crongle, with the narzil bafwidging much less. These are the only major bafwidgers, so if the crongle doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, then if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most. Moreover, the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most, and hence the crongle likely won\u2019t bafwidge the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will?",

            "content": "Explanation: This question involves conditional logic and probability. The blimfet is expected to bafwidge the most, and the crongle is expected to bafwidge less than the blimfet but more than the narzil. If the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, then either the crongle or the narzil will. However, since the crongle is also expected to bafwidge less than the blimfet, it is more likely that the narzil will bafwidge the most if the blimfet doesn't. Therefore, it is likely that if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, the narzil will.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
