    "user_prompt": "Suppose a fantole, a dribban, and a snorpul have the best odds to win this season's Rizzle Cup. Oddsmakers believe it's most probable the fantole will capture the cup, followed by the dribban, while the snorpul is a heavy longshot. Since these are the only top contenders, if the dribban doesn\u2019t win the cup, then if the fantole doesn\u2019t win, the snorpul will win. Moreover, the fantole likely will win the cup and hence the dribban likely won't win. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will?",

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": "Explanation:  The information given tells us that there are three possible winners of the Rizzle Cup: the fantole, the dribban, and the snorpul. It is most probable that the fantole will win, followed by the dribban, and the snorpul is the least likely to win. We are asked to determine if it is likely that, if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will.\n\nGiven that the fantole is the most likely to win, it means that the dribban and the snorpul are both less likely to win. If the dribban doesn't win, then either the fantole or the snorpul will win. However, since the fantole is more likely to win than the snorpul, it is still more likely that if the fantole doesn't win, the dribban will have lost to the fantole, rather than the snorpul.\n\nTherefore, it does not follow that it is likely that if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will.\n\nAnswer: No."
