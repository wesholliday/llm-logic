    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a tropin, a loment, and a dralid are the top scoring vilcants this season. Experts expect the tropin likely will have the highest vilcant rate, followed by the loment, with the dralid significantly lower. These lead the vilcants, so if the loment doesn\u2019t have the top vilcant rate, then if the tropin doesn\u2019t, the dralid will. Moreover, the tropin likely will lead in vilcants and hence the loment likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the tropin doesn\u2019t lead in vilcants, the dralid will?",

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": "Explanation: First, we need to understand that the tropin is expected to have the highest vilcant rate, followed by the loment, and then the dralid. The passage also states that if the loment doesn't have the top vilcant rate, then the dralid will. Additionally, the tropin is expected to lead in vilcants, and if this is the case, then the loment will not lead. Therefore, if the tropin doesn't lead in vilcants, then the only two possibilities are the loment and the dralid. However, since the loment is not expected to have the highest vilcant rate, it is likely that the dralid will have the highest rate of the three if the tropin does not.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
