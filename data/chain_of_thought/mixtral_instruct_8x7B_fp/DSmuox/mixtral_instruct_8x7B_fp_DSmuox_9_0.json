The second statement \"Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked\" presents two possibilities: either the twonk is varnished, or it must be plinked.\n\nGiven that the first statement tells us that plinking the twonk is not required, it follows that the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the twonk is varnished. If the twonk didn't have to be plinked and it also wasn't varnished, then there would be no justification for plinking it, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can indeed infer that 'The twonk is varnished'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
