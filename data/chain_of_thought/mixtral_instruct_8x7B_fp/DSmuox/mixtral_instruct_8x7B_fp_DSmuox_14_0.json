The second statement \"Either the clug is fleeked or it must be snugged\" presents two possibilities: either the clug is fleeked or it must be snugged. Given that we know from the first statement that it is not necessary for the clug to be snugged, it follows that the first possibility (the clug being fleeked) must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
