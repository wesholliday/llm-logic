In this case, the two parts are \"The sneg is crampled\" and \"it must be sproted\".\n\nSince we know from the first statement that it's possible that the sneg is not sproted, it means that the second part of the second statement, \"it must be sproted\", is false.\n\nTherefore, since at least one part of the disjunction in the second statement must be true, and we've determined that the second part is false, it must be the case that the first part, \"The sneg is crampled\", is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
