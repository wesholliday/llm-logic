            "content": "Explanation:  The first statement \"It's not the case that the wug must be garbled\" means that it's possible for the wug to not be garbled. The second statement \"Either the wug is sproinged or it must be garbled\" presents two possibilities: either the wug is sproinged, or it must be garbled. \n\nGiven these two statements, it is indeed possible to infer that \"The wug is sproinged\". This is because the second statement presents the only two possibilities for the wug's state, and the negation of the second part of that statement (the \"must be garbled\" part) is provided in the first statement. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that \"The wug is sproinged\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
