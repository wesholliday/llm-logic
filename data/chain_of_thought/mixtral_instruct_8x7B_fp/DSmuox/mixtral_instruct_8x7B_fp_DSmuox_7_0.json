The second statement, \"Either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked,\" presents two possibilities: either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked. Since we know from the first statement that it is possible for the whiffle not to be tinked, this means that the second statement reduces to \"Either the whiffle is shanked.\" Therefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
