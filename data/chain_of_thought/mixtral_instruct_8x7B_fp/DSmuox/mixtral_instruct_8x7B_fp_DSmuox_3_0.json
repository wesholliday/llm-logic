The splat is morphed.\n2. The splat must be quanked.\n\nAccording to the first statement, \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked,\" we know that the second scenario is not necessarily true. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the first scenario is true. It only means that the second scenario is false.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The splat is morphed.'\n\nAnswer: No."
