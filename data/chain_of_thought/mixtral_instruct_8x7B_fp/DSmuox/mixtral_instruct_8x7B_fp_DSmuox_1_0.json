The second statement \"Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled\" presents two possibilities: either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled. Since we know from the first statement that the flugel does not have to be zargled, it must be the case that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
