The second statement \"Either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped\" presents two possibilities: either the smip is shripped or it is necessary for the smip to be lupped. Since we know from the first statement that it is not necessary for the smip to be lupped, the only remaining possibility is that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
