If it's possible for the shank not to be nugged (first statement), then the second part of the second statement (\"it must be nugged\") cannot be true. Therefore, the first part of the second statement (\"the shank is plooked\") must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that \"The shank is plooked\" based on the given statements."
