This implies that the flug can be in a state where it is not required to be zimmed.\n\nThe second statement \"Either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed\" presents two possibilities for the flug's state. It is blummed or it must be zimmed.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the flug does not have to be zimmed, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
