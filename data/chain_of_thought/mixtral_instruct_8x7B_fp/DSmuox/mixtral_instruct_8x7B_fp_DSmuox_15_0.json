Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened (we can denote this as D is vroombed \u2228 (D must be spened))\n\nTo infer that \"The dreb is vroombed\" (D is vroombed), we need to show that the second statement is true and that it cannot be the case that \"D must be spened\".\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that \u00ac(D must be spened) is true. This means that it is not necessary for the dreb to be spened.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement: D is vroombed \u2228 (D must be spened). Since we already know that \u00ac(D must be spened) is true, the second statement simplifies to D is vroombed \u2228 False, which further simplifies to just D is vroombed.\n\nSince the simplified second statement (D is vroombed) does not contradict the first statement (\u00ac(D must be spened)), we can indeed infer that \"The dreb is vroombed\".\n\nAnswer: Yes"
