If the smonk is not required to be plagged, then the second part of the second statement, \"it must be plagged\", cannot be true. Therefore, for the whole second statement to be true, the first part, \"the smonk is vreebled\", must be true.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer that 'The smonk is vreebled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
