The second statement \"Either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged\" is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two parts must be true.\n\nIf the first part of the second statement is true, then the glip is slogged. However, we cannot infer this just from the given information. The fact that it's not necessary for the glip to be tragged doesn't mean it can't be tragged. It could still be the case that the glip is not slogged and must be tragged, which would make the first part of the second statement false but still consistent with the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No."
