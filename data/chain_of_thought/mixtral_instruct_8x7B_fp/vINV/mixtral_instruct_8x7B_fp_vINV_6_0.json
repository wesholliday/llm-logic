            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"if P, then Q\" is \"if not Q, then not P\". If the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true and vice versa. \n\nIn this case, the premise is \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\", which can be written as \"if Sue chose pizza (P), then Bob chose pasta (Q)\". Its contrapositive would be \"if Bob did not choose pasta (not Q), then Sue did not choose pizza (not P)\". \n\nSince the conclusion matches the contrapositive of the given premise, and the truth of a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
