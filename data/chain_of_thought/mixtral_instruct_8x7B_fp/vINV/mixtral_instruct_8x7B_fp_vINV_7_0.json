            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive. A contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion of the original conditional statement and then reversing the order. If the original statement is logically valid, then its contrapositive is also logically valid. \n\nIn this case, the original statement is 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race'. Its contrapositive is 'If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race'. \n\nSince this is a contrapositive of the original statement, and the original statement is logically valid if and only if its contrapositive is logically valid, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
