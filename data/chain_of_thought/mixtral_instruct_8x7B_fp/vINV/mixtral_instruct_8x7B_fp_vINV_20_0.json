            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive. A contrapositive is created by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion of the original conditional statement and then reversing the order. If the original statement is logically valid, then its contrapositive is also logically valid. \n\nIn this case, the original statement is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'. Its contrapositive is 'If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red'. However, the argument presented is 'If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow', which is equivalent to the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nSince the argument is the contrapositive of the original statement, and the original statement is logically valid, the argument is also logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
