            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'if P, then Q' is 'if not Q, then not P'. It is a logically equivalent form of the original statement. In this case, the premise 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' can be restated as 'If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding'. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
