            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive. A contrapositive is created by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion of the original conditional statement, and then switching the order. In this case, the original conditional statement is 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake', and its contrapositive is 'If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake'. Since the contrapositive has the same truth value as the original statement, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa. Therefore, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
