            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'if P, then Q' is 'if not Q, then not P'. The contrapositive of an argument is logically equivalent to the original argument. \n\nIn this case, the premise is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt', which can be written as 'P -> Q'. The conclusion is 'If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt', which can be written as 'not P -> not Q'. This is exactly the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
