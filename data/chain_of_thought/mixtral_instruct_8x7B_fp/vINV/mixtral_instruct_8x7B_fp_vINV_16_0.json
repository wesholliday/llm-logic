            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive. A contrapositive is created by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion of the original conditional statement and then reversing the order. If the original statement is logically valid, then its contrapositive is also logically valid. \n\nIn this case, the original statement is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'. Its contrapositive is 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton'. The given argument 'If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim' is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nSince the argument is a contrapositive of a logically valid statement, it is also logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
