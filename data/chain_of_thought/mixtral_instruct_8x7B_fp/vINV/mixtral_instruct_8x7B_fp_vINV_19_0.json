The original statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball,\" and its contrapositive is \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\" However, the given argument is the inverse of the original statement, which is \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\" The inverse and the original statement do not share the same truth value, so the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No."
