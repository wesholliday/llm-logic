            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is logically valid, and it is an example of the transposition rule in logic. The transposition rule states that if a conditional statement \"if P then Q\" is true, then its contrapositive statement \"if not Q then not P\" is also true. In this case, the original statement is \"if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal,\" which can be restated as \"P implies Q.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"if the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic,\" which can be restated as \"not Q implies not P.\" However, the conclusion of the argument is \"if the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal,\" which is the contrapositive of the original statement. Since the contrapositive of a true statement is also true, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
