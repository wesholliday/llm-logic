            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive. A contrapositive is formed by negating the hypothesis and conclusion of the original conditional statement and then swapping them. If the original statement is logically true, then its contrapositive is also logically true. In this case, the original statement is 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad', and its contrapositive is 'If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad'. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
