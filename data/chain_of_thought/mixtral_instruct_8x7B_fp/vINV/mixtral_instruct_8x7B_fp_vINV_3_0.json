            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive reasoning, which is a valid form of logical argument. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'if P, then Q' is 'if not Q, then not P'. In this case, the premise 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' can be restated as 'if the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James', which is the conclusion of the argument. Since the argument follows the form of contrapositive reasoning, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
