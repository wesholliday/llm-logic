            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is logically valid, and it is an example of a logical rule called transposition. Transposition states that if a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is true, then its contrapositive statement \"If not Q, then not P\" is also true. In this case, the premise \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" can be restated as \"If Sam took a plane (P), then Erin took a train (Q)\". The conclusion \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train\" can be restated as \"If not P, then not Q\", which is the contrapositive of the original premise. Since the original premise is true, its contrapositive must also be true, making the argument valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
