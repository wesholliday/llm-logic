The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In this case, the premise \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" can be rewritten as \"If not (the robot visited Jupiter), then not (the alien visited Mars),\" which is equivalent to the conclusion \"If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes."
