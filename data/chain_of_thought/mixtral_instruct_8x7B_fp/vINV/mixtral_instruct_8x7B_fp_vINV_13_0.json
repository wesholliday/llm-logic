The argument can be rephrased as follows:\n\nPremise: If A, then B\nConclusion: If not A, then not B\n\nThis is a valid argument because if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true. If it is true that if the car was red, then the truck was blue, then it follows that if the car was not red, then the truck could not have been blue. This is because the only way for the truck to be blue is if the car is red, so if the car is not red, then the truck cannot be blue.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
