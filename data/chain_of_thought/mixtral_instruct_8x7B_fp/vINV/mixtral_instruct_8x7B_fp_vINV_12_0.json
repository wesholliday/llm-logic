            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'if P, then Q' is 'if not Q, then not P'. If the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa. In this case, the premise 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' can be restated as 'if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo', which is the conclusion of the argument. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
