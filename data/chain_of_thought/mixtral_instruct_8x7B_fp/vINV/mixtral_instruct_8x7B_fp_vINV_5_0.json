            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive, which is a logically equivalent form of a conditional statement. The original statement is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\". Its contrapositive is \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\". However, the given argument is in the form of \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis\", which is the inverse of the original statement, not the contrapositive. The inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No."
