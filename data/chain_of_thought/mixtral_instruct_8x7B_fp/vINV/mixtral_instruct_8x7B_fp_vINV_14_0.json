            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'if P, then Q' is 'if not Q, then not P'. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In this case, the premise 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den' can be restated as 'if the bear is not in the den (which is the contrapositive of 'if the bear was in the cave'), then the wolf is not in the den'. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
