A contrapositive is created by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion of the original conditional statement and then reversing the order. If the original statement is logically valid, then its contrapositive is also logically valid. \n\nIn this case, the original statement is 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry'. Its contrapositive is 'If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate'. The given argument 'If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry' is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nSince the argument is a contrapositive of a logically valid statement, it is also logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
