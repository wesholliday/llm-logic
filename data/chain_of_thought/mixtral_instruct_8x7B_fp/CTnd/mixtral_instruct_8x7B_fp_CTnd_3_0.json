This statement tells us that if the condition P (ate a meal) is true, then the consequence Q (ate a large meal) is false.\n\nThe statement we want to infer is \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal\", which is in the form \"if Q, then not P\". This statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The original statement only tells us about the situation when the person ate a meal but not a large one, it doesn't tell us anything about what happens when the person eats a large meal.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that if the person ate a large meal, then they did not eat a meal.\n\nAnswer: No."
