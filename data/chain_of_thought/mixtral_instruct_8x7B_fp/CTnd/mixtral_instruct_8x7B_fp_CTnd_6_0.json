The negation of the hypothesis is \"the clothes were not washed\", and the negation of the conclusion is \"they were washed properly\". \n\nSo, the negated form of the original statement is \"If the clothes were not washed, then they were washed properly\". \n\nThis is logically equivalent to \"If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed\". \n\nThis is because these two statements have opposite conclusions given the same hypothesis. \n\nAnswer: Yes"
