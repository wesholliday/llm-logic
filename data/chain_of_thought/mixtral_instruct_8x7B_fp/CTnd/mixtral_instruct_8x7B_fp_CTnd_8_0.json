This means that even if the condition (the issue was addressed) is true, the outcome (it was not addressed effectively) is still true. \n\nHowever, the proposed statement \"If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed\" is a contradiction because it suggests that the issue cannot be addressed effectively if it was addressed at all. This is illogical because being addressed and being addressed effectively are not mutually exclusive.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is no.\n\nAnswer: No."
