This statement is logically equivalent to 'If the customer was not greeted warmly, then they were greeted'.\n\nThe proposed statement 'If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted' is in the form of 'if P, then not P'. This is a logical fallacy known as negation introduction, which is not generally valid.\n\nAnswer: No."
