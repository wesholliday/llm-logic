            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables' is in the form of a conditional statement, where the condition (going to the store) leads to the result (not buying vegetables). To determine if the inferred statement 'If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store' is valid, we need to examine the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe original statement implies that the only way to not buy vegetables is by not going to the store. Therefore, if someone did buy vegetables, they must have gone to the store. This contradicts the inferred statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
