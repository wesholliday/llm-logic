This is a form of contrapositive of \"Customer was served promptly\" -> \"He was served\". However, the contrapositive of a statement is not equivalent to its inverse. In the inverse, the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement are swapped, but their truth values are not necessarily preserved. In this case, the original statement implies that the customer was served, but the inferred statement asserts that the customer was not served. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served\".\n\nAnswer: No."
