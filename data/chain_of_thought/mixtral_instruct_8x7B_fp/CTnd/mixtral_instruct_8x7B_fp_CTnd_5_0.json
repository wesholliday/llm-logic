This means that the condition stated (that the room was cleaned) is assumed to be false. The consequence of this false condition is that the room was not cleaned thoroughly. \n\nHowever, the statement we are asked to infer from this is \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned.\" This statement has a true antecedent (that the room was cleaned thoroughly) but a false consequence (that it was not cleaned). \n\nThese two statements have opposite antecedents and opposite consequents, so they cannot be logically inferred from one another. \n\nAnswer: No."
