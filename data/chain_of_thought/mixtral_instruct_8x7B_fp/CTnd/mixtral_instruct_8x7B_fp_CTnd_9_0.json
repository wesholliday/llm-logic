This statement is negating the situation where instructions are given and explained clearly. \n\nNow, the proposed statement is \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given\", which is in the form of \"If Q, then not P\". This is a different scenario from the original statement. \n\nEven though both statements have negations in them, they are negating different parts of the process (one is negating the clarity of explanation and the other is negating the existence of instructions). Therefore, we cannot infer the proposed statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: No."
