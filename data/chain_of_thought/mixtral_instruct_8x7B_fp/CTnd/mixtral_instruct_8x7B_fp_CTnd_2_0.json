It can be formally written as \"Ann exercised (P) -> She did not exercise strenuously (Q)\". \n\nThe statement we want to infer is \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise\", which is \"She exercised strenuously (Q) -> Ann did not exercise (P)\". \n\nHowever, the given statement \"Ann exercised -> She did not exercise strenuously\" does not allow us to infer \"She exercised strenuously -> Ann did not exercise\". These two statements are not logically equivalent. The original statement tells us that if Ann exercised at all, then she did not exercise strenuously. It does not tell us anything about what happens if she did exercise strenuously.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that if Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise.\n\nAnswer: No."
