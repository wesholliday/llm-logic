            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly\" is a contrapositive of \"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied\". This is because the negation of \"the room was tidied thoroughly\" is \"the room was not tidied thoroughly\", and the negation of \"the room was tidied\" is \"the room was not tidied\". Therefore, the given statement is equivalent to \"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied\".\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is a logically equivalent statement, not the original statement that we would infer from. The original statement implies that the room cannot be both tidied and tidied thoroughly, which is different from the logically equivalent statement that if the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied.\n\nTherefore, while we can infer a logically equivalent statement, we cannot infer the original statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
