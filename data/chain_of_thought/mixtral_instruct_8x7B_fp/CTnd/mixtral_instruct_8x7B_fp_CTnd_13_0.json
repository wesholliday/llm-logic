This is because both statements express the idea that no matter how much Alex exercised, it's considered as not exercising. \n\nThe first statement \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much\" implies that even if Alex did some exercise, it was not a significant amount. This can be restated as \"If Alex exercised much (which we know he didn't), then he still did not exercise (because what he did was not significant)\".\n\nAnswer: Yes"
