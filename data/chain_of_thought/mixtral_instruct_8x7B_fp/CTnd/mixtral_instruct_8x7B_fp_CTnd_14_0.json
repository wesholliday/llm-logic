However, this is not what was asked. The statement we are asked about is \"If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared\". This is the converse of the original statement, not the negation.\n\nThe converse of a conditional statement switches the hypothesis and the conclusion. In this case, the hypothesis \"the meal was prepared\" becomes \"the meal was prepared carefully\", and the conclusion \"it was not prepared carefully\" becomes \"it was prepared\".\n\nSince the original statement is a conditional statement, its converse is not necessarily true. In fact, in this case, the converse is not true, because the original statement states that if the meal was prepared, then it was not prepared carefully, but it does not state anything about what happens if the meal was prepared carefully.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
