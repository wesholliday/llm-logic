This is because the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement are negated in the contrapositive statement. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nIn this case, the original statement is not necessarily true, as it's possible for an issue to be discussed in depth without implying that it wasn't discussed at all. Therefore, its contrapositive statement \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed\" is also not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No."
