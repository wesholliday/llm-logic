            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If the job was completed, then it was not completed well\" is a contrapositive of \"If the job was completed well, then it was not completed\". This is because the negation of \"the job was completed well\" is \"the job was not completed well\", and the negation of \"the job was completed\" is \"the job was not completed\". Therefore, the given statement is equivalent to \"If the job was completed well, then it was not completed\". However, this is a logical fallacy known as denying the antecedent, which does not preserve the truth value of the original conditional statement. So while the two statements are logically equivalent in form, we cannot validly infer one from the other.\n\nAnswer: No."
