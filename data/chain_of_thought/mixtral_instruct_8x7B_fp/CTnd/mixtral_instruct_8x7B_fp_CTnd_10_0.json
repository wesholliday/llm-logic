The contrapositive of a statement (A -> B) is (~B -> ~A). If the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nSo, let's find the contrapositive of (A -> ~H):\n\n(~~H -> ~A)\n\nSince \"~~H\" simplifies to \"H\", the contrapositive is:\n\n(H -> ~A)\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement (A -> ~H), we can infer its contrapositive (H -> ~A).\n\nAnswer: Yes"
