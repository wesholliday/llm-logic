The truth of the original statement does not necessarily imply the truth of the inferred statement, because the original statement only tells us about situations where directions were provided but not explained clearly, not about situations where directions were explained clearly but not provided.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided\" based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no."
