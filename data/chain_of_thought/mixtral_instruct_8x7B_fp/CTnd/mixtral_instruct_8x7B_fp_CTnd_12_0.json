This can be rewritten as \"Jane studied if and only if Jane studied for a medium or short amount of time\". \n\nThe statement we want to infer is \"If Jane studied long, then she did not study\". This is logically equivalent to \"Jane studied long \u2194 Jane did not study\". \n\nThese two statements are not equivalent, as shown by a counterexample: if Jane studied for a long time, then the first statement is false, but the second statement is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: No."
