If the splat was not morphed, then the first statement \"it's not the case that the splat must have quanked\" is consistent with this scenario, as it simply means the splat did not quank.\n\n2. However, if the splat was morphed, then the second statement \"if the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked\" implies that the splat did quank. This contradicts the first statement, which denies that the splat must have quanked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it is reasonable to infer that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
