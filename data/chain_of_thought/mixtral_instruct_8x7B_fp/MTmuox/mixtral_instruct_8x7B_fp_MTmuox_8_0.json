            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled\" means that it is possible that the sprocket was not daggled. From this, we cannot directly infer that the sprocket was not cranked. However, the second statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled\" provides additional information. This statement is in the form of a conditional statement, where the condition is \"the sprocket was cranked.\" The consequence of this condition is \"the sprocket must have been daggled.\"\n\nFrom this conditional statement, we can infer that if the sprocket was cranked, then it would have been daggled. But since we know from the first statement that it is possible that the sprocket was not daggled, it follows that the sprocket could not have been cranked. This is because if the sprocket was cranked, it would have been daggled, but we know that it is possible that the sprocket was not daggled, so it cannot be the case that the sprocket was cranked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can indeed infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
