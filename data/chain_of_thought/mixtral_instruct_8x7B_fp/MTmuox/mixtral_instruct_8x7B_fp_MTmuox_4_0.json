However, this statement does not necessarily mean that the fribble was actually snurgled.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that since it's possible that the fribble did not crink, and if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked, it follows that the fribble cannot be both snurgled and not have crinked. Therefore, if it's possible that the fribble did not crink, then the fribble cannot have been snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
