If (Smonk was vreebled) then (Smonk must have plagged)\n\nTo infer 'The smonk was not vreebled', we need to show that the truth of the second statement implies the falsity of the first statement. However, the given first statement is in the form of a negation, which means it asserts the falsity of the statement 'Smonk must have plagged'.\n\nGiven the second statement, if the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk would not plag, which is consistent with the first statement. However, if the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nTherefore, the given statements do allow us to infer that 'The smonk was not vreebled', because this conclusion is consistent with the first statement and contradicts the negation of the second statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
