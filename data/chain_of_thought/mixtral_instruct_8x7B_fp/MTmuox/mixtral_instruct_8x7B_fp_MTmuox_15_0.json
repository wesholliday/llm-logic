The second statement provides a conditional: \"if the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"the dreb was not vroombed,\" we need to consider whether the given information contradicts the possibility of the dreb being vroombed.\n\nThe fact that the dreb may not have been spent does not necessarily mean that it was not vroombed. However, the information provided does not give us any reason to believe that the dreb was vroombed.\n\nTherefore, while we cannot definitively infer that the dreb was not vroombed, we also cannot rule out that possibility based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No."
