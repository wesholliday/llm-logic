If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged (let's denote this as P -> Q)\n\nNow, let's analyze these statements. \n\nThe first statement ~P means that it is not necessary that the glip tragged. This could be true if the glip was not slogged or if the glip was slogged but did not trag.\n\nThe second statement P -> Q is a conditional statement, which means that if the glip was slogged (P), then it must have tragged (Q).\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot directly infer that the glip was not slogged. This is because even if the glip was slogged, it could still be true that it did not trag.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the only way for the glip to trag is by being slogged, then the second statement becomes an equivalence: P <-> Q, which means that the glip was slogged if and only if it tragged.\n\nIn this case, since we know that it's not necessary that the glip tragged (~P), it follows that the glip was not slogged (~P).\n\nAnswer: Yes, if we assume that the only way for the glip to trag is by being slogged, then from the given statements, we can infer that the glip was not slogged."
