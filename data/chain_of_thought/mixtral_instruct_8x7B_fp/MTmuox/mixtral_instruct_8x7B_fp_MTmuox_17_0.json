However, the first statement is a negation of the claim that the flob must have movated.\n\nIf the flob was skizzled, then it would have movated, but the first statement tells us that it's not the case that the flob must have movated. This implies that the flob could have not movated, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nTherefore, the flob cannot be skizzled, because if it were, it would have movated, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
