However, this does not necessarily mean that every nugging of the shank is caused by plooking.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot infer that the shank was not plooked. This is because even if it's possible for the shank to not be nugged, the shank could still have been plooked and then nugged by some other means. Therefore, the given statements do not provide enough information to conclude that the shank was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: No."
