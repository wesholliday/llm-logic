This doesn't necessarily mean that the grommet didn't plop the frink, but only that it's possible.\n\nSecond, \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink\" means that if the grommet was sploffed, then we can be sure that the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nHowever, the given information does not provide any direct link between the grommet being not required to plop the frink and the grommet being sploffed or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The grommet was not sploffed\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No."
