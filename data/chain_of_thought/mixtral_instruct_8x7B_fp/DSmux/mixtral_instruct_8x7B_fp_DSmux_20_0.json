Either the fleeg is bluttered (p) or it must be surned (q). This is a disjunction.\n2. It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned (not q). This is a negation.\n\nNow, let's analyze this step by step:\n- If it's not the case that the fleeg must be surned, then we can conclude that the fleeg is not required to be surned (not q).\n- Going back to our original disjunction, if the fleeg is not required to be surned, then the only thing left to consider is whether the fleeg is bluttered (p).\n- Therefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that 'The fleeg is bluttered' (p).\n\nAnswer: Yes"
