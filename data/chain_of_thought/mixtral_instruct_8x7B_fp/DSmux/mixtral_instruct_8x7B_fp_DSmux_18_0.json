Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, we have the statement \"Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged.\" This can be represented as P v N, where P stands for \"the shank is plooked\" and N stands for \"it must be nugged.\"\n\nNext, we have \"It's not the case that the shank must be nugged.\" This is the negation of statement N, represented as ~N.\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"The shank is plooked\" (P) from these two statements.\n\nGiven that P v N is true, and ~N is also true, then P must be true. This is because if N were false, and P or N must be true, the only way for this to hold is for P to be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
