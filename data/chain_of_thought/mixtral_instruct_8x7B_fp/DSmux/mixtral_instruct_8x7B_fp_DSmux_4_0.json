Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked. This can be broken down into two possibilities: a) The fribble is snurgled, or b) The fribble must be crinked.\n2. It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked. In other words, it's possible that the fribble is not crinkled.\n\nNow, let's analyze these statements. If it's possible that the fribble is not crinkled, then according to the first statement, the only remaining possibility is that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
