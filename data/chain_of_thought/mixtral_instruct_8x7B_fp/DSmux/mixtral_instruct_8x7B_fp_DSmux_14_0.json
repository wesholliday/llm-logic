Either the clug is fleeked or it must be snugged (this is a disjunction).\n2. It's not the case that the clug must be snugged (this is a negation).\n\nNow, let's analyze this step by step:\n- If it's not the case that the clug must be snugged, then the opposite of \"it must be snugged\" must be true. The opposite of \"it must be snugged\" is \"it does not have to be snugged\" or \"it can't be snugged.\"\n- Going back to our original disjunction, if \"it can't be snugged,\" then the only option left for the clug is to be \"fleeked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes"
