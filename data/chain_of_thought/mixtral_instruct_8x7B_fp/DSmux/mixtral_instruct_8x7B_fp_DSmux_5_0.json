Either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled.\n2. It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled.\n\nThe first statement is a disjunction, meaning it states that either one condition or another is true. In this case, the conditions are \"the zinger is fraggled\" and \"it must be smoogled.\"\n\nThe second statement negates the second condition of the first statement, meaning that it is not necessary for the zinger to be smoogled.\n\nSince the second condition is negated, and the first statement only provides two possible conditions, if the second condition is not true, then the first condition must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
