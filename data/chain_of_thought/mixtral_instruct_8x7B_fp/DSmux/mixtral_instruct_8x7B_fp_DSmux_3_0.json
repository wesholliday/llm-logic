            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked\" is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two component statements must be true. The second statement is the negation of \"the splat must be quanked\", which means that the second statement is equivalent to \"it is not necessary that the splat is quanked\" or \"it is possible that the splat is not quanked\". Taken together, these two statements imply that if the splat is not necessarily quanked, then it must be morphed. This is because the disjunction requires at least one of the two component statements to be true, and the second statement tells us that the second component is not necessarily true, so the first component must be true. Therefore, we can infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
