In order to infer that 'The grommet is sploffed', we need to have enough information to conclude that it is necessarily true.\n\nWe are given the statement 'Either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped', which can be broken down into two possible scenarios:\n1. The grommet is sploffed\n2. The grommet must be plopped\n\nWe are also given the statement 'It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped', which negates the second scenario.\n\nSince we have only one scenario left, and we know that it is the only possible scenario based on the given information, we can infer that 'The grommet is sploffed'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
