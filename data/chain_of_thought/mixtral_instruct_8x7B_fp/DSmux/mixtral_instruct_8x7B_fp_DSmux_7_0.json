The second statement is the negation of \"It must be tinked,\" which means \"It is not necessary that the whiffle is tinked\" or \"The whiffle may not be tinked.\" \n\nGiven that the whiffle may not be tinked, it is possible that the first statement \"The whiffle is shanked\" is true. Since one of the disjuncts must be true, and the second disjunct is possibly false, we can infer that the first disjunct \"The whiffle is shanked\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
