The second statement \"It's not the case that the dreb must be spened\" is negating the second part of the first statement, implying that the first part of the first statement \"the dreb is vroombed\" must be true. Therefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that 'The dreb is vroombed'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
