In everyday language, \"either A or B\" means that at least one of the two statements A and B must be true. \"It's not the case that A\" means that A is false. \n\nGiven \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled\", if it's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled (meaning it's possible for the sprocket not to be daggled), then the only option left from the original statement is that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
