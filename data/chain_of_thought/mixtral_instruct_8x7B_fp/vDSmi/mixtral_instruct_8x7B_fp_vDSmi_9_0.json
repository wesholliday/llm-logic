A disjunctive syllogism argument has the form:\n\nPremise 1: P or Q\nPremise 2: Not-P\nConclusion: Q\n\nIn this case, the first premise asserts that the missing puzzle piece is either in the box (P) or blending in on the floor (Q). The second premise suggests that the missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor (not-Q). Therefore, by the rules of disjunctive syllogism, we can conclude that the missing puzzle piece is in the box (P).\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
