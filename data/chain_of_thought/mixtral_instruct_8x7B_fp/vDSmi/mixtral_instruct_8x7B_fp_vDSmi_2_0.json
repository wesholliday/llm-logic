            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is a disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. A disjunctive syllogism has the form:\n\nP1: P or Q\nP2: Not-P\nC: Q\n\nIn this case, the first premise (P1) is 'Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table' (P or Q). The second premise (P2) is 'The book might not be resting on the table' (Not-P). The conclusion (C) is 'The book is on the shelf' (Q).\n\nThe validity of this argument lies in the fact that if one disjunct (P or Q) is false, then the other disjunct must be true. In this case, if the book is not resting on the table (P2), then it must be on the shelf (C).\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
