            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called Disjunctive Syllogism, where the argument has two premises, one of which is a disjunction (or an 'or' statement), and the other being the negation of one of the disjuncts. In this case, the first premise 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' is the disjunction, and the second premise 'Fido might not be in the garden' negates the second disjunct. Therefore, if the second premise is true, then the first premise implies that Fido must be inside. Thus, the conclusion 'Fido is inside' logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
