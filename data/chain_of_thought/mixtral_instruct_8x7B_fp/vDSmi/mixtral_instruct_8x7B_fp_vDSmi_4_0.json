A disjunctive syllogism has the form:\n\nP1: P or Q\nP2: Not-Q\nC: Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, the first premise 'Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom' can be broken down into 'the cat is napping on the couch' (P) or 'the cat is playing in the bedroom' (Q). The second premise 'The cat might not be playing in the bedroom' can be interpreted as 'it is not the case that the cat is playing in the bedroom' (Not-Q). The conclusion 'The cat is napping on the couch' is equivalent to 'the cat is napping on the couch' (P).\n\nTherefore, the argument follows the form of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid form of argument.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
