A disjunctive syllogism has the form:\n\nPremise 1: P or Q\nPremise 2: Not Q\nConclusion: Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, the first premise asserts that either the shoes are in the closet (P) or they must be lined up by the door (Q). The second premise denies that the shoes are lined up by the door (not Q). Therefore, the conclusion asserts that the shoes must be in the closet (P).\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
