A disjunctive syllogism has the form:\n\nPremise 1: P or Q\nPremise 2: Not-P\nConclusion: Q\n\nIn this case, the first premise asserts that the toy is either in the toy box (P) or on the shelf (Q). The second premise suggests that the toy might not be on the shelf (Not-Q). Therefore, the conclusion follows that the toy must be in the toy box (P).\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
