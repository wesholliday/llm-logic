A disjunctive syllogism has the form:\n\nPremise 1: P or Q\nPremise 2: Not Q\nConclusion: Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, the first premise asserts that either the cookies are in the jar (P) or they are hidden in the pantry (Q). The second premise suggests that the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry (not Q). Therefore, by the rules of disjunctive syllogism, we can conclude that the cookies must be in the jar (P).\n\nAnswer: Yes, the form of argument is logically valid."
