A disjunctive syllogism argument has the form:\n\nPremise 1: P or Q\nPremise 2: Not-P\nConclusion: Q\n\nIn this case, the first premise asserts that either the scarf is in the backpack (P) or it is on the coat rack (Q). The second premise asserts that the scarf might not be on the coat rack (Not-Q). Therefore, by the rules of disjunctive syllogism, we can conclude that the scarf must be in the backpack (P).\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
