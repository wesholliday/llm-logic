In Modus Ponens, if we have a conditional statement (P -> Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true. \n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter'. The antecedent, 'The alien visited Mars', is not given. Instead, we are given the second statement, 'The robot visited Jupiter'. \n\nTo determine if 'The alien visited Mars' is true, we need to apply Modus Ponens. However, we only have half of the information needed. We cannot determine if 'The alien visited Mars' is true based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No."
