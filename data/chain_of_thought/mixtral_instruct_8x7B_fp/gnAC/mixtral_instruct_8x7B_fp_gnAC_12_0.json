            "content": "Explanation: This question is asking about logical implication, specifically using the concept of conditional statements. In the statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo,\" Joe's action is the condition for Lucy's action. This is also known as a material conditional in logic.\n\nThe statement \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is given as true. However, even if the consequence (Lucy went to the zoo) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the condition (Joe went to the park) is also true. This is because there could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo, not related to Joe going to the park.\n\nAnswer: No."
