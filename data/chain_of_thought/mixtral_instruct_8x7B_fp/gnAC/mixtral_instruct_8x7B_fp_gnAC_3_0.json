The statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement.  The part before the 'then' is the hypothesis, and the part after the 'then' is the conclusion. \n\nThe truth of this statement does not require that James wrote every mystery novel, only that if a book is written by James, it is a mystery novel. \n\nThe second statement is 'The book is a mystery novel'. This is the conclusion of our conditional statement. \n\nHowever, just because the conclusion is true, it does not necessarily mean that the hypothesis is true. It could be that the book is a mystery novel for some other reason. \n\nAnswer: No."
