            "content": "Explanation: This is a logical reasoning question that involves evaluating a conditional statement and applying it to given circumstances. The conditional statement is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'. This can be represented as Mary \u2192 Sue. The given facts are 'Sue was at the wedding' (Sue) and the conditional statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' (Mary \u2192 Sue). \n\nTo determine if 'Mary was at the wedding' is true, we can use the concept of logical contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. The truth of a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nThe contrapositive of Mary \u2192 Sue is not Sue \u2192 not Mary. Given that Sue is true, the negation not Sue is false. Therefore, not Sue \u2192 not Mary is vacuously true, meaning it doesn't provide any useful information about the truth value of Mary.\n\nHowever, we can also use logical deduction to determine the truth value of Mary. Since Sue was at the wedding, and if Mary was at the wedding then Sue was at the wedding, it follows that Mary must have been at the wedding as well.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
