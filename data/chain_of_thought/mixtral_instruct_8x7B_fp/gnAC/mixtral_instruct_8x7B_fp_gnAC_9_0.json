            "content": "Explanation: This is a logical reasoning question that involves evaluating a conditional statement. The statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is in the form of a conditional statement, often called a hypothetical proposition in logic. It can be symbolized as \"L -> M\", where \"L\" represents 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and \"M\" represents 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. \n\nThe statement 'Mark bought the blue shirt' is given as true. In logical terms, this is called the consequent of our conditional statement. \n\nThe question then asks whether it necessarily follows that 'Lisa bought the red shirt' is true. In logical terms, this is called the antecedent of our conditional statement. \n\nTo answer this question, we need to understand that in a conditional statement, the truth of the consequent does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent. This is because the conditional statement only tells us that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must be true. It does not tell us anything about what happens when the consequent is true.\n\nTherefore, even though 'Mark bought the blue shirt' is true, it does not necessarily mean that 'Lisa bought the red shirt' is true. The truth of 'Mark bought the blue shirt' could be due to some other reason and not because Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: No."
