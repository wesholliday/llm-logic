            "content": "Explanation: This question is testing our understanding of logical conditionals. The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is an example of a conditional statement, where the red apple (the condition) leads to the banana being yellow (the conclusion). \n\nHowever, this conditional statement does not mean that the only way for the banana to be yellow is if the apple is red. There could be other reasons for the banana being yellow. \n\nIn this case, we are given that the banana was indeed yellow, but we don't know whether it was yellow because the apple was red or because of some other reason. Therefore, even though the original conditional statement and the statement about the banana being yellow are both true, we cannot definitively say that the apple was red.\n\nAnswer: No."
