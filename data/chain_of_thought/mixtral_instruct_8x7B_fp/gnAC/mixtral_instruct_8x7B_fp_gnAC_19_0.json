            "content": "Explanation: This question is a application of logical reasoning, specifically using the concept of logical implication, often denoted as \"If P, then Q\". In this case, P represents \"Tom watched football\" and Q represents \"Jen watched basketball\". \n\nThe statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is true when P (Tom watching football) and Q (Jen watching basketball) are both true, or when P is false and Q is true. However, it's also true when P is true and Q is false, or when both P and Q are false.\n\nBut in this particular scenario, we're given that 'Jen watched basketball' is true. So, for the implication \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" to be true, it must be the case that 'Tom watched football' is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
