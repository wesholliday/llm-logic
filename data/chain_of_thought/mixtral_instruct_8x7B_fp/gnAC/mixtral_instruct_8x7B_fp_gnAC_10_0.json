            "content": "Explanation: This is a conditional statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\". This can be written in logical notation as:\n\nD -> C\n\nwhere D represents \"The dog was inside\" and C represents \"The cat was outside\".\n\nThe problem also states that C is true. \n\nTo determine if D must be true, we need to understand conditional statements. A conditional statement is only false when the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false. \n\nIn this case, the hypothesis is that the dog was inside (D), and the conclusion is that the cat was outside (C). Since we know that C is true, the conditional statement cannot be false, because the only way for it to be false is if D is true and C is false.\n\nTherefore, if the conditional statement and C are both true, then D must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
