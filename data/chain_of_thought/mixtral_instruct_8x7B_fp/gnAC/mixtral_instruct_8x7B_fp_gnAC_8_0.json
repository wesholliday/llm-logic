            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of logical reasoning using conditional statements. The given information includes two statements: \n\n1) If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\n2) The mummy was awake\n\nWe need to determine if the second statement implies that the vampire was awake. \n\nTo do this, we use a method called logical deduction. We start with the second statement, which tells us that the mummy was awake. From the first statement, we know that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would also be awake. Since the mummy is indeed awake (as stated in the second statement), this does not contradict the first statement. It could very well be the case that the vampire woke up first, causing the mummy to wake up as well.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the first statement does not explicitly state that the vampire being awake is the only condition for the mummy to be awake. There could be other reasons why the mummy is awake, in which case the vampire might still be asleep. But based on the given information, we have no reason to assume this.\n\nTherefore, while we cannot say for certain that the vampire is awake, we cannot rule out this possibility either. The given statements are consistent with the scenario where the vampire is awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
