We are also given that the second part of the conditional statement, 'Erin took a train', is true. \n\nIn logical terms, this situation can be represented as:\nP (Sam took a plane) -> Q (Erin took a train)\n\nWe are given that Q is true. \n\nThe question asks if it necessarily follows that P is true. \n\nIn general, a true conditional statement (P -> Q) being followed by a true consequent (Q) does not guarantee that the antecedent (P) is also true. This is a common misconception in logic known as affirming the consequent. \n\nHowever, in this specific case, the given condition 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' does not provide any other way for Erin to have taken a train. Therefore, if Erin did take a train, it does necessarily follow that Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
