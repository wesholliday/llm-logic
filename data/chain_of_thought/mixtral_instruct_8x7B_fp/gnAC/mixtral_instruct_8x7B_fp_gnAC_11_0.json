The truth of this conditional statement does not necessarily mean that the cake being chocolate is the only condition for the muffins to be blueberry, just that this specific condition results in blueberry muffins.\n\nHowever, given that the muffins are indeed blueberry, we cannot definitively conclude that the cake was chocolate. There could be other conditions or reasons why the muffins were blueberry. We can only confirm the condition stated in the conditional statement if we are told that the given conditions are the only possible conditions leading to the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No."
