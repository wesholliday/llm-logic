In this case, the converse would be \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza\". However, without further information, we cannot confirm this.\n\nBut here, we are given an additional fact that \"Bob chose pasta\". This fact alone does not guarantee that Sue's choice caused Bob's choice. It could be a coincidence. Therefore, even though both the original conditional statement and the fact that \"Bob chose pasta\" are true, it does not definitively prove that 'Sue chose pizza' is true.\n\nAnswer: No."
