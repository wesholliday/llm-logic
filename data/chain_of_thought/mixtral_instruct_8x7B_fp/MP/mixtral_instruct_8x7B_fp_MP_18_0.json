It's structured as a hypothetical situation where the condition (the doll being plastic) leads to a consequence (the truck being metal). \n\nHowever, this statement doesn't necessarily mean that the reverse is true, i.e., if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. It only tells us that if the doll is indeed plastic, the truck being metal is a possibility.\n\nTo infer that the truck is definitely metal, we would need a statement that directly asserts this fact or a set of conditions that logically lead to this conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No."
