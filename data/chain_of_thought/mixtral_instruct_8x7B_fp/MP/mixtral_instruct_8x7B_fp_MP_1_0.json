            "content": "Explanation: This is a logical reasoning question that involves evaluating a conditional statement and applying it to a given situation. The conditional statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is also known as a material implication. It means that the condition (Mary being at the wedding) and the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) are connected in such a way that if the condition is true, then the consequence must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we are given that 'Mary was at the wedding' is true. Since this is the condition of our material implication, we can now infer that the consequence 'Sue was at the wedding' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
