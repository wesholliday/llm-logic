            "content": "Explanation: This is a conditional statement, often referred to as \"if-then\" statement. The first part, \"If Lisa bought the red shirt\" is the condition. The second part, \"then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is the consequence of that condition. This means that the two events are connected - Lisa buying the red shirt causes Mark to buy the blue shirt.\n\nIn addition, we are given the information that Lisa did indeed buy the red shirt. Given this information, and the fact that Lisa buying the red shirt implies that Mark bought the blue shirt, we can logically infer that Mark did buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
