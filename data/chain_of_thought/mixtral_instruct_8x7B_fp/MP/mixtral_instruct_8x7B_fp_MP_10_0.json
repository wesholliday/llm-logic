            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical statement in the form of \"if p then q\". In this case, p is \"the dog was inside\" and q is \"the cat was outside\". This form of statement is called a conditional statement. \n\nWhen we are given the truth of a conditional statement \"if p then q\" and the truth of p, we can indeed infer q. This is a basic rule of logical reasoning known as Modus Ponens.\n\nSo, in this case, since we know that \"if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" is true, and we are also told that \"the dog was inside\", it follows that \"the cat was outside\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
