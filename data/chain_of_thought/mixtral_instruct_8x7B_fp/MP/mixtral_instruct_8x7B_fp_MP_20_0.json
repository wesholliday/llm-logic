            "content": "Explanation: This question is testing the principle of logical reasoning known as \"modus ponens,\" which states that if P implies Q and P is true, then Q must be true. In this case, the first statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is the conditional statement P implies Q. The second statement \"The apple was red\" is the assertion of P. Therefore, following modus ponens, we can indeed infer that \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes."
