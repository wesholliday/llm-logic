            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument known as modus ponens. The first statement is the conditional or \"if-then\" statement, also known as a hypothetical proposition. The second statement is the antecedent or the \"if\" part of the conditional statement. The conclusion or the \"then\" part of the conditional statement is 'The unicorn was in the forest'. Given that the antecedent 'The griffin was in the forest' is true, we can infer that the conclusion 'The unicorn was in the forest' is also true. This is because the truth of the antecedent guarantees the truth of the consequent in a valid modus ponens argument.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
