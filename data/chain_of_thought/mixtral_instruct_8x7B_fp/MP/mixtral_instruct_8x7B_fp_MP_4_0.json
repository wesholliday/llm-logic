The statement 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter' is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. The part before the 'then' is the hypothesis, and the part after the 'then' is the conclusion. In this case, the hypothesis is 'the alien visited Mars' and the conclusion is 'the robot visited Jupiter'.\n\nThe second statement given is 'The alien visited Mars'. This is the hypothesis of our conditional statement.\n\nNow, if the hypothesis of a conditional statement is true, then the conclusion must also be true. This is known as modus ponens in logic. Therefore, since the hypothesis 'the alien visited Mars' is true, it follows that the conclusion 'the robot visited Jupiter' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
