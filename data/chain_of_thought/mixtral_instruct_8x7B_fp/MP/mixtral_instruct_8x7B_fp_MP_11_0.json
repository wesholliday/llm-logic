            "content": "Explanation: This question is testing logical reasoning and the concept of conditional statements. The statement 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' is a conditional statement, often denoted as \"If P, then Q\". This statement means that if the condition P (the cake being chocolate) is true, then the consequence Q (the muffins being blueberry) must also be true. \n\nThe second statement given is 'The cake was chocolate'. This is the condition P in our conditional statement. Since P is true, and according to our conditional statement 'If P, then Q', the consequence Q (the muffins being blueberry) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
