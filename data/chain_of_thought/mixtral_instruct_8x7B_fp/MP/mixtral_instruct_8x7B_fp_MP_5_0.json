            "content": "Explanation: This question is asking about logical deduction using the concept of conditional statements. The statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis' is a conditional statement, often denoted as \"If P, then Q\". The second statement given is 'Jeff played basketball', which is the condition P in our conditional statement. If P is true, and the conditional statement is also true, then the consequence Q must also be true. In this case, P is true, so if 'If P, then Q' is true, then Q (Amy played tennis) must be true as well.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
