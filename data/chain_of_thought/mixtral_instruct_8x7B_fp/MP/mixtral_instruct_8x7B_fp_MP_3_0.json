            "content": "Explanation: This is an application of the logical rule called Modus Ponens. The rule states that from 'If P, then Q' and 'P', we can infer 'Q'. In this case, the statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' is the conditional statement 'If P, then Q', and the statement 'The book was written by James' is the statement 'P'. Therefore, according to Modus Ponens, we can infer 'The book is a mystery novel'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
