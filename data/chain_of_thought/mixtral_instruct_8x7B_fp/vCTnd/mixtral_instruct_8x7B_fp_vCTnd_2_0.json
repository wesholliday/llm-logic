However, in this case, the given premise 'If Ann exercised, then she did not exercise strenuously' is not the contrapositive of the conclusion 'If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise'. The correct contrapositive of the conclusion would be 'If Ann did not exercise, then she exercised strenuously'. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No."
