However, in this case, the given premise and conclusion are not contrapositives of each other. The correct contrapositive of the premise 'If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly' should be 'If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned'. But the conclusion given is 'If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly', which is not the contrapositive of the premise. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No."
