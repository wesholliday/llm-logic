The original conditional statement is \"If Jane studied, then she did not study long\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If Jane studied long, then she did not study\". This is because the hypothesis and the conclusion are logically equivalent by negating both. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
