The argument is logically valid if the following is true: if P implies not-Q, then R implies not-P. However, this is not the case here. If a recommendation was made and it was not strong, it does not mean that a strong recommendation could not have been made. It's possible for both a weak and a strong recommendation to be made. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No."
