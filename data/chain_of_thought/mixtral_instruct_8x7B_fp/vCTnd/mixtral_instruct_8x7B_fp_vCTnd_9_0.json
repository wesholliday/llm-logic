            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive, which is a valid form of logical argument. The original conditional statement is \"If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given.\" This is logically equivalent to the original statement because it maintains the same truth value. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid."
