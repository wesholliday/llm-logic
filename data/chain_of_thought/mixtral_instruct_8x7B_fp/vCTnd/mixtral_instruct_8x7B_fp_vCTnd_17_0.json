The original conditional statement is \"If the customer was greeted, then they were not greeted warmly\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted\". \n\nIn logic, an argument is valid if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. Here, the premise and the conclusion are contrapositives of each other, which means that if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true, and vice versa. Therefore, this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
