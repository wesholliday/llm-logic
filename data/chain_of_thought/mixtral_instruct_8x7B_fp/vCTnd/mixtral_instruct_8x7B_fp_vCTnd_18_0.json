The original statement is \"If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed\". This is logically valid because the truth of the original statement and its contrapositive are equivalent. If the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
