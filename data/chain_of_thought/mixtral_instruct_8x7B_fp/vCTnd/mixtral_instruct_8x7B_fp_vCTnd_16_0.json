            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive reasoning, which is a valid form of logical reasoning. The original statement can be written in the form \"P -> Q\", where P represents \"the job was completed\" and Q represents \"it was not completed well\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"~Q -> ~P\", which can be translated to \"if the job was completed well, then it was not completed\". Since the argument follows the form of contrapositive reasoning, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
