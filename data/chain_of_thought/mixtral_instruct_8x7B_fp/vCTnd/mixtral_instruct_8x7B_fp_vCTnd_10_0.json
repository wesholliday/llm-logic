Let's use the method of contrapositive to test this. The contrapositive of the first statement 'If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice' is 'If helpful advice was offered, then advice was offered'. This is because the original statement 'If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice' is equivalent to 'If it was helpful advice, then advice was not offered'. \n\nThe second statement 'If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered' is the contrapositive of the conclusion. \n\nSince the contrapositive of the premise and the conclusion are the same, this means that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
