            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive, which is a logically equivalent form of the original conditional statement. The original statement \"If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables\" can be restated as \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store\" by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion and swapping their positions. Since this is a logically valid transformation, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
