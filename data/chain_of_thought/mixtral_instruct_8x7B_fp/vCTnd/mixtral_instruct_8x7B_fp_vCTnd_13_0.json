The original conditional statement is \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much.\" To form the contrapositive, we negate both the antecedent (the 'if' part) and the consequent (the 'then' part), and then switch their positions. So, the contrapositive of the original statement is \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise.\" The argument is valid because the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
