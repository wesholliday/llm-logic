The original conditional statement is \"If directions were provided, then they were not explained clearly.\" The contrapositive of this statement switches the hypothesis and the negation of the conclusion, resulting in \"If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided.\" Since the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
