            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called contrapositive. The original conditional statement is \"If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal\". In logic, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. However, in this case, the original statement is not logically equivalent to the conclusion. If you ate a large meal, it does not mean that you did not eat a meal at all. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No."
