The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'if P, then Q' is 'if not Q, then not P'. In this case, the premise can be written as 'if Ben studied (P), then he did not study diligently (not Q)'. Therefore, its contrapositive 'if Ben studied diligently (Q), then he did not study (not P)' is a valid argument.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
