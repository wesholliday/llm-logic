            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive reasoning, where the original conditional statement is rephrased by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion and then reversing the order. In this case, the original statement is \"If it's raining, then it's not raining hard,\" which is equivalent to \"If it's not raining hard, then it's raining.\" The argument's conclusion is \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining.\" By negating both the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement, we get \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining,\" which is the conclusion of the argument. Since the conclusion logically follows from the premise, this argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
