            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as contrapositive reasoning, which is a valid form of logical reasoning. The original statement can be written in the form \"A -> not B\", where A represents \"the room was tidied\" and B represents \"it was tidied thoroughly\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"not B -> not A\", which can be rewritten as \"if the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied\". Since the argument is in the form of a contrapositive, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
