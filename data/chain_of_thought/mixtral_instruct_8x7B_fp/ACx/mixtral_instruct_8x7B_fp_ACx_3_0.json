If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\n2. The splat quanked.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the splat was morphed, we need to check if the second statement (the splat quanked) can be logically deduced from the first statement (if the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked) and the given information (the splat quanked).\n\nTo do this, we can use a method called \"modus ponens,\" which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (if P, then Q) and the antecedent of that statement (P), we can infer the consequent of that statement (Q).\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"if the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked,\" and the given information is \"the splat quanked.\" We can rewrite the given information as \"the splat quanked is true,\" which can be used as the antecedent P in our conditional statement.\n\nNow, we can apply modus ponens:\n1. If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\n2. The splat quanked is true.\n\nSince the given information matches the antecedent of our conditional statement, we can infer the consequent of the statement:\n3. The splat quanked.\n\nHowever, our goal is to determine if we can infer that the splat was morphed. To do this, we need to check if the antecedent of our conditional statement (the splat was morphed) can be inferred from the given information and the consequent of our conditional statement (the splat quanked).\n\nIn this case, we cannot directly infer that the splat was morphed from the given information and the consequent of our conditional statement. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the splat was morphed.\n\nAnswer: No."
