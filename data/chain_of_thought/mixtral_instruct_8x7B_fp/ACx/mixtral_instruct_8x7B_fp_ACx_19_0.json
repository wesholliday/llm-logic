The principle of logical deduction states that if A implies B (i.e., A -> B) and B is true, then A must be true. This is also known as modus ponens.\n\nIn this case, the first statement 'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged' can be represented as 'smonk was vreebled' implies 'smonk plagged', or 'smonk was vreebled -> smonk plagged'. The second statement 'The smonk plagged' tells us that the smonk did indeed plag.\n\nBased on the principle of modus ponens, since 'smonk was vreebled' implies 'smonk plagged' and we know that 'smonk plagged', it must be the case that 'smonk was vreebled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
