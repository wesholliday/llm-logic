The concept here is called \"modus ponens\" in logic, which states that if P implies Q, and P is true, then Q must also be true. \n\nIn this case, the first statement 'If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint' can be broken down into two parts: P (the wug was flooped) implies Q (the wug bimmed the zoint). The second statement given is 'The wug bimmed the zoint', which matches part Q of the first statement.\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'The wug was flooped' (P), we need to check if the second statement (Q) aligns with the conditions set by the first statement. Since Q is true and Q is dependent on P being true according to the first statement, it follows that P must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
