The information given consists of two statements:\n\n1. If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\n2. The whiffle tinked.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer that the whiffle was shanked. To do this, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, often referred to as an \"if-then\" statement. It tells us that if the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked. This statement does not necessarily mean that the whiffle was shanked, only that if it was, then it would have tinked.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the whiffle tinked. However, this statement does not provide any information about whether the whiffle was shanked or not.\n\nTo infer that the whiffle was shanked, we would need additional information that links the tinkling of the whiffle to it being shanked. Without such information, we cannot make that inference.\n\nAnswer: No."
