It means that if the condition (the fleeg being bluttered) is true, then the consequence (it surned) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement, 'The fleeg surned', is the consequence part of the first statement. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'The fleeg was bluttered', we need to see if the first statement's condition is true. \n\nHowever, the first statement's condition is not given as true or false, so we cannot definitively say that 'The fleeg was bluttered' is true.\n\nAnswer: No."
