In this case, the conditional statement is \"if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,\" and the antecedent is \"the pants were denim.\" However, we cannot directly infer the consequent \"the shirt was cotton\" because the truth of the antecedent does not necessarily mean the truth of the consequent. It is possible that the pants were denim but the shirt was not cotton. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the shirt was cotton based on the given information. Answer: No."
