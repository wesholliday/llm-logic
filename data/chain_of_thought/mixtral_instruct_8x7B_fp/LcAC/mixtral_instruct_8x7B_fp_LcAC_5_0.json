The original statement is in the form of a conditional: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This is also known as a material implication. The second statement is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nTo determine if we can logically conclude \"Jeff played basketball,\" we need to consider the truth values of the original statement. If the original statement is true, then there are two possibilities: either both Jeff played basketball and Amy played tennis, or Jeff did not play basketball and Amy played tennis. The second statement tells us that Amy did indeed play tennis, but it does not tell us anything about whether Jeff played basketball.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically conclude that \"Jeff played basketball.\"\n\nAnswer: No."
