            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument known as modus ponens, where we have a conditional statement (if P, then Q) and we are given that the antecedent (P) is true. In this case, P is 'the doll was plastic' and Q is 'the truck was metal'. We are also given that the consequent (Q) is true, i.e., the truck was metal. Therefore, according to the rules of modus ponens, we can conclude that the antecedent P must also be true, i.e., the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
