            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument known as modus ponens, which has the form \"If P, then Q; P; therefore Q.\" In this case, P represents \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q represents \"Bob chose pasta.\" We are given the conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" (or \"If P, then Q\") and also told that the second part of the conditional statement is true (or \"P\"). Therefore, we can conclude that the consequence of the conditional statement is also true (or \"Q\"), which means that \"Bob chose pasta.\" However, this doesn't directly tell us whether or not \"Sue chose pizza.\" To determine that, we need to use the fact that the conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is equivalent to its contrapositive statement \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\" Since we know that \"Bob chose pasta\" is true, its negation \"Bob did not choose pasta\" is false. Therefore, its contrapositive statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is also true, and its antecedent \"Sue chose pizza\" must be true as well.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
