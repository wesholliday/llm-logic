If the statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is true, and we know that \"Lucy went to the zoo\" (q is true), then it could be the case that Joe went to the park (p is true), but it's not necessarily so. The only situation we can rule out is that Joe went to the park and Lucy didn't go to the zoo, because that would make the original conditional statement false. But if Lucy went to the zoo for some other reason, then Joe's actions are not determined by the information given.\n\nAnswer: No."
