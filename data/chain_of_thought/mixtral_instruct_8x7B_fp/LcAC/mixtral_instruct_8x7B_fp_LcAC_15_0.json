            "content": "Explanation: This is a logical reasoning question that involves evaluating a conditional statement and determining if it fits a certain scenario. The given conditional statement is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This is in the form of p -> q, where p represents \"Sam took a plane\" and q represents \"Erin took a train.\"\n\nThe second piece of information given is \"Erin took a train,\" which corresponds to q being true. In order to determine if we can logically conclude that Sam took a plane, we need to examine the truth table for the conditional statement:\n\n| p (Sam took a plane) | q (Erin took a train) | p -> q (If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train) |\n|---|---|---|\n| T | T | T |\n| T | F | F |\n| F | T | T |\n| F | F | T |\n\nIn this case, we are given that q (Erin took a train) is true. Looking at the truth table, we can see that when q is true, p can be either true or false, and the conditional statement p -> q would still be true. However, if we want to find a situation where the given conditional statement and the additional information about Erin both hold true, then p must be true as well.\n\nTherefore, based on the given conditional statement and the information that Erin took a train, we can logically conclude that Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
