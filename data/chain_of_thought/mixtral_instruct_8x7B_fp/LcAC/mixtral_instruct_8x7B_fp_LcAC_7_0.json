This means that Alex finishing the race is a sufficient condition for Chris finishing the race. However, it does not necessarily mean that Alex finishing the race is a necessary condition for Chris finishing the race. \n\nBut, in this case, we are given an additional piece of information: Chris finished the race. This means that either Alex finishing the race is both sufficient and necessary for Chris finishing the race (if they ran the race together, for example), or that there is another way for Chris to have finished the race (if, for example, Chris was not running the same race as Alex but a different one).\n\nWithout further information, we cannot definitively say whether Alex finishing the race is a necessary condition for Chris finishing the race. But the given information is logically consistent with Alex finishing the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
