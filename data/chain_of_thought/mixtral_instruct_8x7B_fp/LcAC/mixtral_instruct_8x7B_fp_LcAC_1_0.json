            "content": "Explanation: This is a question of logical reasoning, specifically whether we can use the principle of logical deduction known as \"modus ponens\" to establish that Mary was at the wedding. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (in this case, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\") and the antecedent of that statement is true (in this case, \"Sue was at the wedding\"), then the consequent must also be true (\"Mary was at the wedding\").\n\nHowever, in this case, we cannot use modus ponens to establish that Mary was at the wedding. This is because the statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" does not allow us to conclude that Mary was at the wedding, even if Sue was at the wedding. All we can conclude is that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. It does not necessarily follow that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No."
