            "content": "Explanation: This is a logical reasoning question that follows the structure of an \"if-then\" statement, also known as a conditional statement. The first sentence, \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt,\" is the conditional statement. It tells us that Lisa buying the red shirt is the condition for Mark buying the blue shirt. The second sentence, \"Mark bought the blue shirt,\" gives us information about what has happened.\n\nTo determine if we can logically conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt, we need to use logical reasoning. We can use a method called \"modus ponens,\" which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. It states that if p implies q and p is true, then q must be true.\n\nIn this case, p is \"Lisa bought the red shirt,\" and q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" We are given that q is true, and we are also given the conditional statement that p implies q. Therefore, using modus ponens, we can conclude that p must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
