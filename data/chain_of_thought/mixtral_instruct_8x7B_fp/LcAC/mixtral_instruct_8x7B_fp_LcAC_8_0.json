This is also known as a material implication in logic, often denoted as 'Vampire awake' -> 'Mummy awake'. \n\nThe statement 'The mummy was awake' is a fact. \n\nHowever, just because the mummy was awake, it doesn't necessarily mean that the vampire was awake. The only time when we can conclude that the vampire was awake is when we know that the mummy was awake and the condition 'If the vampire was awake' is true. \n\nAnswer: No."
