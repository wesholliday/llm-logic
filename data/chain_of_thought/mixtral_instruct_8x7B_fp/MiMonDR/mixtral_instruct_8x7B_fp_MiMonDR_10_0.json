            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The computer might be broken\" implies that there is a possibility that the computer is not functioning correctly. However, it does not explicitly affirm that the computer might also be working. To infer that the computer might be working, we need to consider the implicit possibility that the computer could be in a state other than being broken, which includes the possibility of it functioning correctly. Therefore, while it is reasonable to infer that 'The computer might be working or broken' from the original statement, it requires an additional step of logical reasoning.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
