However, it does not explicitly rule out the possibility of the train being on time. Therefore, the second statement \"The train might be on time or late\" is a more inclusive and general version of the first statement, as it accounts for both potential scenarios - the train being on time and the train being late.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
