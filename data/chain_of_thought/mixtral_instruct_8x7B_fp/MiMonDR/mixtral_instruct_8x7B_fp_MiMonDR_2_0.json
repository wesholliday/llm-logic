It does not rule out the possibility of other locations, such as the drawer. However, it also does not provide any explicit information suggesting that the book might be in the drawer. Therefore, while the inference \"The book might be in the drawer or on the shelf\" is a possibility, it goes beyond the information provided in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
