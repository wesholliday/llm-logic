A house is a common place where people keep their keys, so it is reasonable to consider it as another possible location. However, just because the keys might be in the car, it does not necessarily mean that they might also be in the house. The two statements are not mutually exclusive, but one does not automatically imply the other.\n\nAnswer: No."
