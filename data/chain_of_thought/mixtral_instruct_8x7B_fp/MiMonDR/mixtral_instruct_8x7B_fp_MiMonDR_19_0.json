However, it does not rule out the possibility of the project failing. In fact, in many contexts, when someone says \"The project might be successful,\" they are acknowledging that there is a chance of success, but they are not making any claims about the probability of success or failure. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the project might also fail.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
