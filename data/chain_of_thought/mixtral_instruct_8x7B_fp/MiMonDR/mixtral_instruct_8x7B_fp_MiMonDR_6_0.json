However, it does not explicitly rule out the possibility of the movie being boring. To infer \"The movie might be boring or interesting\" from the original statement, we are making an assumption that both outcomes are possible since the original statement only highlights the possibility of the movie being interesting, but does not confirm it as a certainty. Therefore, the original statement does not explicitly lead to the inferred statement, but it can be inferred with the assumption of both possibilities being open.\n\nAnswer: No."
