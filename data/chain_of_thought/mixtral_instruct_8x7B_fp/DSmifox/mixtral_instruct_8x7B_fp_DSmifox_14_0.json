The statement \"Either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked\" presents two possibilities: the clug is snugged or the clug is fleeked. Since we know from the first statement that there is a possibility that the clug is not snugged, it must be the case that the clug is fleeked in order for the second statement to be true. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The clug is fleeked\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
