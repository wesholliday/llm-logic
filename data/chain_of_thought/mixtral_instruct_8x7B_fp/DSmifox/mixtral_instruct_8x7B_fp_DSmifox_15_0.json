This means that the dreb being spent is not certain or guaranteed. The second statement \"Either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed\" presents two possibilities: the dreb must be spent or it is vroombed. Since we know from the first statement that the dreb might not be spent, it means that the second possibility in the second statement must be true, which is that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
