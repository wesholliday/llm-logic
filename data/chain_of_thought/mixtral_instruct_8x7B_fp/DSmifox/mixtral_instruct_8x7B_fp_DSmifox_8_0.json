            "content": "Explanation:  The statement 'The sprocket might not be daggled' means that it is possible for the sprocket to not be daggled, which implies that the sprocket could be in a normal condition (not daggled) or in a faulty condition (cranked). \n\nThe second statement 'Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked' is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two conditions must be true. \n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked because the first statement tells us that the sprocket could be in a normal condition (not daggled), but the second statement contradicts this by stating that the sprocket must be daggled or cranked. Since the first statement allows for the possibility that the sprocket is not daggled, the second statement's 'must be daggled' part cannot be true, leaving us with the only remaining option that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
