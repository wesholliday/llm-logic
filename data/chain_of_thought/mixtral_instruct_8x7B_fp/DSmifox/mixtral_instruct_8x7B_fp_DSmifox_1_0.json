This means that the flugel can be in a state where it is not zargled, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it is blimmed.\n\nThe second statement, 'Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed', presents two possibilities: either the flugel is zargled, or it is blimmed. Since we know from the first statement that it is possible for the flugel not to be zargled, we can consider the second possibility, which is that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that 'The flugel is blimmed'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
