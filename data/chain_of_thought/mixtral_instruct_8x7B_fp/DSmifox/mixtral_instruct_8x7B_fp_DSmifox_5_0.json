This means that the zinger could be either fraggled or not smoogled in any situation where the zinger is not smoogled. \n\nThe second statement, 'Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled', presents two possibilities: either the zinger is smoogled or it is fraggled. Since we already know from the first statement that the zinger might not be smoogled, the only possibility left is that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this inference is based on the assumption that the two statements are true and that their premises do not contradict each other.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
