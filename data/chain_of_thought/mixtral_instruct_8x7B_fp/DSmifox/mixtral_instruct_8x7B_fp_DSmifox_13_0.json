This does not rule out the possibility that it could be slogged. The second statement \"Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged\" presents two possibilities: either the glip is tagged or it is slogged. Since the first statement does not definitively say that the glip must be tagged, the second possibility remains open. Therefore, based on these two statements, we can infer that \"The glip is slogged\" is a possibility.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
