The statement 'Either the wug must be garbled or it is sproinged' is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two options must be true. However, the statement does not exclude the possibility that the wug could be neither garbled nor sproinged. Therefore, from these two statements, we cannot infer that 'The wug is sproinged'. We can only conclude that the wug is not both garbled and not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: No."
