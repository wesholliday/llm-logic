However, this does not rule out the possibility that the shank could be plooked. The second statement, 'Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked', presents two possibilities: that the shank is nugged or that it is plooked. Since we know from the first statement that the shank might not be nugged, it cannot be certain that the shank is nugged. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that 'The shank is plooked'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
