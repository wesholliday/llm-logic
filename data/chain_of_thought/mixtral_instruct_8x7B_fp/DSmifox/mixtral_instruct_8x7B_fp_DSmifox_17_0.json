Since the first statement tells us that the flob might not be movated, this means that the flob cannot be in the first possibility of the second statement, and therefore, it must be in the second possibility: that the flob is skizzled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
