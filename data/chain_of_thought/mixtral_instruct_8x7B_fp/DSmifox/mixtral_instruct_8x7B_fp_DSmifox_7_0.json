The statement 'Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked' is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two statements must be true. If the first part of the disjunction (the whiffle must be tinked) is false (as suggested by the first statement), then the second part of the disjunction (it is shanked) must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
