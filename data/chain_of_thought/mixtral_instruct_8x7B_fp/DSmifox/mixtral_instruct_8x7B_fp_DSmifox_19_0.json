It does not rule out the possibility that the smonk is vreebled. The statement \"Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled\" is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two options must be true. However, it does not specify which one must be true. It is possible that the smonk is plagged, but it is also possible that it is vreebled. Without further information, we cannot infer that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: No."
