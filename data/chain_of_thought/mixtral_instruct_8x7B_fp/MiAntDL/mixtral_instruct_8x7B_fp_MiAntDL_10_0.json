            "content": "Explanation: The phrase 'The document might be signed or notarized' contains two possible scenarios: the document might be signed, or it might be notarized. Notarization is a process that often involves signing, but it also includes other steps such as verifying the identity of the signer and ensuring they are entering into the agreement knowingly and willingly. However, the statement does not specify that the only instance in which the document could be signed is when it is notarized. It's possible that the document could be signed in other contexts as well. Therefore, while one of the scenarios allowing for the document to be signed is mentioned, it doesn't exclude the possibility of other scenarios where the document might be signed.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
