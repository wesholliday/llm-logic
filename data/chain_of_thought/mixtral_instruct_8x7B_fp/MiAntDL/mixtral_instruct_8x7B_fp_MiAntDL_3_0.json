            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The keys might be in the drawer or on the table' is a disjunction, meaning that it describes two possibilities: either the keys are in the drawer, or they are on the table. The word 'or' is used here in the inclusive sense, which means that both possibilities could be true. Therefore, the fact that the statement includes 'The keys might be in the drawer' as one of the possibilities allows us to infer that the keys might indeed be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
