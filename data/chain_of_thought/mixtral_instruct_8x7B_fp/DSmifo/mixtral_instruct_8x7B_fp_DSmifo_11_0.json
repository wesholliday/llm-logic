The statement Either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway is a logical disjunction, meaning that only one of the two options must be true. \n\nIf the newspaper is not on the porch, as the first statement suggests, then it must be in the driveway, as stated in the second statement. Therefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
