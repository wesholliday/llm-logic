It's a possibility, not a certainty.\n\nThe second statement is a disjunction, meaning the remote control is either in one place or the other. \n\nTogether, these statements don't necessarily lead to the conclusion that the remote control is on the coffee table. The first statement contradicts this conclusion because it states that the remote control might not be under the couch, but it doesn't specify where it is. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that the remote control is on the coffee table based on these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: No."
