Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf.\n\nThe first statement tells us that it's possible that the book is not on the table, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that the book could be on the shelf.\n\nThe second statement presents two possibilities: a) the book is on the table, or b) the book is on the shelf. The first part of this statement (the book is on the table) contradicts the information given in the first statement. Therefore, we are left with the second possibility: the book is on the shelf.\n\nHowever, this conclusion is based on the assumption that the only possible locations for the book are the table and the shelf. If there are other possible locations, then the conclusion would not necessarily follow.\n\nAnswer: Yes, given the assumptions stated above."
