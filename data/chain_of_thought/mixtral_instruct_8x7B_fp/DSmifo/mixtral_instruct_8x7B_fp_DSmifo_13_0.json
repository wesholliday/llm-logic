The first statement implies that the toy might not be in its usual place, the bookshelf, but it doesn't exclude the possibility of it being in some other place. The second statement presents two possibilities: either the bookshelf or the toy box. Since we know from the first statement that the toy is not on the bookshelf, it must be in the only other possibility mentioned - the toy box.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
