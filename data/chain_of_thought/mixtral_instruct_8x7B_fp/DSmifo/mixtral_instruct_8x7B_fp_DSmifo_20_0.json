Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can't definitively say where the sunglasses are, just that they might not be on her head. The second statement presents us with two possibilities: a) the sunglasses are perched on her head, or b) they are in her bag. Since the first statement tells us that the sunglasses might not be on her head, it implies that they must be in the second possible location mentioned in the second statement, which is her bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
