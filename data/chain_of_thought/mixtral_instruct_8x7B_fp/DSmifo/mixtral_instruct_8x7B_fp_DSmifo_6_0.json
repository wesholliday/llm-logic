Either the phone must be ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room.\n\nThe first statement tells us that the phone could possibly not be ringing in the kitchen, which means it could be somewhere else like the living room. The second statement gives us two options for where the phone could be if it's ringing: either the kitchen or the living room. It doesn't explicitly state that the phone cannot be in any other place but the kitchen or the living room.\n\nTaking these two statements together, we can infer that there is a possibility that the phone is in the living room, even when it's not ringing in the kitchen.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
