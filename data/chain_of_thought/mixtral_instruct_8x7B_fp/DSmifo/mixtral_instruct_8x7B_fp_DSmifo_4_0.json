Either the cat is playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch. (Statement B)\n\nFirst, let's break down Statement B into two separate statements:\n   a. The cat is playing in the bedroom.\n   b. The cat is napping on the couch.\n\nNow, Statement A suggests that the cat might not be in the bedroom, which contradicts Statement B(a) but does not necessarily confirm Statement B(b). However, Statement B(a) and Statement B(b) are exclusive, meaning only one of them can be true at a time. Since Statement A does not confirm Statement B(a), it leaves the possibility for Statement B(b) to be true.\n\nBut Statement A does not provide enough information to confirm that the cat is napping on the couch. It only implies that the cat might not be playing in the bedroom, leaving open other possibilities like the cat could be somewhere else or not at home.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The cat is napping on the couch'.\n\nAnswer: No."
