This does not rule out the possibility that the umbrella could be in the car. The second statement, 'Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car', presents two possibilities: that the umbrella is in the closet or in the car. Since we know from the first statement that the umbrella is not definitely in the closet, it follows that the umbrella must be in the car.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
