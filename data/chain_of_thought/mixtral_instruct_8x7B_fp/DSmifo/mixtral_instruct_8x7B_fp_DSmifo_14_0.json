            "content": "Explanation: To infer that 'The milk is on the counter', we need to be sure that the milk is not in the fridge. 'The milk might not be chilling in the fridge' suggests that the milk might be somewhere else, not just that it's not in the fridge. 'Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter' is a statement that presents two possibilities, but it doesn't exclude the possibility that the milk could be somewhere else. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The milk is on the counter' from these two statements.\n\nAnswer: No."
