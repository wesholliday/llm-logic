This does not definitively tell us where the cookies are, only that they might not be in the pantry.\n\nThe second statement, \"Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar,\" is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two components must be true. In this case, the first component states that the cookies must be in the pantry, and the second component states that they are in the jar.\n\nSince we have established that the cookies might not be in the pantry, the first component of the second statement cannot be true. Therefore, the second component must be true, which means that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer:  Yes"
