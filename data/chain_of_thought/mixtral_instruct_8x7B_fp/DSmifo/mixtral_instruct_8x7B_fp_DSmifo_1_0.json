The statement 'Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside' is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two options must be true. However, the first option, 'Fido must be in the garden', is in conflict with the information given in the first statement. Therefore, in order for the disjunction to be true, the second option, 'Fido is inside', must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
