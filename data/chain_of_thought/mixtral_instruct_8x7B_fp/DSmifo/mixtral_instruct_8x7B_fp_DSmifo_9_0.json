This doesn't necessarily mean it's in the box, but it opens up the possibility. \n\nThe second statement, \"Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box,\" is a logical disjunction, meaning at least one of the two statements must be true. \n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor. But we cannot directly infer that it is in the box. It could be anywhere else as well. The statements limit the possible locations of the missing piece to not being on the floor and possibly being in the box, but they do not definitively place the piece in the box.\n\nAnswer: No."
