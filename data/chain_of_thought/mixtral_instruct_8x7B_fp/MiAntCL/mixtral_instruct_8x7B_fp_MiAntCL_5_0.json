However, it does not explicitly mention whether the package will be signed for or not upon delivery. The second statement \"The package might be delivered today and signed for\" includes the possibility of the package being signed for, which is not specified in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that the package will definitely be signed for just because it might be delivered today.\n\nAnswer: No."
