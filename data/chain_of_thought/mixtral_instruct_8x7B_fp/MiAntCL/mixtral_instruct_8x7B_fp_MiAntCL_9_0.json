However, it does not provide any information about the nature or extent of the disruption. The phrase \"and rerouted\" adds a new piece of information that was not present in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The flight might be delayed and rerouted\" from \"The flight might be delayed\" alone.\n\nAnswer: No."
