            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The car must have been in the garage and needed repairs\" can be broken down into two parts: \"The car must have been in the garage\" and \"needed repairs\". The second part, \"needed repairs\", is an independent clause as it implies that the car was not functioning properly. Even if we remove the first part of the sentence, the inference that the car needed repairs still holds true, as it is not dependent on the car being in the garage. Therefore, we can infer that 'The car must have needed repairs'.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
