            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM\" contains two separate ideas conjoined by the word 'and'. The word 'and' typically indicates that the two ideas it connects are independent of each other. In this case, the idea that the concert started at 8 PM is one of those ideas. The first idea, that the concert must have been sold out, does not affect the validity of the second idea. Therefore, even if we remove the first idea, the second idea can still stand on its own. Thus, we can infer \"The concert must have started at 8 PM\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
