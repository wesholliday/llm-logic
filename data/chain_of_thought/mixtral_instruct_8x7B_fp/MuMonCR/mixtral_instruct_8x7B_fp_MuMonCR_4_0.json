When we break down this statement, we can extract two pieces of information: the time of the meeting and the location of the meeting. The part that says \"in the conference room\" is giving us information about where the meeting is going to be held. Since this information is not dependent on the time of the meeting, we can extract this fact independently. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"The meeting must have been in the conference room,\" because this information is explicitly stated in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
