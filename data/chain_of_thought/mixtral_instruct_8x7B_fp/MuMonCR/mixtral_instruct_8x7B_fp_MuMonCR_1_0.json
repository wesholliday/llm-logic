However, this does not necessarily mean that there are no other places where the envelope could be. It is possible that the envelope is under multiple things, one of which is a bed upstairs. It is also possible that the envelope is in other locations as well.\n\nWithout additional information, we cannot definitively say that the envelope must be under a bed. It is possible, but we cannot be certain. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The envelope must have been under a bed' based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
