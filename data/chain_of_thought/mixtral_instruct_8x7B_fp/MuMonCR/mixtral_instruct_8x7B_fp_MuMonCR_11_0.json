            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The software must have been updated\" implies that some changes were made to the software. One common practice after updating software is to restart the system to ensure that all changes take effect. However, it's also possible that an update doesn't require a restart. But since the statement doesn't specify if a restart occurred or not, we can't definitively say that a restart happened. Therefore, we can't infer 'The software must have been restarted' based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No."
