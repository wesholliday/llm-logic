            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The event must have been formal and required tickets\" contains two pieces of information. The first part is \"The event must have been formal,\" and the second part is \"required tickets.\" Both parts are connected by the conjunction \"and,\" which means both conditions must be true for the statement to be valid. However, the first part about the event being formal does not affect the second part about requiring tickets. Even if the event is not formal, it can still require tickets. Therefore, the second part of the statement, \"required tickets,\" can be inferred independently.\nAnswer: Yes"
