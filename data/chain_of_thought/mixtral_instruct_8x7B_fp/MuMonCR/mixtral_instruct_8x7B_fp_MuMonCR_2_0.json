            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The book must have been on the shelf and had a red cover\" contains two pieces of information: the book was on the shelf, and the book had a red cover. The second piece of information is independent of the first - it doesn't matter where the book was, it can still have a red cover. So, even though the first part of the statement (\"The book must have been on the shelf\") is removed, the remaining part (\"had a red cover\") is still true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The book must have had a red cover\".\n\nAnswer: Yes"
