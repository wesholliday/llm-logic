It could be in a state of 'sploffed' or any other state but 'plopped'. \n\nThe second statement, 'Either the grommet is plopped or it is sploffed', presents two possibilities for the state of the grommet - 'plopped' or 'sploffed'. \n\nSince we know from the first statement that the grommet is not 'plopped', it must be in the other state mentioned in the second statement, which is 'sploffed'. \n\nAnswer: Yes"
