The second statement \"Either the glip is tragged or it is slogged\" is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two conditions must be true. If the glip is not \"tragged\", and we know that at least one of the conditions must be true, then it must be the case that the glip is \"slogged\". This is an example of logical reasoning using negation and disjunction.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
