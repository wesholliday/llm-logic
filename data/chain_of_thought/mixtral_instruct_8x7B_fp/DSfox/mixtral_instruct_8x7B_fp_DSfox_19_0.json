The second statement, 'Either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled', is a disjunction, which means that one or the other statement must be true. If the first statement is true and the smonk is not plagged, then the second statement implies that the smonk must be vreebled. Therefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'The smonk is vreebled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
