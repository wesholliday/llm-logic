The second statement can be broken down into two parts: \"The fleeg is surned\" and \"It is bluttered if the fleeg is not surned\".\n\nGiven that \"The fleeg is not surned\", we can infer from the second statement that \"It is bluttered if the fleeg is not surned\". Therefore, since we know that the fleeg is not surned, it must be true that \"It is bluttered\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
