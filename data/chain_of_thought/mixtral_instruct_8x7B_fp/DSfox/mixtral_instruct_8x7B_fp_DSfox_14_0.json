The second statement, \"Either the clug is snugged or it is fleeked,\" is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two options must be true. If the clug is not snugged, as we know from the first statement, then the second option in the second statement must be true, which is \"it is fleeked.\" Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
