            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The sprocket is not daggled' means the opposite of 'daggled' is true, i.e., the sprocket is not in a damaged or useless state. The second statement 'Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked' presents two possibilities: either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked. Since we know from the first statement that the sprocket is not daggled, the only remaining possibility is that it is cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
