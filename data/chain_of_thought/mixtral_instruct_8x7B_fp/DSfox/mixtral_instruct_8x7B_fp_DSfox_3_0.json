It is an inclusive disjunction, which means that one or both of the statements can be true. In this case, the second statement can be broken down into:\n- The splat is quanked\n- The splat is morphed\n\nHowever, the first statement tells us that \"The splat is not quanked\". Since the first statement contradicts the first part of the second statement, the second part must be true. Therefore, \"The splat is morphed\" can be inferred to be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
