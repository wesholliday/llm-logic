Either the shank is nugged or it is plooked.\n\nThe second statement is a disjunction, which means it's true if at least one of its parts is true. In this case, the first part (the shank is nugged) is false, as stated in the first sentence. However, for the whole disjunction to be true, the second part must be true. Therefore, since the shank is not nugged, it must be plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
