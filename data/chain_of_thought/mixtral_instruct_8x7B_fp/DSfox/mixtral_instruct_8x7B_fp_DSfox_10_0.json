The second statement, 'Either the wug is garbled or it is sproinged', presents two possibilities for the state of the wug. Since we know from the first statement that the wug is not garbled, it must be in the other state presented in the second statement, which is 'sproinged'. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The wug is sproinged'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
