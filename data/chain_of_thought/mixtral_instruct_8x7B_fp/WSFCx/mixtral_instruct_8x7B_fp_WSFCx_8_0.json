However, the statement we are asked to infer is \"The snork might be crunk and it might be quibble,\" which is a conjunction, meaning that the snork can be both things at once.\n\nIn general, we cannot infer a conjunction from a disjunction, because the two logical operators have different meanings. In this case, the original statement only tells us that the snork cannot be both crunk and quibble at the same time, but it does not tell us that the snork can be both.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The snork might be crunk and it might be quibble.\"\n\nAnswer: No."
