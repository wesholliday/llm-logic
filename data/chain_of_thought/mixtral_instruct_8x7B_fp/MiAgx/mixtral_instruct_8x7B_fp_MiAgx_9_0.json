It's saying that there's a chance the wump is quank, and independently, there's a chance the snorkel is snizzle. \n\nWhen we want to combine these possibilities into one sentence, we say \"It might be that the wump is quank and the snorkel is snizzle\". This formulation maintains the independent nature of the two possibilities, which is exactly what the original sentence conveyed.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
