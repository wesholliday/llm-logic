            "content": "Explanation: The phrase \"The snorkel might be plonk and the snork might be wibble\" is a sentence fragment with two independent clauses. Each clause is stating that the snorkel or the snork might be a certain way, but the way it is written does not explicitly state that it is referring to the same \"it\" in both clauses. However, it is reasonable to infer that the sentence is implying that \"it might be that the snorkel is plonk and the snork is wibble\" because the context suggests that both clauses are referring to the same objects, just with different modifiers.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
