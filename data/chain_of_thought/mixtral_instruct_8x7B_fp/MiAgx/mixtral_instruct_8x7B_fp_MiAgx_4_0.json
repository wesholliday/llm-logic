It's possible that they are in these locations, but it's also possible that they are not.\n\nThe statement \"It might be that the flimble is at wozzle wozzle and the gribble is in the snork wozzle\" is essentially the same as the first statement, as it is still expressing uncertainty about the locations of the flimble and the gribble.\n\nTherefore, the two statements convey the same meaning and one can be inferred from the other.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
