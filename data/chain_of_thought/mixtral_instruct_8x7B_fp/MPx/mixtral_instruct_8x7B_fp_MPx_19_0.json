The smonk was vreebled.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer from these two statements that the smonk plagged. To do this, we can use the concept of logical implication.\n\nThe first statement is an implication: \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\" This can be written in logical notation as:\n\nvreebled(smonk) -> plagged(smonk)\n\nThe second statement is a simple fact: \"The smonk was vreebled,\" or vreebled(smonk).\n\nTo infer that \"the smonk plagged,\" we need to apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (P -> Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then we can infer the consequent (Q).\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\" (vreebled(smonk) -> plagged(smonk)), and the antecedent is \"The smonk was vreebled\" (vreebled(smonk)). Since the antecedent is true, we can apply modus ponens and infer that \"The smonk plagged\" (plagged(smonk)).\n\nAnswer: Yes."
