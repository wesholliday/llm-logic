            "content": "Explanation: This question is testing whether we can make a logical deduction based on the given information. The statement 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked' is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement, which can also be represented as \"p -> q\". Here, p represents 'the splat was morphed', and q represents 'the splat quanked'. \n\nThe second statement given is 'The splat was morphed', which is the same as 'p'. \n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer 'The splat quanked', which is the same as 'q'. \n\nTo make this inference, we need to ensure that the condition (p) is true and that the conditional statement (p -> q) is also true. In this case, both conditions hold true. \n\nAnswer: Yes."
