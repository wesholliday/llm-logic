            "content": "Explanation: This question involves logical reasoning based on conditional statements. The statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garbled\" is a conditional statement, often denoted as \"If P, then Q\". This statement means that if the condition P (the wug was sproinged) is true, then the consequence Q (it was garbled) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement given is \"The wug was sproinged\", which is the condition P in our conditional statement. Since P is true, then according to the conditional statement, the consequence Q (it was garbled) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that \"It was garbled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
