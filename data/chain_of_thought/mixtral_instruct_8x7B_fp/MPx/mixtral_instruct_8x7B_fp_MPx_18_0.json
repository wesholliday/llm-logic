            "content": "Explanation: This question is testing whether we can make a logical deduction based on the given information. The statement 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged' is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement, which can be represented as \"P -> Q\". The second statement is 'The shank was plooked', which is represented as \"P\". \n\nTo determine if 'The shank was nugged' (Q) follows from these statements, we need to examine the conditional statement. The conditional statement 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged' means that plooking the shank implies that the shank was nugged. Since we know that the shank was plooked (P), and plooking the shank implies that the shank was nugged (Q), we can indeed infer that the shank was nugged (Q).\n\nAnswer: Yes."
