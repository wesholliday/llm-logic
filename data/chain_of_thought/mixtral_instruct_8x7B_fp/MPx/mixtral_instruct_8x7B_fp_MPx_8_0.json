Modus Ponens is a rule of inference that allows us to infer a conclusion from two premises if the first premise is in the form 'If P, then Q' and the second premise is in the form of 'P'. Here, the first premise is 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled', and the second premise is 'The sprocket was cranked'. Therefore, we can infer 'The sprocket was daggled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
