If P, then Q.\n2. P.\n3. Therefore, Q.\n\nIn this case, 'If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled' is the conditional statement (1), and 'The zinger was fraggled' is the second statement (2). Given these two statements, we can indeed infer 'The zinger was smoogled' as it is the necessary consequence (3).\n\nAnswer: Yes."
