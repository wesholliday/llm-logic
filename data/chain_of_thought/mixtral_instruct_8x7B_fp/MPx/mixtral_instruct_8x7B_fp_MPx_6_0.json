            "content": "Explanation: This question is asking about logical deduction based on the given information. The first statement \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. It means that if the grommet being sploffed is true, then the consequence \"the grommet plopped the frink\" must also be true.\n\nThe second statement \"The grommet was sploffed\" is the condition of the first statement. Since this condition is true, it necessarily follows that the consequence of the first statement, \"the grommet plopped the frink,\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
