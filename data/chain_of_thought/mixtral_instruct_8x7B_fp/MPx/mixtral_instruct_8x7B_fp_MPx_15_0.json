            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened' is a conditional statement, also known as a hypothetical or \"if-then\" statement. It means that if the condition (the dreb was vroombed) is true, then the consequence (the dreb was spened) must also be true. The second statement given is 'The dreb was vroombed'. Since this statement matches the condition in the first statement, we can apply the rule of the conditional statement and conclude that the consequence 'The dreb was spened' must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
