In the given statement 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed', 'flug was blummed' is the hypothesis and 'flug was zimmed' is the conclusion. Given that the hypothesis is true (from 'The flug was blummed'), and the conditional statement is also true, then the conclusion 'The flug was zimmed' must be true as well.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
