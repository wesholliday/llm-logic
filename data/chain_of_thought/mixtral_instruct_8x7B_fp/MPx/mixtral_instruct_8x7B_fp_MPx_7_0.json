It means that if the condition (the whiffle was shanked) is true, then the consequence (the whiffle tinked) follows. The second statement is 'The whiffle was shanked', which is the condition part of the first statement. Since the condition is true, we can infer that the consequence, 'the whiffle tinked', is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
