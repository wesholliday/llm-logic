            "content": "Explanation: The phrase \"The zibble must be wozzle with wobble and snizzle plimp\" contains two independent clauses: \"The zibble must be wozzle with wobble\" and \"snizzle plimp\". The second clause doesn't affect the truth of the first clause, because they're connected by \"and\", which means both clauses must be true for the whole sentence to be true. Therefore, the truth of \"The zibble must be wozzle with wobble\" can be inferred independently from the rest of the sentence.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
