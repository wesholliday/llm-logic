However, the 'frazzle' and 'zooble zizz' could be connected or related in some way. Since the 'zizz' is in both of these entities, it can be inferred that 'The zizz must be in the frazzle'. The presence of 'zizz' in 'frazzle' is not negated by the presence of 'zizz' in 'zooble zizz'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
