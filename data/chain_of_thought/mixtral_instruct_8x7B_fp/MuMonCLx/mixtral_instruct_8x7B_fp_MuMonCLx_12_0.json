            "content": "Explanation: The phrase \"The wibble must be quork by fizzle and gribble frazzle\" includes two separate actions related to the wibble: it must be quork, and it must be done by fizzle. The 'and gribble frazzle' part refers to an additional action or participant in the situation, not modifying the requirement of who or what is causing the wibble to quork. Therefore, the requirement of 'The wibble must be quork by fizzle' can indeed be inferred from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
