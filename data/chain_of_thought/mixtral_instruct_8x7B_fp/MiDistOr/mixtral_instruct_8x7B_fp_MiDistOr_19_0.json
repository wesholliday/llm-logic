The original sentence omits the repeated phrase \"the application might be\" in the interests of brevity and easier reading. \n\nThe meaning of the original sentence is therefore identical to the expanded version, and it does indeed imply that \"The application might be completed online or it might be completed in person\".\n\nAnswer: Yes"
