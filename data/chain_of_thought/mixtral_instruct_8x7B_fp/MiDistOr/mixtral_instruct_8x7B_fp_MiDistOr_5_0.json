The first part of the sentence, \"The package might be delivered today,\" is one alternative, and the second part, \"it might be delivered tomorrow,\" is the other alternative. The sentence is saying that the package might be delivered today, or, as an alternative, it might be delivered tomorrow.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
