            "content": "Explanation: The phrase \"The exam might be difficult or easy\" is a contraction of \"The exam might be difficult or the exam might be easy.\" Both versions convey the same meaning: that there are two possible outcomes for the exam's difficulty level. The word \"or\" is a disjunctive conjunction, meaning it connects two ideas that are alternatives to each other. In this case, the two alternatives are \"difficult\" and \"easy.\" Therefore, the sentence implies that the exam could be either one or the other, but we cannot determine yet which one it will be.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
