            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The book might be on the shelf or in the library\" can be rephrased as \"The book might be (on the shelf or in the library)\". This means that there are two possible locations for the book - on the shelf or in the library. By expanding the abbreviated clause \"on the shelf or in the library\" into two separate options, we get \"The book might be on the shelf or it might be in the library\". This is because the word \"or\" is used to connect two distinct possibilities.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
