            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The room might be cleaned daily or on request\" contains the word \"or\", which indicates a choice between two options. The first option is \"daily\", and the second option is \"on request\". The word \"might\" indicates possibility, not certainty. So, the statement is saying that it is possible that the room is cleaned daily, and it is also possible that the room is cleaned upon request.\n\nThe statement does not specify that the room can only be cleaned in one of these ways. It is possible that the room is cleaned both daily and upon request. However, the statement also does not rule out this possibility. Therefore, the statement \"The room might be cleaned daily or on request\" does imply that \"The room might be cleaned daily or it might be cleaned upon request\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
