The phrase \"or notarized\" indicates that this is an additional possibility beyond simply being signed. \n\nWhen we break down the original statement into two separate possibilities, we get \"The document might be signed\" and \"The document might be notarized\". These are indeed two distinct scenarios that cover all potential situations.\n\nTherefore, yes, from the original statement, we can infer that \"The document might be signed or it might be notarized\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
