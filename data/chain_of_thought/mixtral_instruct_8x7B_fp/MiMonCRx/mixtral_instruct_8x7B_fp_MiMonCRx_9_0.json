            "content": "Explanation: The phrase 'The snorkel might be plimped and froodled' is composed of two independent clauses joined by the conjunction 'and'. The first clause is 'The snorkel might be plimped', and the second clause is 'froodled'. \n\nIn English grammar, when a conjunction connects two independent clauses, each clause can often stand alone as a complete sentence. This is the case here, where 'The snorkel might be froodled' is a grammatically complete sentence on its own.\n\nTherefore, if 'The snorkel might be plimped and froodled' is true, then it follows that 'The snorkel might be froodled' is also true, since it's one of the two independent clauses making up the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
