            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The quibble might be snorked and wumbled' is a conjunction of two possibilities: 'The quibble might be snorked' and 'The quibble might be wumbled'. A conjunction is a compound sentence joined by 'and', 'or', or 'but', where each clause could be a separate sentence on its own. Here, the 'and' is connecting two distinct possibilities. Therefore, the statement 'The quibble might be snorked and wumbled' does not imply that the quibble can't be only 'wumbled'. It's possible that the quibble might be just 'wumbled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
