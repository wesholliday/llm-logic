            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The wibble might be glorped and flimmed\" suggests that there are two possible outcomes for the wibble: it might be \"glorped\" and it might be \"flimmed\". The word \"and\" in this context indicates that these are two separate possibilities, not necessarily connected or dependent on each other. Therefore, the statement \"The wibble might be flimmed\" can be inferred from the original statement since it is one of the two possibilities presented.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
