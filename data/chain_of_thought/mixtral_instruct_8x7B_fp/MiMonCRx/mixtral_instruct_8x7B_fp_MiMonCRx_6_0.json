It does not explicitly state that the froodle cannot be both, but it also does not rule out this possibility. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The froodle might be crunked\". We can only say that \"The froodle might be wozzled\" and \"The froodle might be crunked\" are both possible scenarios.\n\nAnswer: No."
