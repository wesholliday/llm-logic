            "content": "Explanation: This question is a conditional statement based on the concept of logical reasoning, specifically using the concept of contrapositive. The original statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" is in the form of \"If P, then Q\". The second statement \"The splat was not morphed\" is the negation of P, or \"not P\". The contrapositive of the original statement is \"If not Q, then not P\". In this case, \"not Q\" would be \"The splat did not quank\".\n\nTherefore, if both the original statement and the second statement are true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
