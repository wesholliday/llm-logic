According to logical principles, if P implies Q is true, then the negation of P also implies the negation of Q. This is known as the contrapositive of the original implication.\n\nTherefore, if 'the wug was not flooped', we can infer 'the wug did not bim the zoint', because the negation of 'the wug was flooped' implies the negation of 'the wug bimmed the zoint'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
