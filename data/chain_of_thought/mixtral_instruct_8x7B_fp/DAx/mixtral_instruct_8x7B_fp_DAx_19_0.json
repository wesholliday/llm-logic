Modus tollens is a form of argument in classical logic, and it can be expressed as:\n\nP -> Q\n~Q\n-----------------\n~P\n\nHere, 'P' is 'the smonk was vreebled', 'Q' is 'the smonk plagged', '~' denotes negation, and '->' denotes implication.\n\nGiven 'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged' (P -> Q), and 'The smonk was not vreebled' (~P), we can infer 'The smonk was not plagged' (~Q) by applying modus tollens.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
