            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical reasoning, specifically whether we can make a certain deduction based on the given information. The statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled' is an example of a conditional statement, often referred to as 'if p, then q'. This statement means that the truth of 'p' (the sprocket being cranked) guarantees the truth of 'q' (the sprocket being daggled).\n\nHowever, the truth of 'not p' (the sprocket was not cranked) does not necessarily mean that 'q' (the sprocket was daggled) is false. It could be true or false. This is because the original conditional statement only guarantees 'q' when 'p' is true, not when 'p' is false.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The sprocket was not daggled'.\n\nAnswer: No."
