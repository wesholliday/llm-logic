            "content": "Explanation: This question is a logical reasoning problem that involves evaluating a conditional statement and its negation to determine if another statement can be inferred. The conditional statement 'If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished' can be written in logical notation as 'Plinked(t) -> Varnished(t)'. The negation of the second statement 'The twonk was not plinked' can be written as 'not Plinked(t)'.\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer 'not Varnished(t)' (The twonk was not varnished) from these two statements. To do this, we can use logical reasoning.\n\nFirst, let's consider the contrapositive of the conditional statement 'Plinked(t) -> Varnished(t)'. The contrapositive is 'not Varnished(t) -> not Plinked(t)'. This means that if the twonk was not varnished, then it was not plinked.\n\nNext, let's consider the second statement 'not Plinked(t)'. Since the contrapositive of the conditional statement tells us that 'not Plinked(t)' implies 'not Varnished(t)', we can infer that 'not Varnished(t)' is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'The twonk was not varnished'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
