            "content": "Explanation: This question is a application of logical reasoning, specifically Modus Tollens, which states that if p -> q is true, then ~q -> ~p is also true. In this case, the first statement \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" can be translated to \"If p, then q\". The second statement \"The grommet was not sploffed\" can be translated to \"~p\". Therefore, using Modus Tollens, we can infer \"The grommet did not plop the frink\" or \"~q\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
