            "content": "Explanation: This question involves applying principles of logical reasoning, specifically using a concept called contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. In this case, the original statement is 'If the whiffle was shanked (P), then the whiffle tinked (Q)'. The negation of this is 'If the whiffle did not tink (not Q), then the whiffle was not shanked (not P)'. Therefore, from 'The whiffle was not shanked', we can indeed infer 'The whiffle did not tink'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
