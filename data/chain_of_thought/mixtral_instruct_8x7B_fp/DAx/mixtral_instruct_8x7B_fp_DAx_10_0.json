            "content": "Explanation: This question involves logical reasoning, specifically using conditional statements and modus tollens, a form of logical argument. The statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garbled\" is a conditional statement, often denoted as \"If P then Q\". The second statement given is \"The wug was not sproinged\", denoted as \"not P\". Modus tollens states that if \"If P then Q\" is true, and \"not P\" is true, then \"not Q\" must be true. In this case, \"not Q\" is \"The wug was not garbled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
