            "content": "Explanation: This question is a application of logical reasoning, specifically using the concept of contrapositive. The original statement \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" can be written in logical form as:\n\ncrampled(sneg) -> sproted(sneg, frink)\n\nThe second statement \"The sneg was not crampled\" can be written as:\n\nnot(crampled(sneg))\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"The sneg did not sprot the frink\", which can be written as:\n\nnot(sproted(sneg, frink))\n\nFrom the original statement, we can form its contrapositive, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"crampled(sneg) -> sproted(sneg, frink)\" is \"not(sproted(sneg, frink)) -> not(crampled(sneg))\".\n\nSince we are given \"not(crampled(sneg))\", we can use the contrapositive to infer \"not(sproted(sneg, frink))\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
