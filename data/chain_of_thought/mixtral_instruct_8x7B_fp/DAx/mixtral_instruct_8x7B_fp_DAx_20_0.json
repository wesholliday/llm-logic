The contrapositive of a conditional statement is 'If ~Q then ~P'. \n\nIn this case, ~Q is 'The fleeg did not surn' and ~P is 'The fleeg was not bluttered'. \n\nSince we know ~P is true, and the original conditional statement is true, then ~Q (The fleeg did not surn) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
