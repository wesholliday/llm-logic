            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical reasoning, specifically whether we can make a certain deduction based on the given information. The given information consists of two statements:\n\n1. If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\n2. The clug was not fleeked.\n\nWe want to determine if we can conclude that the clug was not snugged. To do this, we need to consider the logical relationship between the given statements and the statement we want to infer.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, often written in the form \"if P, then Q\". This statement tells us that if the clug was fleeked (P), then the clug snugged (Q). It does not tell us that fleeking always leads to snugging, only that if fleeking occurs, then snugging will also occur.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the clug was not fleeked (not P). Given this information, we cannot directly determine whether the clug snugged (Q) or not, because the first statement only tells us what happens when the clug is fleeked, not when it is not fleeked.\n\nHowever, in this case, we are given that the clug was not fleeked and the first statement is in the form \"if P, then Q\". This specific form of conditional statement allows us to make a logical deduction using the concept of contrapositive. The contrapositive of \"if P, then Q\" is \"if not Q, then not P\". In this case, the contrapositive would be \"if the clug did not snug, then the clug was not fleeked\".\n\nSince we know that the clug was not fleeked (not P), and the contrapositive tells us that if the clug was not snugged (not Q), then the clug would not be fleeked (not P), we can infer that the clug was not snugged (not Q).\n\nAnswer: Yes."
