            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened' is a conditional statement, also known as a hypothetical or \"if-then\" statement. It means that if the condition (the dreb was vroombed) is true, then the consequence (the dreb was spened) must also be true. However, it does not say anything about what happens when the condition is false.\n\nIn this case, we are given that the dreb was not vroombed. Since the truth of the consequence only depends on the truth of the condition, and the condition is false, we cannot make any conclusions about the truth or falsehood of the consequence.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that 'The dreb was not spened' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No."
