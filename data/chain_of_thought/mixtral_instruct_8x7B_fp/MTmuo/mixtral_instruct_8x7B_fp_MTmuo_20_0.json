            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow\" means that the banana could have been some other color than yellow. This implies that there is some scenario where the banana is not yellow.\n\nThe second statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the consequence (the banana being yellow) must also be true.\n\nHowever, the first statement tells us that there is a scenario where the banana is not yellow, which contradicts the consequence of the second statement. Therefore, the condition of the second statement (the apple being red) cannot be true.\n\nSo, we can infer that \"The apple was not red\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
