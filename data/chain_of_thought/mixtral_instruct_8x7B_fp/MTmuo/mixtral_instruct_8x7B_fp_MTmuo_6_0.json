If Sue did indeed choose pizza, then it would follow that Bob had to choose pasta.\n\nHowever, since we know from the first statement that Bob did not necessarily choose pasta, it follows that Sue also could not have chosen pizza. If she had, then Bob would have had to choose pasta, but we know that's not the case. Therefore, Sue must have chosen something other than pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
