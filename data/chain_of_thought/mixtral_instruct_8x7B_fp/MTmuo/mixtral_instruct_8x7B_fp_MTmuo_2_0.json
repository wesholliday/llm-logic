However, we know from the first statement that it's possible that the unicorn was not in the forest. This creates a contradiction, which means this scenario (the griffin being in the forest) is unlikely.\n\nb) If the griffin was not in the forest, then the second statement does not apply, and the first statement's situation about the unicorn becomes irrelevant.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The griffin was not in the forest'.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
