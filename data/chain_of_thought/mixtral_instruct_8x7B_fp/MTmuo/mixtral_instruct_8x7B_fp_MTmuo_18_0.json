It only tells us that it's possible the truck wasn't metal and that if the doll were plastic, the truck would be metal. \n\nWithout further information, we cannot definitively conclude that the doll was not plastic. The provided statements do not form a contradiction with the idea that the doll is not plastic.\n\nAnswer: No."
