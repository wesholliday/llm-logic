            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis\" means that Amy playing tennis is not a certainty, but it's possible that she did not play tennis. The second statement, \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis,\" means that if we know for sure that Jeff played basketball, then we can infer that Amy also played tennis. However, since we don't know for certain that Amy played tennis, this implies that Jeff probably did not play basketball. If Jeff had played basketball, then Amy would have had to play tennis, but since we know Amy didn't play tennis, Jeff couldn't have played basketball either.\nAnswer: Yes"
