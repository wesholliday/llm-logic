            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad' means that it is possible that Kate did not eat salad. If Kate did not eat salad, then from the second statement 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad', it follows that Ben could not have eaten pasta. This is because if Ben had eaten pasta, then Kate would have had to eat salad, but we know that Kate did not eat salad. Therefore, Ben could not have eaten pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
