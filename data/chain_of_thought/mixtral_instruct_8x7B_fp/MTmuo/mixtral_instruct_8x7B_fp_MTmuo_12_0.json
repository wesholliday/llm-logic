If the condition (Joe went to the park) is true, then the consequence (Lucy must have gone to the zoo) is also true.\n\nGiven these two statements, if Lucy did not go to the zoo, then the condition of the second statement cannot be true. Therefore, we can infer that 'Joe did not go to the park'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
