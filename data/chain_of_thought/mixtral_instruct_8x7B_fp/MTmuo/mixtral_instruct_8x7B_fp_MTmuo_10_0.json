If the cat being outside is not a certainty, then it leaves room for the possibility that the cat was inside.\n\nThe second statement, \"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside\", is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the dog was inside, then the cat had to be outside.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that the dog was not inside. This is because, if the dog were inside, then the cat would have to be outside (from the second statement). But we know from the first statement that it's possible that the cat was inside. Therefore, the dog cannot be inside, because if it were, the cat would have to be outside, which contradicts the information we have that the cat might have been inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
