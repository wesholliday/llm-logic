If the condition (the shirt being cotton) is true, then the consequence (the pants being denim) must also be true.\n\nNow let's think about the possibility of the shirt being not cotton. If the shirt is not cotton, then the condition in the second statement is false. This means that the second statement doesn't apply, and we can't make any conclusions based on it.\n\nHowever, the first statement tells us that the pants could be any material other than denim. This doesn't require the shirt to be a specific material. Therefore, the truth of the first statement doesn't depend on the material of the shirt.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that \"The shirt was not cotton\" based on the given information."
