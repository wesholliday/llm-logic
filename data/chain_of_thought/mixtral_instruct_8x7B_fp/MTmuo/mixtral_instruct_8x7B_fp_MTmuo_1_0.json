            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding,\" means that it is possible that Sue was not at the wedding. The second statement, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding,\" is a conditional statement that only applies if Mary was at the wedding. \n\nIf we assume the second statement is true and Mary was at the wedding, then it would indeed follow that Sue must have been at the wedding. However, the first statement tells us that it's possible Sue was not at the wedding. Therefore, the second statement cannot be true, and so Mary must not have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
