            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, 'It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train', implies that Erin could have taken some other mode of transportation or possibly took no transportation at all.\n\nThe second statement, 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train', is a conditional statement. If Sam did take a plane, then the consequence is that Erin had to take a train.\n\nHowever, the first statement tells us that Erin did not have to take a train. Therefore, the condition in the second statement cannot be true, i.e., Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
