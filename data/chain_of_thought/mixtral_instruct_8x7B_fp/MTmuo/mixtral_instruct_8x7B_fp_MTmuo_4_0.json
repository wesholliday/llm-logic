It does not definitively say that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nThe second statement, 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter', is a conditional statement. It only applies if the condition (the alien visiting Mars) is true.\n\nHowever, since we do not know if the alien visited Mars or not, we cannot use this statement to infer anything about the alien's visit to Mars.\n\nAnswer: No."
