This doesn't necessarily mean that the wolf was not in the den, but there is a possibility that it wasn't.\n\nThe second statement, 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den', is a conditional statement. If the condition (the bear being in the cave) is true, then the consequence (the wolf being in the den) must also be true.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot directly infer that 'The bear was not in the cave'. The first statement only tells us that it's possible that the wolf was not in the den, and the second statement tells us about a relationship between the bear being in the cave and the wolf being in the den, but it doesn't tell us anything about whether the bear was actually in the cave or not.\n\nAnswer: No."
