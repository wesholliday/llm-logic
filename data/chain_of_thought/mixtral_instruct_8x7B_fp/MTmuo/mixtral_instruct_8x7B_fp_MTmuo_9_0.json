            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, 'It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt', means that Mark buying the blue shirt is not a certainty. This implies that Mark could have bought other shirts or not bought any shirt at all.\n\nThe second statement, 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt', is a conditional statement. If Lisa did buy the red shirt, then Mark would have to buy the blue shirt.\n\nHowever, since we know from the first statement that Mark buying the blue shirt is not a certainty, this implies that Lisa probably did not buy the red shirt. If Lisa had bought the red shirt, then Mark would have had to buy the blue shirt, but since Mark didn't buy the blue shirt (as we inferred from the first statement), Lisa therefore did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
