If the mummy could be awake or not awake, then the first statement doesn't give us any information about the vampire's state.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the second statement is true, then the vampire being awake would mean the mummy must be awake. But since the first statement tells us that it's possible for the mummy to be not awake, this implies that the vampire cannot be awake to avoid contradiction.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
