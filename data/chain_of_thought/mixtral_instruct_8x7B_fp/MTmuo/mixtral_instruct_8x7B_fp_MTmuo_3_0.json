This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the book was written by James) is true, then the conclusion (the book must be a mystery novel) must also be true.\n\nHowever, the first statement tells us that \"it's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel\". This means that the book is not necessarily a mystery novel, and it could be any other genre.\n\nTherefore, if the book is not necessarily a mystery novel, then it cannot be true that the book must be a mystery novel if it was written by James. This contradicts the second statement.\n\nThe only way to resolve this contradiction is to conclude that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
