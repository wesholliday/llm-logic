            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball,\" means that there is a possibility that Jen did not watch basketball. This doesn't necessarily mean that she definitely didn't watch basketball, but rather that it's possible she didn't.\n\nThe second statement, \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball,\" is a conditional statement. If the condition (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequence (Jen must have watched basketball) follows.\n\nNow, let's consider the two statements together. The first statement tells us that it's possible Jen didn't watch basketball. But the second statement tells us that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. If Jen didn't watch basketball (which is possible according to the first statement), then Tom couldn't have watched football. This is because if Tom had watched football, then Jen would have had to watch basketball, but we know that's not the case.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
