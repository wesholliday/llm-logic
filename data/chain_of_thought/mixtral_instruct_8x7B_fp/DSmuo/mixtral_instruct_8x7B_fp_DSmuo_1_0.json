            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" means that it is not necessary for Fido to be in the garden; he could be somewhere else. The second statement, \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden,\" is a logical disjunction that tells us that Fido is either inside or he has to be in the garden.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can indeed infer that Fido is inside. This is because the first statement tells us that Fido doesn't have to be in the garden, and the second statement then gives us the only two possibilities for Fido's location: he is inside, or he must be in the garden. Since the first statement rules out the second possibility, Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
