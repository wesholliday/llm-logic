            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" means that it is not necessary or a requirement for the sunglasses to be on her head. The second statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" is a logical disjunction, meaning at least one of the two parts must be true. \n\nGiven that the second part of this disjunction is not true (because we know from the first statement that the sunglasses do not have to be on her head), it must mean that the first part is true. Therefore, the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
