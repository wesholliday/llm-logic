            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, 'It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge', implies that it's possible for the milk not to be in the fridge. The second statement, 'Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge', is a logical disjunction, meaning at least one of the two parts must be true. \n\nIf the second statement is true, and it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge (as per the first statement), then the only possibility left is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
