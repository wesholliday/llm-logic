This is different from saying that the jacket is definitely not in the closet. \n\nThe second statement \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" presents two possibilities: either the jacket is draped over the chair, or it must be hanging in the closet. \n\nGiven that it's possible for the jacket to not be in the closet, as stated in the first statement, and knowing that the only other option, according to the second statement, is for the jacket to be draped over the chair, we can infer that the jacket is indeed draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
