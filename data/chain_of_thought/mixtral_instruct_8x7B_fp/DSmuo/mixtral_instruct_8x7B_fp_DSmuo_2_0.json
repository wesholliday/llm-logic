            "content": "Explanation: The first statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" implies that it is possible for the book to not be on the table. The second statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" presents two possibilities: either the book is on the shelf, or it must be on the table. Given that we know from the first statement that it's possible for the book to not be on the table, it follows that the book must be on the shelf. This is a form of logical reasoning called disjunctive syllogism.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
