They do not explicitly state that if the package is delivered, it will be damaged, nor do they state that it will be damaged on the day of delivery. Therefore, combining these statements to infer that \"The package might be delivered damaged today\" is a logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\"\n\nAnswer: No."
