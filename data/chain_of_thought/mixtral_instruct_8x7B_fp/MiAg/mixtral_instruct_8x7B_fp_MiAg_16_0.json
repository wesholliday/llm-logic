These two clauses are connected by the word 'and', which means both conditions could occur independently of one another.\n\nWhen we remove the repeated word 'plane' and combine the two statements, as in 'The plane might be delayed and experiencing turbulence', we are not changing the meaning of the original statement. We're simply using a more concise form. The word 'and' still indicates that these are separate possibilities.\n\nTherefore, this transformation does not introduce any new information or change the meaning of the original statement. It's merely a stylistic variation.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
