Each clause is a separate possibility, and they are not necessarily connected. However, it is possible for the restaurant to be both expensive and busy, so the compound statement 'The restaurant might be expensive and busy' is a possible inference, but not a certainty based on the original statement alone.\nAnswer: Yes."
