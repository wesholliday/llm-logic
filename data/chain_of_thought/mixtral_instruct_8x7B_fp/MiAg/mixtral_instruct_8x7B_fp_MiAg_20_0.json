These two statements suggest that the scientist could be present in the lab and could also be engaged in an experiment. However, they do not explicitly state that the experiment is being conducted in the lab.\n\nHowever, if we consider the common scenario where scientific experiments are conducted in labs, it is reasonable to infer that 'The scientist might be conducting an experiment in the lab'. This inference is based on general knowledge and common practice in the field of science.\n\nAnswer: Yes, based on general knowledge and common practice in the field of science, we can infer that 'The scientist might be conducting an experiment in the lab'."
