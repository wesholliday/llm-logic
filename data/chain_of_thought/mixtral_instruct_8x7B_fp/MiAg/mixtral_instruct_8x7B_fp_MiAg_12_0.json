            "content": "Explanation: The sentence \"The computer might be on and the computer might be running a virus scan\" contains two separate clauses: \"The computer might be on\" and \"the computer might be running a virus scan.\" Both of these clauses are joined by the conjunction \"and.\" Since the two clauses are independent of each other, we can combine them into a single sentence using the same conjunction. This results in the sentence \"The computer might be on and running a virus scan,\" which is a valid inference based on the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
