            "content": "Explanation: The original statements \"The envelope might be upstairs\" and \"The envelope might be under a bed\" are separate possibilities, not connected in any way. The phrase \"under a bed\" doesn't specify which bed, so it could be a bed upstairs, but it could also be a bed in the basement or any other room. Without further information, we can't assume that the envelope can't be both \"upstairs\" and \"under a bed,\" but the original statements don't imply that it is.\n\nAnswer: No."
