The statement \"The flowers might be wilting\" means that there is a possibility that the flowers are wilting, regardless of their location. When considering these two statements together, it is possible that the wilting flowers are located in the vase. This is because the wilting of the flowers is not dependent on where they are, only that they are wilting. Therefore, the statement \"The flowers might be wilting in the vase\" is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
