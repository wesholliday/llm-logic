            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement, also known as a \"if-then\" statement. This statement only tells us that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the consequence (the banana being yellow) must also be true. However, it does not tell us anything about what happens when the condition is false.\n\nThe second statement \"the banana was yellow\" is consistent with the consequence of the first statement, but it does not necessarily mean that the condition of the first statement is true. In other words, just because the banana was yellow, it does not mean that the apple had to be red.\n\nThere could be other reasons why the banana was yellow, such as it naturally being yellow or being ripe. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the apple was red.\n\nAnswer: No."
