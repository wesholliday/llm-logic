Here's why: the statement \"if the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is a conditional statement that tells us if James wrote the book, it's a mystery novel. However, the second statement \"the book is a mystery novel\" doesn't necessarily mean James wrote it. There could be other mystery novel authors. Therefore, from these two statements alone, we cannot infer that the book was written by James.\n\nAnswer: No."
