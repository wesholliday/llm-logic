We have two statements:\n   - If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n   - The wolf was in the den.\n\n2. To determine if we can infer that the bear was in the cave, we need to see if the second statement (the wolf was in the den) is sufficient to prove the first statement (if the bear was in the cave).\n\n3. However, even though the second statement is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that the first statement is also true. The fact that the wolf was in the den doesn't give us any information about whether the bear was in the cave or not.\n\nAnswer: No."
