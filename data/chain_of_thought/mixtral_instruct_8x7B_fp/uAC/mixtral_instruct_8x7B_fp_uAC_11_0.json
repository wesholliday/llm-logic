The muffins were blueberry.\n\n2. To determine if the cake was chocolate, we need to see if the second statement (that the muffins were blueberry) fits with the condition of the first statement (if the cake was chocolate).\n3. It does - the condition that if the cake was chocolate then the muffins were blueberry is met by the fact that the muffins were indeed blueberry.\n4. However, even though the condition is met, this doesn't necessarily mean that the cake was chocolate. It's possible that the cake was chocolate, but it's also possible that the cake was some other flavor. The first statement only tells us what would be true if the cake were chocolate, not that it definitely is chocolate.\n\nAnswer: No."
