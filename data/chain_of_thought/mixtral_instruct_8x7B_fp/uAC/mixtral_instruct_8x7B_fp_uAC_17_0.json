However, just because Kate ate salad, it doesn't necessarily mean that Ben ate pasta. It's possible that Ben ate pasta, but it's also possible that he ate something else. The statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" does not require that Ben must have eaten pasta, only that if he did, Kate would have eaten salad. So we cannot definitively say that Ben ate pasta.\n\nAnswer: No."
