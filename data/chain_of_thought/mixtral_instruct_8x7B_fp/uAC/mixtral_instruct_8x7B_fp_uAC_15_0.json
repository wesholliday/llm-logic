However, the information given does not indicate whether Sam taking a plane is a condition for Erin taking a train, or if it just happened to be the case this time. In other words, we don't know if Sam's mode of transportation (plane) was the cause of Erin's transportation (train). Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively say that Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: No."
