However, this doesn't necessarily mean that Lisa's purchase of the red shirt caused Mark to buy the blue shirt. It could be that Mark decided to buy the blue shirt independently of Lisa's actions.\n\nBut let's consider the information we have:\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n2. Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that when condition A (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then condition B (Mark buying the blue shirt) is also true. \n\nFrom statement 2, we know that condition B is indeed true. \n\nGiven these two facts, it follows that condition A must also be true. Therefore, we can logically infer that Lisa did buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
