However, even though the first statement implies a relationship between the doll and the truck, it does not mean that the reverse is also true. That is, just because the truck is metal, we cannot definitively say that the doll is plastic. It is possible, but we cannot infer it solely based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
