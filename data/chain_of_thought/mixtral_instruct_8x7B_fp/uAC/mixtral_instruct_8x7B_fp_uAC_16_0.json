We want to determine if we can conclude that the shirt was cotton.\n\nTo make this conclusion, we need to ensure that the given information supports it directly or indirectly. In this case, the fact that the pants were denim does not necessarily imply that the shirt was cotton. The first piece of information provides a conditional statement (if...then), but it does not have to be true in reality.\n\nAnswer: No."
