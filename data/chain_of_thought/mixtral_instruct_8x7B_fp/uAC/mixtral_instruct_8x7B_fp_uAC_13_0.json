Second, the truck was blue. \n\nFrom the second piece of information, we know for certain that the truck was blue. \n\nNow let's look at the first piece of information. It tells us that if the car was red, then the truck would be blue. But we already know from the second piece of information that the truck is blue. \n\nTherefore, all conditions for the first statement are met, so it is entirely possible that the car is indeed red. \n\nAnswer: Yes."
