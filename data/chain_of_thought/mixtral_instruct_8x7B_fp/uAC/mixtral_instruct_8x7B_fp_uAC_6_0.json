However, even though we know Bob's choice, this doesn't necessarily mean we know Sue's choice. The statement \"if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" does not work in reverse. It's possible that Sue chose pizza, but it's also possible that she chose something else and Bob still chose pasta. Without more information, we cannot definitively say what Sue chose.\n\nAnswer: No."
