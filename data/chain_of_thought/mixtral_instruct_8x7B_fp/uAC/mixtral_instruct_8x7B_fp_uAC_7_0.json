            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of logical reasoning using transitive property, where if A implies B and B is true, then A must be true. In this case, the statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" implies that if Alex did finish the race (A), it would result in Chris finishing the race (B). The subsequent information given is that Chris did indeed finish the race (B). Given this, it can be inferred that Alex must have finished the race as well (A), following the logical structure of the initial statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
