It does not definitively state that the sprocket was not cranked, but rather leaves it open to that possibility. \n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been cranked\" means that it is possible that the sprocket was not cranked, which is consistent with the first statement. \n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been cranked\" from \"The sprocket might not have been cranked\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
