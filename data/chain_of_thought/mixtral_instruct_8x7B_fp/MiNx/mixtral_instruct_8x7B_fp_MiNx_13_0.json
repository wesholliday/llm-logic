This is equivalent to saying that it is not certain or necessary that the glip was slogged. \n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged\" is denying the necessity of the glip being slogged. Both statements are negating the certainty or necessity of the glip being slogged, but they are phrased differently.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer \"It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged\" from \"The glip might not have been slogged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes."
