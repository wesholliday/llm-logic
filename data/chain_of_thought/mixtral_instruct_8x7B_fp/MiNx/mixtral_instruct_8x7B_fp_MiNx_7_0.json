This is equivalent to saying that it is not necessary that the whiffle was shanked. \n\nThe negation of \"it is necessary that the whiffle was shanked\" is \"it is not the case that the whiffle was necessarily shanked\" or \"it is possible that the whiffle was not shanked\". \n\nSo, yes, we can infer \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked\" from \"The whiffle might not have been shanked\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
