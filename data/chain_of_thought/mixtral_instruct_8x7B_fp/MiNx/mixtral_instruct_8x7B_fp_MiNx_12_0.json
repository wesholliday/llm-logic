It implies that there is a possibility or doubt that the action did not occur.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the smip must have been shripped\" is negating the necessity of the action \"must have been shripped\". This implies that there is no requirement or obligation for the action to have occurred.\n\nWhile these two statements have different meanings, they both convey a sense of uncertainty or negation regarding the action \"has been shripped\". Therefore, we can infer that the first statement implies the second one.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
