It's not definitively saying that the flug was not blummed, but it's expressing uncertainty or possibility of it not being blummed. \n\nOn the other hand, \"It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed\" is a roundabout way of saying that it's possible that the flug was not blummed. \n\nThese two statements are expressing the same idea, just in slightly different ways. Both are negating the certainty of the flug being blummed and introducing the possibility that it was not. \n\nTherefore, yes, from \"The flug might not have been blummed\", we can infer \"It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed\".\n\nAnswer: Yes"
