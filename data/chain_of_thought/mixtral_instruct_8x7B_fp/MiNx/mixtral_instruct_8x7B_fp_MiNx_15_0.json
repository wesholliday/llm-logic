This is similar to saying \"It's possible that the dreb was not vroombed.\" \n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been vroombed\" is equivalent to saying \"It's possible that the dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nSince both statements convey the same idea, we can infer that \"The dreb might not have been vroombed\" implies \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes."
