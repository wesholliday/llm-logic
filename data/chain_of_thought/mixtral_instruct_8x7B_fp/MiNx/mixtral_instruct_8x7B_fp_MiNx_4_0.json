            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The fribble might not have been snurgled\" is negating the fact that the fribble was definitely snurgled. Instead, it's suggesting that there's a possibility that the fribble was not snurgled. This aligns with the logical negation of the statement \"the fribble must have been snurgled\", which would be \"it's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled\". Both statements express uncertainty about the fribble having been snurgled, with the original statement implying it's possible it wasn't, and the second statement explicitly stating that it's not necessarily true that it was.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
