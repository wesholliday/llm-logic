It's implying that there's a possibility or chance that the sneg was not crampled. \n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled\" is saying that it's possible that the sneg was not crampled, which is the same as saying there's a possibility that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nSince both statements convey the same meaning, we can infer one from the other.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
