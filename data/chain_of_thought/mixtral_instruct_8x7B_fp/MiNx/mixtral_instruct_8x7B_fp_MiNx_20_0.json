It implies that there is a possibility that the fleeg was not bluttered. \n\nOn the other hand, \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered\" is saying that it's not necessary that the fleeg was bluttered.\n\nThese two statements have similar meanings but they are not exactly the same. However, they both convey the idea that there is a possibility that the fleeg was not bluttered. \n\nTherefore, while the two statements are not logically equivalent, the first statement does imply the second one in the context of this question.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
