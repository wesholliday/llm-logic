It suggests that there is a possibility or chance that the flob was not skizzled. \n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled\" is saying that it is not necessary for the flob to have been skizzled, leaving room for the possibility that it wasn't skizzled.\n\nThese two statements convey the same idea, that there is a possibility that the flob was not skizzled. Therefore, from \"The flob might not have been skizzled\", we can infer \"It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes"
