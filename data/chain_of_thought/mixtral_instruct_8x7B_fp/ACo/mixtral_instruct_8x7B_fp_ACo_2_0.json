To infer 'The griffin was in the forest', we would need to have information directly indicating its presence or a logical connection that allows us to deduce its presence.\n\nIn this case, the only given information about the griffin is the conditional statement, which does not provide any new information about the griffin's location. It only states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn would also be there. However, we already know that the unicorn is in the forest, so this conditional statement doesn't help us conclude anything about the griffin's location.\n\nAnswer: No."
