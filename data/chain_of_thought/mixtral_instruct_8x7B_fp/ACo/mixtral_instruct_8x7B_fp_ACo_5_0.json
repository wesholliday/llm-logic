            "content": "Explanation:  The statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis' is known as a conditional statement. It means that if the condition (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the result (Amy playing tennis) must also be true. However, it does not work the other way around. Even if Amy played tennis, it does not necessarily mean that Jeff played basketball. It's possible that Jeff played basketball and Amy played tennis, but it's also possible that Amy played tennis for some other reason. Therefore, from 'Amy played tennis' alone, we cannot infer 'Jeff played basketball'.\n\nAnswer: No."
