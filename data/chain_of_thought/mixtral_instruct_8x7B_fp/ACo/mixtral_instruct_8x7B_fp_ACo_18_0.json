            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The truck was metal' is a single piece of information and doesn't necessarily relate to the doll's material yet. However, the second statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' is a conditional statement where the 'if' part (the condition) is 'the doll was plastic'. Given that this condition matches the 'yes' answer we're looking for, let's consider the truck being metal as a given fact. In this case, the second statement indeed confirms that if the condition (doll being plastic) is true, then the truck being metal is also true. Therefore, based on this given information, we can infer that the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
