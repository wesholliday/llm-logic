If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the bear was in the cave) is true, then the consequence (the wolf was in the den) must also be true.\n\nHowever, the truth of the consequence alone does not guarantee the truth of the condition. It's possible that the wolf was in the den for some reason other than the bear being in the cave.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that 'The bear was in the cave'.\n\nAnswer: No."
