            "content": "Explanation:  The statement 'The pants were denim' is a standalone fact that doesn't depend on any conditions. However, the statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim' is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim, but it doesn't tell us anything about what happens when the shirt is not cotton.\n\nGiven the information we have, we cannot directly infer that 'The shirt was cotton'. It could be the case, but it could also be that the shirt is not cotton. For example, if the shirt is wool, the pants could still be denim according to the given conditional statement. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The shirt was cotton'.\n\nAnswer: No."
