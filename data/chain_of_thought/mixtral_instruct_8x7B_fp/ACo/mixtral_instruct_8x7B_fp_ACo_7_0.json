This statement only allows us to make conclusions when the condition (Alex finishing the race) is met. However, the statement 'Chris finished the race' does not provide enough information to determine if Alex finished the race as well. It's possible that Chris finished the race for some other reason, not related to Alex's performance. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Alex finishes the race' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No."
