Given the two statements 'The muffins were blueberry' and 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry', we want to determine if we can conclude that 'The cake was chocolate'.\n\nTo make this inference, we need to consider whether the second statement 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' could only be true if 'The cake was chocolate'. In other words, is it possible for the muffins to be blueberry for some other reason?\n\nWithout additional information, we cannot rule out the possibility that the muffins were blueberry for reasons unrelated to the cake. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The cake was chocolate'.\n\nAnswer: No."
