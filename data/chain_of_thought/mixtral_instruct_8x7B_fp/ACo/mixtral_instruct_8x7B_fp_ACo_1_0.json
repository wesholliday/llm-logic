Sue was at the wedding.\n2. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n\nFrom the second statement, we can infer that Sue's presence at the wedding is dependent on Mary's presence. In other words, if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue had to be there as well.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not necessarily mean that Mary's presence is sufficient for Sue's presence. It's possible that Sue could be at the wedding for reasons other than Mary's presence.\n\nGiven only the first statement, Sue's presence at the wedding, we cannot definitively conclude that Mary was at the wedding. Therefore, we cannot make the inference 'Mary was at the wedding' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No."
