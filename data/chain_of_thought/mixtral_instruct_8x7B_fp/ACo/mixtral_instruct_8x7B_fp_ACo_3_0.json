This is when we have two statements, if A implies B and B implies C, then we can infer that A implies C. \n\nIn this case, we have:\n1. The book is a mystery novel (let's call this statement B)\n2. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (let's call this statement A)\n\nWe want to find out if we can infer:\n3. The book was written by James (let's call this statement C)\n\nFrom the given statements, we know that if the book is a mystery novel (B), then it was written by James (A). We also know that if the book was written by James (A), then it is a mystery novel (B). Therefore, we can use transitive inference to say that if the book is a mystery novel (B), then it was written by James (C).\n\nAnswer:  Yes."
