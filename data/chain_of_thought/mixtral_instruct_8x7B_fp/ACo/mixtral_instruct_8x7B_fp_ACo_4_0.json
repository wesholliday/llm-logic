We also know that there is a conditional statement: If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the alien visited Mars, we need to see if the given facts align with the condition for that conclusion. According to the second statement, the robot visiting Jupiter only happens when the alien has visited Mars. Since we know the robot did visit Jupiter, it must be true that the alien visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
