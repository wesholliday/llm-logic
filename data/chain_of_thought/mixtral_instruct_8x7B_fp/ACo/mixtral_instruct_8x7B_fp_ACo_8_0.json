It means that the condition (the vampire being awake) leads to a consequence (the mummy being awake).\n\nHowever, this statement doesn't necessarily mean that the vampire's wakefulness is the only condition for the mummy's wakefulness. There could be other conditions as well.\n\nThe statement 'The mummy was awake' only confirms that the mummy was awake, but it doesn't provide any information about the vampire's state.\n\nWithout further information, we cannot infer that 'The vampire was awake'.\n\nAnswer: No."
