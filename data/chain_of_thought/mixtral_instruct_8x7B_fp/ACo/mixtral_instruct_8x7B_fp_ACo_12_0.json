It means that the truth of the second part (Lucy went to the zoo) depends on the truth of the first part (Joe went to the park).\n\nHowever, the statement 'Lucy went to the zoo' by itself does not necessarily mean that 'Joe went to the park'.  It's possible that Joe did go to the park and triggered the situation where Lucy went to the zoo, but it's also possible that Lucy went to the zoo for some other reason.  Without additional information, we cannot definitively say that Joe went to the park.\n\nAnswer: No."
