            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information given. First, we know that Mark bought the blue shirt. Second, we have an conditional statement that says if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. \n\nThe crucial point here is to understand that the condition 'If Lisa bought the red shirt' does not necessarily have to be true for the conclusion 'Mark bought the blue shirt' to be true. In other words, Mark buying the blue shirt doesn't imply that Lisa bought the red shirt. The conditional statement only tells us that Mark buying the blue shirt is a possible outcome if Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nHowever, the statement doesn't exclude other possibilities of how Mark could have bought the blue shirt. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: No."
