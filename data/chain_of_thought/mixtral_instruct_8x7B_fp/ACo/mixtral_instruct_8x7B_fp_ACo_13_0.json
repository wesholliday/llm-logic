We know that 'the truck was blue' and 'if the car was red, then the truck was blue'. The second statement is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. \n\nTo use this information to conclude that the car was red, we would need to have a guarantee that the color of the car is the only factor that determines the color of the truck. However, the given conditional statement does not provide enough information to make this assumption. It only tells us that if the car were red, then the truck would be blue. It does not exclude other possibilities where the truck could be blue even if the car is not red.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that the car was red.\n\nAnswer: No."
