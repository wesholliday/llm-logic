We know that 'Kate ate salad' and there's a conditional statement saying 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad'. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'Ben ate pasta', we need to see if the truth of 'Kate ate salad' implies the truth of 'Ben ate pasta'. However, according to the conditional statement, it only tells us that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. It doesn't necessarily mean that Ben eating pasta is the only condition for Kate to eat salad.\n\nAnswer: No."
