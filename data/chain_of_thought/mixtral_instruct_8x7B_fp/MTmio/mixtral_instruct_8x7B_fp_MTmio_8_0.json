The statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake' is a conditional statement. Its contrapositive is 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake'. \n\nThe first statement given is 'The mummy might not have been awake', which implies that it's possible the mummy was not awake. If we take this as true, then according to the contrapositive of the second statement, it must be true that 'The vampire was not awake'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
