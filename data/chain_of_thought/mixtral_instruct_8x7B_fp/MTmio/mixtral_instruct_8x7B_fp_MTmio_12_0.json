Lucy might not have gone to the zoo: This statement means that there's a possibility that Lucy did not go to the zoo, but it doesn't definitively say she didn't.\n\n2. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo: This is a conditional statement, implying that if Joe's action (going to the park) occurred, then Lucy's action (going to the zoo) should also have occurred.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that 'Joe did not go to the park'. The first statement only introduces uncertainty about Lucy's whereabouts. Even if Lucy didn't go to the zoo, it doesn't necessarily mean Joe didn't go to the park. There could be other reasons why Lucy didn't go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: No."
