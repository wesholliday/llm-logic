This statement implies that there's a possibility that the cat was inside.\n\nSecond, we have the conditional statement 'If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside'. This means that if the dog was in the house, the cat could not have been outside; it would have to be in the house as well.\n\nHowever, since we already know that 'The cat might not have been outside', this implies that the cat could have been inside, which contradicts the condition that if the dog was inside, the cat must have been outside. Therefore, the dog cannot be inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
