            "content": "Explanation:  The given statements are:\n1. The unicorn might not have been in the forest. This statement implies uncertainty about the unicorn's presence in the forest, it could be true or false.\n2. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest. This is a conditional statement where the presence of the griffin in the forest guarantees the presence of the unicorn in the forest.\n\nHowever, the truth of the first statement does not affect the truth value of the second statement. Even if we're unsure whether the unicorn was in the forest, it doesn't necessarily mean the griffin wasn't there. We cannot infer 'The griffin was not in the forest' based on these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: No."
