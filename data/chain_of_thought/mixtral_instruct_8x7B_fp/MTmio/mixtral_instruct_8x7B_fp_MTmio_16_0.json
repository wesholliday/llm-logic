            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the information given. \n\n1. The pants might not have been denim: This statement implies that the pants could be any material other than denim. It doesn't rule out cotton pants.\n\n2. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim: This is a conditional statement. If the condition (the shirt being cotton) is true, then the consequence (the pants being denim) must also be true. However, if the condition is not true, we cannot draw any conclusions about the consequence.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot infer that 'The shirt was not cotton'. The first statement tells us nothing about the material of the shirt. The second statement only tells us that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. If the pants are not denim, this doesn't negate the possibility of a cotton shirt. It just means we don't have enough information to determine the material of the pants.\n\nAnswer: No."
