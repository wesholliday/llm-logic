            "content": "Explanation: Let's consider the two statements given:\n\n1. Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. This statement implies that there is a possibility that Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, but it doesn't definitively say that he didn't.\n\n2. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This is a conditional statement, implying that if Lisa's action (buying the red shirt) occurred, then Mark's action (buying the blue shirt) would definitely have occurred.\n\nHowever, the first statement does not confirm that Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, only that there's a possibility he didn't. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer from these two statements that 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nAnswer: No."
