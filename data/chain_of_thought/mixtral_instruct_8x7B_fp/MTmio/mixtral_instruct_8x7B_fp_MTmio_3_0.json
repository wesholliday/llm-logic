This statement implies that the book could either be a mystery novel or it could be something else. We don't know yet.\n\n2. If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel. This statement means that if James wrote the book, then the book is definitely a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility of the book not being written by James. If the book was not written by James, based on the second statement, we cannot definitively say what kind of book it is. It could still potentially be a mystery novel, or it might not be. But since we have no evidence linking the book to James, we can't use the second statement to draw any conclusions.\n\nGiven that there's no information suggesting that the book is written by James, we cannot infer from these statements that 'The book was not written by James'.\n\nAnswer: No."
