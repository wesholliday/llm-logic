It doesn't rule out the possibility that the truck could be metal.\n\n2. 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal' is a conditional statement. If the condition (the doll being plastic) is true, then the consequence (the truck being metal) must also be true.\n\nHowever, the given statements do not provide enough information to conclude that the doll was not plastic. The first statement only casts doubt on the truck being metal, and the second statement only tells us what would be true if the doll were plastic. It doesn't tell us whether or not the doll is actually plastic.\n\nAnswer: No."
