            "content": "Explanation: Let's consider the two statements given:\n\n1. Sue might not have been at the wedding. This statement implies that Sue's presence at the wedding is uncertain or there's a possibility that she wasn't there.\n\n2. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This statement means that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue also had to be present.\n\nNow, let's think about the conclusion drawn from these statements: Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nTo determine if this conclusion is valid, we need to consider whether the second statement (the conditional statement) has been met. We don't know for sure whether Mary was at the wedding or not. If Mary was indeed at the wedding, then the second statement holds true and Sue also had to be there. However, since we're unsure about Mary's presence, we can't definitively say that she wasn't at the wedding. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Mary was not at the wedding' based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No."
