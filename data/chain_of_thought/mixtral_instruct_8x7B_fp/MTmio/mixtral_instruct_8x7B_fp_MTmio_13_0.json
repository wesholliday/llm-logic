The truck might not have been blue: This statement implies that there is a possibility that the truck was not blue, which means it could be any color other than blue.\n\n2. If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue: This is a conditional statement where if the condition (the car being red) is true, then the result (the truck being blue) must also be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility of the car being not red. If the car is not red, then the condition in the second statement is false. And when a conditional statement's condition is false, we cannot determine its result - it could be true or false. This is known as vacuous truth.\n\nHowever, since we cannot determine the truth value of the second statement when the car is not red, we cannot use this information to confirm or deny that 'The car was not red'.\n\nAnswer: No."
