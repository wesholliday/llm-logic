The banana might not have been yellow: This statement implies that there is a possibility that the banana was not yellow. It doesn't rule out the possibility that the banana could still be yellow.\n\n2. If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow: This is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the result (the banana being yellow) must also be true.\n\nThe question asks if we can infer 'The apple was not red'. To do this, we would need to find a contradiction with the apple being red.\n\nLooking at the second statement, if the apple was red, then the banana must be yellow. However, the first statement tells us that the banana might not have been yellow. This creates a contradiction, meaning that the apple cannot be red under these conditions.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
