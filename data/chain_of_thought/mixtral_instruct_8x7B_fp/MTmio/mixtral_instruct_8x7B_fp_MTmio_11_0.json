The muffins might not have been blueberry: This statement implies that there's a possibility that the muffins were not blueberry. It doesn't rule out the possibility that they could be blueberry, but it leaves room for uncertainty.\n\n2. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry: This is a conditional statement, often referred to as \"if-then\" statement. If the condition (the cake being chocolate) is true, then the consequence (the muffins being blueberry) must also be true.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot directly infer that the cake was not chocolate. The first statement does not provide any information about the cake, and the second statement only tells us that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would be blueberry. It doesn't tell us what the cake's flavor actually is.\n\nAnswer: No."
