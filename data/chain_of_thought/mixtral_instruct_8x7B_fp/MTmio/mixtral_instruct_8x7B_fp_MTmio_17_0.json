Kate might not have eaten salad (let's denote this as P: Kate did not eat salad).\n2. If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad (let's denote this as Q: Ben ate pasta \u2192 Kate ate salad).\n\nNow, let's consider the two possible cases for Kate not eating salad (P):\n\nCase 1: Ben ate pasta (Q is true). In this case, according to statement 2 (Q), Kate should have eaten salad, which contradicts statement 1 (P). Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\nCase 2: Ben did not eat pasta (~Q is true). In this case, there is no contradiction between statements 1 and 2, as Ben not eating pasta does not require Kate to eat salad.\n\nSince only Case 2 does not lead to a contradiction, we can conclude that Ben did not eat pasta based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
