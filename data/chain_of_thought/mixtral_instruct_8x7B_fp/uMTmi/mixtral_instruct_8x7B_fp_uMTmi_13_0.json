            "content": "Explanation: This is a tricky question because it involves conditional statements and the word \"might,\" which introduces uncertainty. \n\nFirst, let's consider the given statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" This is a classic example of a conditional statement, often denoted as \"if p then q.\" However, it does not necessarily mean that the car being red is the only condition for the truck to be blue.\n\nThe second statement is: \"The truck might not have been blue.\" This introduces doubt about the truck's color. It's possible that the truck was some other color.\n\nHowever, neither of these statements contradicts the possibility of the car being red. The fact that the truck's color might not be blue doesn't mean the car can't be red. It could be that the car is red and the truck is not blue, but is some other color.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: No."
