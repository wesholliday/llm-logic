This is a conditional statement known as a contrapositive.\n2. However, we also know that Sue might not have been at the wedding. This introduces a level of uncertainty.\n3. It's possible that Sue was at the wedding but not noticed, or that she left early, etc., which would mean she was there even though it might not seem like it.\n4. Without a clear statement that Sue was not at the wedding, we can't definitively say that Mary wasn't there either.\n\nAnswer: No."
