However, the statement does not tell us definitively whether the alien visited Mars or not. It's possible that the alien did visit Mars and the robot visited Jupiter, but it's also possible that the alien didn't visit Mars, which would mean we don't know whether the robot visited Jupiter or not. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: No."
