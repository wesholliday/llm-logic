The second statement contradicts the first one, meaning that the muffins could have been some other flavor besides blueberry. However, this does not necessarily mean that the cake cannot be chocolate. It's possible that the first condition was not met, and the cake was not chocolate. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the cake was not chocolate based on the given information.\nAnswer: No."
