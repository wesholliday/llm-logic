This implies that there is a possibility that the mummy was not awake, even though the condition for the vampire being awake is satisfied.\n\nHowever, the information provided does not give any details about the actual state of the vampire. It only tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would be awake, but it doesn't say that the vampire is indeed awake.\n\nSince we cannot determine the actual state of the vampire based on the given information, we cannot infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: No."
