However, it does not guarantee that if Chris finished the race, then Alex did as well.\n\nThe second statement \"Chris might not have finished the race\" introduces uncertainty about Chris's finish. If Chris didn't finish the race, then according to the first statement, Alex couldn't have finished either. But since we're told that Chris might not have finished, this doesn't necessarily mean Alex didn't either.\n\nHowever, crucially, there's no information given about Alex's finish that isn't dependent on Chris's finish. So we can't determine anything about Alex's result that we didn't already know about Chris's.\n\nAnswer: No."
