The first statement, \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel,\" is a type of conditional statement known as a logical implication. It tells us that if event A (the book being written by James) is true, then event B (the book being a mystery novel) must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement, \"Also, the book might not be a mystery novel,\" introduces some uncertainty about the type of book. This could mean that the book is not a mystery novel, but it could also simply mean that we do not know what type of book it is.\n\n3. However, this statement does not contradict the first statement. It's possible that James wrote a book that is not a mystery novel. The first statement only tells us that if James wrote the book, it would be a mystery novel. It doesn't tell us that James couldn't have written any other type of book.\n\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: No."
