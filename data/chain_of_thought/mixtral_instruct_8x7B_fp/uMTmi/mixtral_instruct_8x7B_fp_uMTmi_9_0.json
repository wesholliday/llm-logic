The first statement, \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt,\" is a conditional statement. It tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark had to buy the blue shirt. However, it doesn't say that Lisa actually bought the red shirt.\n\nThe second statement, \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt,\" introduces uncertainty about Mark's purchase. But this statement doesn't contradict the first statement because it's possible that Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, in which case Mark wouldn't need to buy the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: No."
