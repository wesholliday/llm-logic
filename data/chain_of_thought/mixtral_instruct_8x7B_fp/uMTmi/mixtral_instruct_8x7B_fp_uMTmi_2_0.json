            "content": "Explanation:  The given statement has two parts - a conditional statement and a possibility. The conditional statement is \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This does not guarantee that the griffin was in the forest, it only means that if it was, then the unicorn also had to be there. The second part of the statement is \"the unicorn might not have been in the forest.\" This introduces a doubt about the unicorn's presence in the forest, but it does not exclude the possibility that the griffin could still have been there.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the griffin was not in the forest. The information provided does not allow us to make such a conclusion."
