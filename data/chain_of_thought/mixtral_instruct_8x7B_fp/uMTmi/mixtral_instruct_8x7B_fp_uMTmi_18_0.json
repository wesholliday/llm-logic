            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" means that if the doll is made of plastic, it is guaranteed that the truck is made of metal. However, the statement \"the truck might not have been metal\" means that it is possible that the truck is not made of metal. These two statements together do not necessarily mean that the doll is not plastic, because the first statement only tells us that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal, but it doesn't say anything about what the doll could be if the truck is not metal. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic.\nAnswer: No."
