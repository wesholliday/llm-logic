However, the statement \"Bob might not have chosen pasta\" contradicts the conditional statement, making it uncertain whether Bob actually chose pasta or not.\n\nSince we cannot determine if Sue's choice of pizza is true or false, we cannot definitively conclude that she did not choose pizza. The information provided is inconsistent and does not allow us to make a firm deduction.\n\nAnswer: No."
