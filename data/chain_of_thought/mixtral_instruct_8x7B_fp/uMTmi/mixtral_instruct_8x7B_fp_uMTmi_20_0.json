            "content": "Explanation: No, we cannot infer that the apple was not red. The first statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" is a conditional statement which only tells us that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, it does not mean that the apple was actually red. The second statement \"the banana might not have been yellow\" does not contradict the first statement because it's possible for the banana to be yellow when the apple is red. Therefore, based on the given information, there is no evidence to suggest that the apple was not red. Answer: No."
