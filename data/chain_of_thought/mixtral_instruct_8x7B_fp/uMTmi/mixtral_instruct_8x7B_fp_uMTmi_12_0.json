            "content": "Explanation: We cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park. The first statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" is a conditional statement, implying that if Joe visited the park, Lucy visited the zoo. However, the second statement \"Lucy might not have gone to the zoo\" introduces uncertainty about Lucy's whereabouts. This statement does not necessarily mean that Lucy did not go to the zoo; it simply indicates that we do not know for sure whether she went or not. Since there is no definitive information about Lucy's visit to the zoo, we cannot make any conclusions about Joe's visit to the park.\n\nAnswer: No."
