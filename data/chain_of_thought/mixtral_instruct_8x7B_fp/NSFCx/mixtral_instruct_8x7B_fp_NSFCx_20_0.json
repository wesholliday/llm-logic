However, it does not exclude the possibility of both actions happening. The word \"or\" in this context can be interpreted as meaning \"one or the other, or possibly both.\" It's similar to how a menu might say \"tea or coffee\" - you can choose one, the other, or both. Therefore, based on the information given, it is reasonable to infer that 'The wozzle might gribble floob and the wozzle might gribble wumble' is a possibility.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
