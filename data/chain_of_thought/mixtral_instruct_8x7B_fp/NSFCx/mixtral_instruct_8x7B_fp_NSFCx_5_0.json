When we want to combine two possibilities, we use \"and\". However, simply because the snork might do one thing or another does not guarantee that it will do both. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The snork might gronk flonk and the snork might gronk flim\" is true based on the original statement.\nAnswer: No."
