It does not explicitly state that the quimble must be both, only that it could be either. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that \"The quimble might be quazzle and the quimble might be quibble\" because that would imply that the quimble is both, not just possibly one or the other.\n\nAnswer: No."
