This does not rule out the possibility that the quork could be both, but it also does not confirm it. However, the use of \"or\" generally implies that only one of the options is being considered at a time.\n\nTo get to \"The quork might be a plonk and the quork might be a blurble\", we would need a statement that clearly indicates the possibility of the quork being both a plonk and a blurble simultaneously. \n\nAnswer: No."
