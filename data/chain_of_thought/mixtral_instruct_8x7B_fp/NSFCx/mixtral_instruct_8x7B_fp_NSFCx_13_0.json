However, it does not explicitly state that both of these situations will occur. It could be the case that the wump blimps one but not the other, or that neither situation occurs. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The wump might blimp zump and the wump might blimp wibble\" is definitely true based on the given statement.\nAnswer: No."
