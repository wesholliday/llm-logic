            "content": "Explanation: This question is asking us to make an inference based on two statements. The first statement is \"The cake was chocolate\". The second statement is a conditional statement, meaning it describes what would happen under certain conditions. The condition here is \"If the cake was chocolate\". The consequence of this condition is \"then the muffins were blueberry\". \n\nTo determine if we can infer that the muffins were blueberry, we need to see if the condition in the second statement is true based on the information given in the first statement. In this case, the first statement tells us that the cake was chocolate. This matches the condition in the second statement, which says \"if the cake was chocolate\". Because the condition is true, we can then conclude the consequence, which is \"then the muffins were blueberry\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
