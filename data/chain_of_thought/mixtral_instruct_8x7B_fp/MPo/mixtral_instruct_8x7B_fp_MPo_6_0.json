            "content": "Explanation: In the given statement 'Sue chose pizza', we are not directly provided with information about Bob's choice. However, the second statement 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta' is a conditional statement which means that if the condition (Sue choosing pizza) is true, then the consequence (Bob choosing pasta) must also be true. Since the condition in this case is true, it follows that the consequence must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
