It means that if the condition (the car being red) is true, then the consequence (the truck being blue) must also be true. \n\nIn this case, since we are told that the car was red, this means that the condition of our conditional statement is true. Therefore, according to the logic of the conditional statement, the consequence (the truck being blue) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
