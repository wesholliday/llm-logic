            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' is a conditional statement, also known as a hypothesis or 'if' clause. It doesn't directly tell us that the truck is metal, it only states that if the doll has a certain property (being plastic), then the truck has another property (being metal).\n\nHowever, the first statement 'The doll was plastic' provides the necessary condition for the second statement to be true. Since the condition is true, it follows that the consequence must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on this logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that 'The truck was metal'.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
