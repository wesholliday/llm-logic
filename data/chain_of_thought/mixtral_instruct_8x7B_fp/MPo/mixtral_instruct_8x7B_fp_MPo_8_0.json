            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical inference and specifically the concept of validity in arguments.  In logic, an argument is valid if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. Here, the premises are 'The vampire was awake' and 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake'. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'The mummy was awake' from these two premises, we can use a form of argument called a hypothetical syllogism. The form is: \n\nP1: If A, then B\nP2: A\nC: Therefore, B\n\nIn this case, we can map 'The vampire was awake' to A and 'The mummy was awake' to B. So, the first premise 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' becomes 'If A, then B'. The second premise 'The vampire was awake' becomes 'A'. Therefore, the argument is in the form of a hypothetical syllogism and is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
