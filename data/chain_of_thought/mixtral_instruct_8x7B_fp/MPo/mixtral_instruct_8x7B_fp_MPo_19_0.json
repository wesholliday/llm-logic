If the second statement is true, then it means that there is a conditional relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball. The first statement tells us that Tom did indeed watch football. Therefore, since the second statement connects these two events, we can infer that Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
