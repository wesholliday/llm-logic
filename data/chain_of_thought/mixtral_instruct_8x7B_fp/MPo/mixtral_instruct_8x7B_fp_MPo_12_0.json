It means that the conclusion 'Lucy went to the zoo' is true only when the condition 'Joe went to the park' is true.\n\nSince the first statement is 'Joe went to the park', it satisfies the condition of the second statement. Therefore, we can infer that 'Lucy went to the zoo' is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
