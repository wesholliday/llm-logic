            "content": "Explanation: The second statement 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den' is a conditional statement, also known as an 'if-then' statement. It means that if the condition (the bear being in the cave) is true, then the consequence (the wolf being in the den) must also be true. In this case, the first statement tells us that the bear was indeed in the cave. Therefore, since the condition of the second statement is true, it follows that the consequence must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
