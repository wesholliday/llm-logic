            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis' is a conditional statement, also known as a hypothetical or \"if-then\" statement. It means that if the condition (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the consequence (Amy playing tennis) must also be true. In this case, the statement does not explicitly tell us that Jeff played basketball, but it implies that if he did, then Amy would have played tennis. Since we are given the information that 'Jeff played basketball', we can apply the condition from the conditional statement and infer that 'Amy played tennis'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
