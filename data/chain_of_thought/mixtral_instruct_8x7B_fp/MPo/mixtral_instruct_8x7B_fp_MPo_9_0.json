The part before the 'then' (in this case, 'If Lisa bought the red shirt') is called the antecedent, and the part after the 'then' (in this case, 'Mark bought the blue shirt') is called the consequent.\n\nIn this case, we are given that Lisa did indeed buy the red shirt (the antecedent is true). Given that the conditional statement is true, it follows that the consequent must also be true. Therefore, we can indeed infer that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
