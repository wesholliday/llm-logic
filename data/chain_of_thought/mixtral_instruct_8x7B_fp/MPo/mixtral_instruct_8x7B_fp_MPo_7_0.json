It means that the truth of the second part (consequent) 'Chris finished the race' is guaranteed only if the first part (antecedent) 'Alex finished the race' is true.\n\nIn this case, since we know that 'Alex finished the race' is true, it satisfies the condition of the given conditional statement. Therefore, we can infer that 'Chris finished the race' is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
