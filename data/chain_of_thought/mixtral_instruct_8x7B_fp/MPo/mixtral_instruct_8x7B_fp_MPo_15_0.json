            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' is a conditional statement, also known as a hypothetical or \"if-then\" statement. It means that the truth of the second part (Erin took a train) is dependent on the truth of the first part (Sam took a plane). \n\nIn this case, the statement 'Sam took a plane' gives us the necessary condition for the truth of 'Erin took a train'. Since we are told that Sam did indeed take a plane, it satisfies the necessary condition for Erin taking a train. Therefore, we can indeed infer that 'Erin took a train'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
