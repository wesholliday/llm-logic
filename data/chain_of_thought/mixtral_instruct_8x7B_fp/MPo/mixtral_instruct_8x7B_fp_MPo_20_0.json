The second statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. It states that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the consequence (the banana being yellow) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the condition of the second statement is the same as the information given in the first statement. Therefore, the condition is true. Since the condition is true, the consequence of the second statement must also be true.\n\nThe consequence of the second statement is 'the banana was yellow'. Therefore, based on the given information and the logical relationship between the statements, we can infer that 'the banana was yellow'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
