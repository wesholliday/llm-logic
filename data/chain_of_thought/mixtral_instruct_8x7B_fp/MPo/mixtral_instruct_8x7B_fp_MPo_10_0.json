            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' is a conditional statement, also known as an 'if-then' statement. It means that if the condition (the dog being inside) is true, then the consequence (the cat being outside) must also be true. In this case, the initial statement tells us that the dog was indeed inside. Given the conditional statement, this means that the consequence of the condition must also be true. Therefore, we can infer that the cat was outside.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
