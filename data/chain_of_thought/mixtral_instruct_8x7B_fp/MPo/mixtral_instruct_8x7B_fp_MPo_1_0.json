It means that the conclusion 'Sue was at the wedding' is true only if the condition 'Mary was at the wedding' is true.\n\nSince the first statement tells us that 'Mary was at the wedding', the condition of the second statement is satisfied. Therefore, we can validly infer the conclusion 'Sue was at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
