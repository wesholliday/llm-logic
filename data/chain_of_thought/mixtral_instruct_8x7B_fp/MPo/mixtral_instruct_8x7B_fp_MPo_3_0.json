Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (if P, then Q) and the antecedent of that statement (P), we can infer the consequent of that statement (Q). In this case, the conditional statement is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\". The antecedent of this statement is \"The book was written by James\". Therefore, we can infer the consequent of the statement, which is \"The book is a mystery novel\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
