            "content": "Explanation: This question is testing the logical concept of valid inference, where we determine if a conclusion necessarily follows from given premises. Here, the first premise is \"The griffin was in the forest.\" The second premise is a conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\nTo make a valid inference, we need to apply Modus Ponens, a rule of inference in classical logic. It states that if P \u2192 Q is true and P is true, then Q must be true. Here, P represents \"The griffin was in the forest\" and Q represents \"The unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\nIn this case, the first premise provides P, and the second premise, when viewed as an if-then statement, provides P \u2192 Q. Therefore, we can apply Modus Ponens and validly infer Q, which is \"The unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes"
