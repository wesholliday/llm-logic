However, when we break it down into two separate statements, \"The concert might feature rock music\" and \"the concert might feature jazz music\", we are considering both possibilities independently, which is a valid interpretation of the original statement. Therefore, yes, we can infer that \"The concert might feature rock music and the concert might feature jazz music\".\nAnswer: Yes."
