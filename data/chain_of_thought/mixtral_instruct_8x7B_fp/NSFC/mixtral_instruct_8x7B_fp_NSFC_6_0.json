It could arrive on Monday, but it's also possible that it arrives on Tuesday.\n\nWhen we break down the statement into \"The package might arrive on Monday\" and \"The package might arrive on Tuesday\", we are considering each day as a separate possibility. This means that we're not ruling out the possibility that the package might arrive on Tuesday even if it does end up arriving on Monday.\n\nSo yes, the two interpretations are equivalent in terms of the information they convey.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
