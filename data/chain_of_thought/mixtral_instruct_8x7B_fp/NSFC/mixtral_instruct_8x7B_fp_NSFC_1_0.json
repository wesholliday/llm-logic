However, it does not exclude the possibility that John might do both. The statement is not saying that John can only do one of the options, but rather that he will do at least one of them. Therefore, based on the given information, it is possible to infer that 'John might clean his room and John might go to the lecture'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
