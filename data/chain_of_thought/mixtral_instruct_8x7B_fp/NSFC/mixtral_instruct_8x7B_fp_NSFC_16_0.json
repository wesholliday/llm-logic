To infer whether we can say \"The student might pass the exam and the student might fail the exam,\" we need to examine if these two separate outcomes are being suggested.\n\nIn the original statement, the word \"or\" is used, which indicates that one of the two possibilities may occur. However, the target statement uses the conjunction \"and,\" which suggests that both possibilities are being considered at the same time.\n\nTo correctly infer the target statement from the original statement, we would need the original statement to use \"and\" instead of \"or.\" In this case, the original statement does not imply the target statement directly.\n\nAnswer: No."
