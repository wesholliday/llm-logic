However, it doesn't exclude the possibility of the movie being both. When it says \"or\", it could be interpreted as \"and/or\", which includes the possibility of both. Therefore, yes, from the original statement, we can infer that \"The movie might be a comedy and the movie might be a drama\".\n\nAnswer: Yes"
