Both of these outcomes are mentioned separately by the word 'or'. To combine these two outcomes into one statement without repeating the term 'the candidate might', we can join them with the conjunction 'and'. Therefore, the paraphrased statement would be 'The candidate might win the election and the candidate might lose the election'.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
