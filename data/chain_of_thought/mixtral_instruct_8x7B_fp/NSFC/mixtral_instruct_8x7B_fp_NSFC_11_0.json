When we consider the possibility of the train being early and the possibility of it being late as separate events, then yes, we can infer that \"The train might be early and the train might be late.\" This is because these two scenarios represent all the possible ways in which the train's arrival time could deviate from the expected time.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
