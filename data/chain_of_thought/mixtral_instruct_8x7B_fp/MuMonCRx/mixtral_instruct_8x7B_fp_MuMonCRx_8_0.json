The floob must be wumble quorple zibber\n\nThe 'and' in the statement indicates that both conditions must be true. However, the first condition does not negate or disqualify the second one. Even though the first condition is stated, it doesn't mean the second condition is false or cannot be true independently. Therefore, based on the information given, we can indeed infer 'The floob must be wumble quorple zibber'.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
