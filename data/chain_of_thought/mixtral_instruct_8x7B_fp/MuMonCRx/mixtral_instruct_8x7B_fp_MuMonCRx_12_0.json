This doesn't necessarily mean that only fribble and zibble zizz can interact with the glorp, but rather it's specifying the entities that are required to make the glorp quorple. It doesn't provide any information about other possible actions or states related to the glorp. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that 'The glorp must be zibble zizz'.\n\nAnswer: No."
