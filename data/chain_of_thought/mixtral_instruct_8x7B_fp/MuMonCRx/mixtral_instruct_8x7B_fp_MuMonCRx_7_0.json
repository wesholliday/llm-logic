It says that the frazzle must be quazzle, and it also says that the frazzle must be gribble quimble quorple. \n\nThe word \"and\" in this context is used to join two separate requirements. It does not mean that the first part of the requirement (being quazzle) is replaced by the second part (being gribble quimble quorple). \n\nTherefore, even though the second requirement includes the word \"gribble quimble quorple\", this does not mean that the frazzle cannot also be quazzle. It must meet both requirements.\n\nAnswer: No."
