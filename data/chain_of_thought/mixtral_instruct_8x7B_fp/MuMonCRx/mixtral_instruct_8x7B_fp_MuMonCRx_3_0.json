The original statement suggests that the quork is somehow related to or located in the wobble and zibble wumble, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the quork is the same as the zibble wumble. It's possible that the quork is a separate entity that interacts with the zibble wumble, or that the quork is a part of the zibble wumble. Without further context or information, we cannot definitively conclude that the quork must be the same as the zibble wumble.\n\nAnswer: No."
