However, it does not provide any information about what happens when the zonk is both twiddled and blorped. In logic, we cannot add conditions to a conditional statement unless they are explicitly stated or can be logically deduced from other information provided. Since the condition of it being blorped is not mentioned in the original statement and cannot be logically deduced, we cannot infer that the zonk will pluzzle under this additional condition.\n\nAnswer: No."
