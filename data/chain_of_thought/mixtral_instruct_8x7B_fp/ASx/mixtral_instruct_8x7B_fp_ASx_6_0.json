The statement does not specify any conditions under which the action would not cause harm to the speaker's snarfs.\n\nThe proposed statement \"If you glurp and I am wearing plorks, it will hurt my snarfs\" introduces a new condition, which is the speaker wearing plorks. Since the original statement does not provide any information about how additional conditions might affect the outcome, we cannot infer that the new condition would necessarily lead to the same consequence.\n\nAnswer: No."
