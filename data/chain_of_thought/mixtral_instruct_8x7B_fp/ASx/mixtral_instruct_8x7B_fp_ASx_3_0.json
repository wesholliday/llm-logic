In other words, we would need to know that the floopingness of the snarp is not relevant to the truth of the original statement.\n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide us with this information, so we cannot infer the second statement. It's possible that the floopingness of the snarp could prevent the fribble from being flugged, or it could be required for the fribble to be flugged. Without more information, we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No."
