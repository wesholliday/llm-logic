The second statement \"Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack\" is a disjunction, meaning one of the two parts must be true. \n\nIf the scarf doesn't have to be on the coat rack (first statement), then the only option left in the disjunction of the second statement is that \"it is stuffed in my backpack\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
