            "content": "Explanation: The first statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" means that it is possible for the keys to be somewhere other than dangling in the cabinet. The second statement \"Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer\" is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two parts must be true. \n\nTogether, these two statements tell us that the keys are not required to be dangling in the cabinet and that they could either be dangling in the cabinet or in the drawer. Since the first statement tells us that it's possible for the keys to be somewhere other than dangling in the cabinet, it follows that the keys must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
