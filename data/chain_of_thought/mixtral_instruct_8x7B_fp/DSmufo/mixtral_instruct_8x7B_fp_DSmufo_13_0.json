            "content": "Explanation: The first statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" means that it is not necessary for the toy to be on the bookshelf, which implies that the toy could be somewhere else. The second statement presents two possibilities: either the toy is on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box. Since we know from the first statement that the toy is not on the bookshelf, it must be in the only other place mentioned - the toy box.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
