It doesn't rule out the possibility that the notebook could be in the drawer. \n\nThe second statement \"Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer\" presents two possibilities: either the notebook is on the nightstand, or it is in the drawer. \n\nGiven that we know from the first statement that the notebook doesn't have to be on the nightstand, it must therefore be in the drawer. \n\nAnswer: Yes."
