The second statement \"Either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway\" presents two possibilities. Given that we know from the first statement that the newspaper does not have to be on the porch, this means that the only possibility left from the second statement is that \"the newspaper is in the driveway\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
