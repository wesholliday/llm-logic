            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden,\" is the negation of a modal claim, which implies that it is not necessary for Fido to be in the garden. This does not exclude the possibility that Fido could be in the garden, but it does mean that he is not required to be there.\n\nThe second statement, \"Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside,\" is a disjunction that presents two possibilities: either Fido must be in the garden, or he is inside. Since we know from the first statement that Fido is not required to be in the garden, the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer 'Fido is inside' based on the given statements."
