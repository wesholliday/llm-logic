            "content": "Explanation: The first statement \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet\" implies that it is possible for the jacket not to be in the closet. The second statement \"Either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair\" presents two possibilities: one, which we know is not necessarily true based on the first statement, and the other being that the jacket is draped over the chair. Since the first possibility has been ruled out, the only remaining possibility is that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
