The second statement, \"Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked,\" presents two possibilities: either the shank is nugged, or it is plooked. \n\nSince we know from the first statement that it's possible for the shank not to be nugged, the first possibility in the second statement (that the shank must be nugged) cannot be true. Therefore, the second possibility (that the shank is plooked) must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
