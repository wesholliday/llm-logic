This does not rule out the possibility of the grommet being plopped, but it just says that it's not a requirement.\n\nThe second statement \"Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed\" presents two possibilities: either the grommet must be plopped, or it is sploffed. \n\nGiven that we know from the first statement that it's not necessary for the grommet to be plopped, we can infer that the second part of the second statement must be true, because one of the two possibilities in the second statement must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that \"The grommet is sploffed\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
