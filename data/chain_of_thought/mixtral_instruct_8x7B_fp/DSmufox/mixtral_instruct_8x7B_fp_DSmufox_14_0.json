This does not necessarily mean that the clug cannot be snugged, just that it's not required.\n\nThe second statement \"Either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked\" presents two possibilities: either the clug must be snugged, or it is fleeked. Since we know from the first statement that it's not necessary for the clug to be snugged, we can infer that the second possibility must be true, and therefore the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
