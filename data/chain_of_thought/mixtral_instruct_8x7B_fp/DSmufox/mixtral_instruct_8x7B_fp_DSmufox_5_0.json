The second statement \"Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled\" presents two possibilities: that the zinger must be smoogled, or that it is fraggled. Since we know from the first statement that it's possible for the zinger to not be smoogled, the first possibility is ruled out. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that \"The zinger is fraggled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
