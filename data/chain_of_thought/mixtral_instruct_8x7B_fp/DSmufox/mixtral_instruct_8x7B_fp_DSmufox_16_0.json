The second statement is \"Either the sneg must be sproted or it is crampled\". This is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two statements must be true.\n\nGiven that the sneg cannot be necessarily sproted, it is possible that the sneg is in the state of being crampled. Therefore, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The sneg is crampled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
