Therefore, it is possible that the second statement is true because of the \"or\" clause, i.e., the smonk is vreebled.\n\nHowever, we cannot be certain that the smonk is vreebled because there is a possibility that the smonk is not plagged but in some other state that we are not aware of.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that \"The smonk is vreebled\".\n\nAnswer: No."
