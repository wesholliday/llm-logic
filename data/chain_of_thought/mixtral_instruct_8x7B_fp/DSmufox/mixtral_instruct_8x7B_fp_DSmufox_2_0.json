The second statement, \"Either the wug must be bimmed or it is flooped,\" presents two possibilities: either the wug must be bimmed, or it is flooped.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that it is not necessary for the wug to be bimmed, we can conclude that the first part of the second statement (the wug must be bimmed) is not true. Therefore, the second part of the statement must be true, which is \"it is flooped.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes."
