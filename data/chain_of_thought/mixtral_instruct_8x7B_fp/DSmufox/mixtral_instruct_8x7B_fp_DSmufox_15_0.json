It's not the case that the dreb must be spended (let's denote this as \u00acS).\n2. Either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed (let's denote this as S \u2228 V).\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer that the dreb is vroombed (V).\n\nTo do this, we'll use a proof technique called proof by contradiction. We'll assume that the dreb is not vroombed (\u00acV) and see if we can derive a contradiction with the given statements.\n\nIf the dreb is not vroombed (\u00acV), then, according to the second statement (S \u2228 V), the dreb must be spened (S). However, this contradicts the first statement (\u00acS), which states that the dreb does not have to be spened.\n\nSince our assumption (\u00acV) leads to a contradiction, we can conclude that our assumption is false, and therefore, the dreb must be vroombed (V).\n\nAnswer: Yes."
