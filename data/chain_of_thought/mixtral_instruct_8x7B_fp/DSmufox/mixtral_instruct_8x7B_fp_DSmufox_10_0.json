            "content": "Explanation: The first statement \"It's not the case that the wug must be garbled\" means that it is possible for the wug to not be garbled. The second statement \"Either the wug must be garbled or it is sproinged\" presents two possibilities: either the wug is garbled or it is sproinged. Since we know from the first statement that the wug does not have to be garbled, it's possible that the wug is not garbled and therefore must be sproinged. Therefore, based on this reasoning, we can infer that 'The wug is sproinged'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
