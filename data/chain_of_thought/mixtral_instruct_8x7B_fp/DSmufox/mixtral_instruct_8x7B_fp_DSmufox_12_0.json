The second statement \"Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped\" presents two possibilities: either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped.\n\nGiven that the first statement negates the second part of the second statement (i.e., \"the smip must be lupped\"), we are left with the first part of the second statement: \"it is shripped\".\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The smip is shripped\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
