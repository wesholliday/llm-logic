This means that it's possible for the flob to not be movated.\n\nThe second statement \"Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled\" is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two component statements must be true.\n\nIf the first statement is true (which we know it is, because we're given it as a premise), then the second statement implies that the flob is skizzled.\n\nThis is because if the flob doesn't have to be movated, then it must be skizzled in order for the second statement to be true.\n\nAnswer:  Yes."
