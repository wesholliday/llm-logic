To infer \"The splat is morphed\", we need to determine if the first statement negates the possibility of the splat being quanked and the second statement affirms one of the two possibilities for the splat's state.\n\nGiven that the first statement negates the necessity of the splat being quanked, it means that the splat can still be in another state. The second statement then provides the two possible states for the splat, one of which is that the splat is morphed. Since the first statement does not exclude the possibility of the splat being morphed, and the second statement includes this possibility, we can indeed infer that \"The splat is morphed\".\n\nAnswer: Yes"
