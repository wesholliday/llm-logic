The second statement \"Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered\" presents two possibilities: either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered. Since we know from the first statement that the fleeg does not have to be surned, it must be the case that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
