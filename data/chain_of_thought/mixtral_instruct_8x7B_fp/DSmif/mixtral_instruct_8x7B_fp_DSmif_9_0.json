            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of disjunctive syllogism, a form of logical reasoning that takes the form \"Either P or Q, not P, therefore Q\". Here, the puzzle piece being in the box (Q) is one of the two possibilities (P or Q), and the puzzle piece not blending in on the floor (not P) is the negation of the other possibility. Since neither possibility is true, it must be the case that the puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
