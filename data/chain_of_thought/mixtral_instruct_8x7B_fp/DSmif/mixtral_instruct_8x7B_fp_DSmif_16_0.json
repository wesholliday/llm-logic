If the pen is not on my desk, as stated in 'The pen might not be on my desk', then it could be in my bag. However, this inference only tells us that the pen could be in my bag, not that it definitely is. Other possibilities, such as the pen being lost or thrown away, cannot be ruled out based on the given information. Therefore, while it's possible that the pen is in my bag, we cannot definitively infer that it is.\n\nAnswer: No."
