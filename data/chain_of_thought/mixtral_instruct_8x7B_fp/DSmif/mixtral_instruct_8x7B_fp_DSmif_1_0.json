It could mean that Fido is not in the garden, but it could also mean that we're not sure if Fido is in the garden or not.\n\nHowever, the first statement does not say that Fido cannot be anywhere else, it only states that if Fido is not in the garden, then Fido must be inside. It does not exclude the possibility that Fido could be inside even if he is in the garden.\n\nTherefore, from these two statements, we cannot infer that 'Fido is inside'. Answer: No."
