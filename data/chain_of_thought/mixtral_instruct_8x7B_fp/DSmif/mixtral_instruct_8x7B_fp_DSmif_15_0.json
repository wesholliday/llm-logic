This is because there could be other possibilities not mentioned in the original statement, such as the shoes being scattered around the house, or even being outside.\n\nHowever, given the limited options presented in the original statement, and assuming no other possibilities exist in this context, then yes, we could infer that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: Yes, assuming no other possibilities exist beyond what was stated."
