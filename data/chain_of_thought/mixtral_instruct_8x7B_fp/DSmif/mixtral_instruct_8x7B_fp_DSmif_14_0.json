However, it does not preclude the possibility that the milk could be somewhere else or that it could be both in the fridge and on the counter.\n\nThe statement 'The milk might not be chilling in the fridge' means that there is a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. It does not explicitly state that the milk is on the counter.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that 'The milk is on the counter'. It could be on the counter, but it could also be in some other location outside of the fridge.\n\nAnswer: No."
