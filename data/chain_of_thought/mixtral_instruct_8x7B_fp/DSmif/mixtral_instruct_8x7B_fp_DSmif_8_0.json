            "content": "Explanation: This is a logical reasoning question that involves disjunctive syllogism, a form of argument in classical logic. The statement \"Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table\" is a disjunction, a logical connective that joins two or more statements with the logical meaning of \"one or the other or both.\" In this case, the disjunction is between the remote control being under the couch and the remote control being on the coffee table.\n\nThe second statement given is \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\" This is the negation of the first part of the disjunction in the first statement.\n\nTogether, these two statements allow us to infer that the remote control must be on the coffee table, because the only other option given has been ruled out.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
