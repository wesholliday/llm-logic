            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of logical reasoning using transitive inference. The statement 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den' is a conditional statement, often denoted as \"if p then q\". The second statement is \"The wolf was not in the den\", or \"not q\". \n\nTo infer whether \"The bear was not in the cave\" (or \"not p\"), we need to consider the truth values of p and q. If q is false, then the conditional statement \"if p then q\" can only be true if p is also false. This is because in logic, a conditional statement is only false when the antecedent (p) is true and the consequent (q) is false. \n\nTherefore, given the two statements, if the wolf was not in the den, then the bear cannot be in the cave.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
