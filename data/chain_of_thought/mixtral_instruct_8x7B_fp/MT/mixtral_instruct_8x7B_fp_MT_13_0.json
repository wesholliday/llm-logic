            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical reasoning problem that can be solved using rules of inference. The statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' is a conditional statement, often denoted as \"If P, then Q\". The second statement is 'The truck was not blue', denoted as \"not Q\". The question asks if we can infer 'The car was not red', denoted as \"not P\".\n\nTo answer this, we apply logical reasoning. If the condition (P) is true and the result (Q) is false, this is a contradiction to the original conditional statement. Therefore, the condition must be false. So, 'The car was not red' is the inferred conclusion.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
