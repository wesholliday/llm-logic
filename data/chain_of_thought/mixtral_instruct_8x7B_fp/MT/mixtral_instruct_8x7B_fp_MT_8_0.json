            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of logical reasoning using contrapositive statements. The original statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" can be translated into logical terms as \"Vampire awake (V) -> Mummy awake (M)\". \n\nThe negation of the given statement \"The mummy was not awake\" is \"Not mummy awake\" or \"Mummy not awake\" in symbolic form.\n\nWe want to find out if \"Not vampire awake\" or \"Vampire not awake\" follows from this.\n\nTo do this, we use the contrapositive of the original statement which is \"Not mummy awake (M') -> Not vampire awake (V')\". This means that if the mummy is not awake, then the vampire cannot be awake either.\n\nSince it is given that \"Mummy not awake\", using the contrapositive, we can infer that \"Vampire not awake\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
