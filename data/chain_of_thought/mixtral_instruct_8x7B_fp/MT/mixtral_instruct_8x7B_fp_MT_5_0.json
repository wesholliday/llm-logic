            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical reasoning question that can be solved using rules of inference, specifically transitive inference and modus tollens. \n\nFirst, we have the conditional statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'. This can be written in logical notation as: Jeff played basketball -> Amy played tennis.\n\nNext, we are given that Amy did not play tennis. In logical notation, this is: ~(Amy played tennis).\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball. In logical notation, this is: ~(Jeff played basketball).\n\nTo make this inference, we can use transitive inference and modus tollens. Transitive inference allows us to infer that if A implies B and B implies C, then A implies C. In this case, we can infer that if Jeff playing basketball implies Amy playing tennis (A -> B), and Amy not playing tennis implies something about Jeff not playing basketball (~B -> ~A), then we can combine these to infer that Jeff playing basketball implies Jeff not playing basketball (A -> ~A), which is a contradiction. Therefore, we must conclude that Jeff did not play basketball (~A).\n\nModus tollens is a rule of inference that states that if a conditional statement P -> Q is true, and the negation of Q is true, then the negation of P is true. In this case, we can apply modus tollens to the conditional statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis' (Jeff played basketball -> Amy played tennis) and the fact that Amy did not play tennis (~(Amy played tennis)) to infer that Jeff did not play basketball (~(Jeff played basketball)).\n\nAnswer: Yes."
