            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical reasoning question using contrapositive statements. The original statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" can be restated as \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\". This is because the contrapositive of a statement is always true if the original statement is true. Given that the truck was not metal, using the contrapositive statement, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
