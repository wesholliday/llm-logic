            "content": "Explanation: This question is a test of logical reasoning, specifically the concept of transitive inference in logic. The statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' is an example of a conditional statement, where the red apple is the antecedent and the yellow banana is the consequent. The second statement 'The banana was not yellow' contradicts the consequent of the first statement. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'The apple was not red', we need to evaluate if the truth of the second statement negates the conditionality of the first statement. In this case, the second statement 'The banana was not yellow' does not directly address the conditionality of the first statement. It only contradicts the consequent of the first statement. \n\nHowever, the first statement is a conditional statement, which means that the truth of the consequent (the banana being yellow) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (the apple being red). It only means that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true. \n\nTherefore, even though the second statement contradicts the consequent of the first statement, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent is false. It is possible that the apple could still be red, even if the banana is not yellow. \n\nAnswer: No."
