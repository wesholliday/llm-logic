            "content": "Explanation: This is a logical reasoning question that uses conditional statements. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first statement says 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta'. This is a conditional statement where the condition (Sue choosing pizza) leads to a result (Bob choosing pasta).\n2. The second statement says 'Bob did not choose pasta'.\n\nNow, we want to find out if we can conclude 'Sue did not choose pizza'. To do this, we assume the opposite of what we want to prove and see if it leads to a contradiction.\n\n3. Let's assume 'Sue chose pizza'. According to the first statement, if Sue chose pizza, then Bob should have chosen pasta. But the second statement tells us that 'Bob did not choose pasta'. We have a contradiction.\n4. Since our assumption led to a contradiction, the opposite must be true. Therefore, 'Sue did not choose pizza'.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
