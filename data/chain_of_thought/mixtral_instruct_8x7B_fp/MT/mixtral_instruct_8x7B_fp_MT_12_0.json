The original statement can be written in logical form as:\n\nIf P, then Q\n\nwhere P represents \"Joe went to the park\" and Q represents \"Lucy went to the zoo\".\n\nThe second statement gives us the information that not-Q is true, i.e., Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nNow, if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must be false. This is because if P were true, then Q would have to be true as well, but we know that Q is false. Therefore, P cannot be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
