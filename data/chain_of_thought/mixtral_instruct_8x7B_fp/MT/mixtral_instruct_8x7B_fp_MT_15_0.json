If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. (Implied: If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane)\n2. Erin did not take a train.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios for the second statement:\n- Erin took a train: This option is not possible because we are told that Erin did not take a train.\n- Erin did not take a train: This is the given scenario.\n\nAccording to the first statement, if Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane. Since Erin did not take a train, it follows that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
