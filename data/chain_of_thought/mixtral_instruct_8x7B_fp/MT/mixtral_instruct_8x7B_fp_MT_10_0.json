            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument in the form of a conditional statement. The original statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" is in the form of a hypothetical conditional, often denoted as \"If P, then Q\". The second statement \"The cat was not outside\" is a denial of the consequence, or \"not Q\". \n\nThe logical principle at play here is called contrapositive reasoning. The contrapositive of a hypothetical conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". This principle states that a hypothetical conditional and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning they have the same truth value.\n\nIn this case, the original statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" has the contrapositive \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside\". Given that the second statement is \"The cat was not outside\", it follows that \"The dog was not inside\" by contrapositive reasoning.\n\nHowever, this is not the conclusion we are asked to draw. We are asked to infer \"The dog was inside\". To make this inference, we need to negate the contrapositive statement \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside\" to get \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was inside\". This is a valid inference based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
