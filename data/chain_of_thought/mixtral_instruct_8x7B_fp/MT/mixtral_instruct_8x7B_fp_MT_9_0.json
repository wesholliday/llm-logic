            "content": "Explanation: This is a logical reasoning question that follows the structure of a conditional statement, or \"if-then\" statement. The first sentence, \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt,\" is the conditional statement. The second sentence, \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt,\" is a statement of fact.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt,\" we need to consider the truth values of the statements. If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then the conditional statement cannot be true, because the condition for the statement to be true is that Lisa bought the red shirt. Therefore, if the condition is not met, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
