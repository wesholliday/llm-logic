This means that Mary's presence at the wedding guarantees Sue's presence, but it doesn't work the other way around - Sue could have been at the wedding for some other reason, or the statement could be false.\n\nHowever, we are also told that Sue was not at the wedding. Because the conditional statement only guarantees Sue's presence if Mary is there, and Sue was not there, this does not give us any information about Mary's presence or absence. It's possible that Mary was at the wedding and Sue was absent despite the guarantee, or it's possible that neither of them were there.\n\nAnswer: No."
