This means that the two events are connected - Chris's finishing depends on Alex's finishing. If the condition (Alex finishing) is not met, then the consequence (Chris finishing) does not have to be true.\n\nIn this case, we are given that Chris did not finish the race. Given the conditional statement, this means that Alex must not have finished the race either, because if Alex had finished, then Chris would have had to as well. Since Chris didn't, Alex couldn't have.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
