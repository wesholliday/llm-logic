            "content": "Explanation: This is a logical reasoning question that follows the structure of a conditional statement, or \"if-then\" statement. The first sentence, \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad,\" is the conditional statement. The second sentence, \"Kate did not eat the salad,\" is the negation of the conclusion of the conditional statement. \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"Ben did not eat pasta,\" we need to consider the truth values of the premises and the conclusion. If the conditional statement is true and its conclusion is false, then the premise must be false. In this case, the conclusion of the conditional statement is \"Kate ate the salad,\" which is false. Therefore, the premise \"Ben ate pasta\" must be false, which means the conclusion \"Ben did not eat pasta\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
