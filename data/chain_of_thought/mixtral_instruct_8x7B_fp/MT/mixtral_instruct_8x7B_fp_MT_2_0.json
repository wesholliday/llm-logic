            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of logical reasoning using transitive properties. The statement 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest' is a conditional statement, often denoted as P -> Q. Here, P represents 'The griffin was in the forest' and Q represents 'The unicorn was in the forest'.\n\nThe second statement given is 'The unicorn was not in the forest', denoted as ~Q.\n\nWhat we want to find out is whether 'The griffin was not in the forest', denoted as ~P.\n\nAccording to the laws of logic, if P -> Q is true and ~Q is true, then ~P must also be true. This is known as Modus Tollens.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can indeed infer 'The griffin was not in the forest'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
