            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical reasoning problem that can be solved using rules of inference, specifically contrapositive. The original statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" can be restated as \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball\" by using the contrapositive rule. Given that Jen did not watch basketball, it follows that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
