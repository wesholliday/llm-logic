            "content": "Explanation: This is a contrapositive reasoning problem. The original statement is in the form \"If A, then B\". We are given that \"not B\" is true, and we want to determine if \"not A\" must be true. If the contrapositive of the original statement is also true - that is, \"If not B, then not A\" - then we can indeed make the inference that \"The shirt was not cotton\". \n\nIn this case, the contrapositive \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\" is logically equivalent to the original statement. Since we know that the pants were not denim, it follows that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
