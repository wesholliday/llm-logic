The original statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" can be restated in the form \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement and is logically equivalent to it. Given that the muffins were not blueberry, it follows that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
