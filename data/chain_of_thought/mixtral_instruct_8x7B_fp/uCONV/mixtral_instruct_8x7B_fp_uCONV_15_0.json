            "content": "Explanation: This question is about logical reasoning and specifically concerns a concept known as contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement (if p then q) is the statement \"if not q then not p.\" If the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nIn this case, the original statement is \"if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" The contrapositive of this statement would be \"if Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\nHowever, the information provided does not directly tell us whether Erin did not take a train, so we cannot definitively say whether Sam did not take a plane. We can only infer the contrapositive statement if we know for certain that Erin did not take a train.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that if Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane. We can only infer the contrapositive statement under certain conditions, which are not provided in the question."
