It tells us that there is a relationship between Ben's eating pasta and Kate's eating salad, but it doesn't directly tell us about the reverse situation.\n\nHowever, the statement only guarantees that Ben eating pasta implies Kate eating salad, not the other way around. It's possible that Kate could eat salad without Ben eating pasta, but the statement doesn't allow us to conclude that Ben eating pasta is a guaranteed result of Kate eating salad.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta.\n\nAnswer: No."
