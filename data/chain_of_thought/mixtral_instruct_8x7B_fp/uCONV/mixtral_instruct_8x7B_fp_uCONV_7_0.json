The '->' symbol means 'implies'. \n\nThe statement is in the form of P -> Q, where P is \"Alex finished the race\" and Q is \"Chris finished the race\". \n\nWe are asked to determine if the converse of this statement is true. The converse would be \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race\", or Q -> P. \n\nIn general, the truth of a statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse. However, in this case, we are not given any information about the race other than the conditional statement. Therefore, we cannot determine if the converse is true or not based on the information provided. \n\nAnswer: No."
