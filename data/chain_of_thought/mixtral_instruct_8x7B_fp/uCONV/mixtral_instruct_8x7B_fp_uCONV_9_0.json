The hypothesis is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and the conclusion is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\". \n\nThis does not necessarily mean that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt. This is because there could be other possibilities for why Mark bought the blue shirt - maybe Lisa told him she didn't like the red one after he had already bought his shirt. \n\nAnswer: No."
