It tells us that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the consequence (the banana being yellow) follows.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that the reverse is also true. Just because the banana being yellow follows the apple being red, it doesn't mean that the apple being red precedes the banana being yellow. The color of the apple and banana could be independent of each other.\n\nAnswer: No."
