It tells us that if the condition (the vampire being awake) is true, then the consequence (the mummy being awake) must also be true. \n\nHowever, this statement does not tell us anything about the reverse scenario - whether the mummy being awake implies that the vampire is awake. For that, we would need a statement in the form \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake\". \n\nWithout this statement, we cannot infer that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: No."
