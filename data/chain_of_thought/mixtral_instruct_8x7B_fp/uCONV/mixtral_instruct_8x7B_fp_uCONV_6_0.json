The conclusion is \"Bob chose pasta\". \n\nWhen we want to determine if the converse of a conditional statement is true, we reverse the condition and the conclusion. So, the converse would be \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza\".\n\nHowever, just because the original statement is true, it does not automatically mean that the converse is also true. We need more information to confirm this. \n\nIf Bob's choice of pasta was not dependent on Sue's choice of pizza, but was his own independent choice, then the converse would not necessarily be true.\n\nAnswer: No."
