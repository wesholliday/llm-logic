The part before the comma (\"if the car was red\") is the hypothesis, and the part after the comma (\"then the truck was blue\") is the conclusion.\n\nIn this case, the statement only tells us that if the car is red, then the truck is blue. It doesn't tell us anything about the situation when the truck is blue. It could be possible that there are other reasons for the truck to be blue, not necessarily because the car is red.\n\nTherefore, even though the two statements \"if the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and \"if the truck was blue, then the car was red\" have the same hypotheses and conclusions but in reverse order, they do not necessarily mean the same thing.\n\nAnswer: No."
