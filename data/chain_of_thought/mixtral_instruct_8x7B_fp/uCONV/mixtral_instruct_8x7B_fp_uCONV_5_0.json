However, it only specifies the implication in one direction: it says that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. It does not explicitly state that the reverse is also true.\n\nJust because the forward implication is true (i.e., if A then B), we cannot automatically assume the reverse implication is also true (i.e., if B then A). This is a common fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\"\n\nAnswer: No."
