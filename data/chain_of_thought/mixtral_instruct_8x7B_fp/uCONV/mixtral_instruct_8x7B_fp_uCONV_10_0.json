However, it does not cover all possibilities - it doesn't tell us what happens if the cat is outside. \n\nTo infer that if the cat is outside, then the dog is inside, we would need a statement that covers this possibility. Without such a statement, we cannot definitively say whether this is true or not.\n\nAnswer: No."
