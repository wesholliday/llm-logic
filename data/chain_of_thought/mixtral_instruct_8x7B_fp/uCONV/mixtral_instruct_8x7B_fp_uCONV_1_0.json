It states that if A is true (Mary was at the wedding), then B is true (Sue was at the wedding). \n\nHowever, the statement does not provide information about the reverse scenario. That is, it doesn't tell us if the presence of Sue at the wedding guarantees the presence of Mary. \n\nFor the inference to be true, we would need a statement in the form \"if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\". But since no such statement is provided, we cannot infer this from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
