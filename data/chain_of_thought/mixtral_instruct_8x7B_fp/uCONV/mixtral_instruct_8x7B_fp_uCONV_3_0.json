            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that the book was written by James given that it's a mystery novel, we need to consider the direction of logical implication. The original statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is a conditional statement where the hypothesis is \"the book was written by James\" and the conclusion is \"the book is a mystery novel.\" This does not allow us to directly infer the reverse, i.e., if the book is a mystery novel, then it was written by James. There could be other authors who write mystery novels as well. Hence, we cannot make this inference based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No."
