From this information, we cannot directly determine the flavor of the muffins. The given statements only establish a connection between the cake being chocolate and the muffins being blueberry, but they do not provide any explicit information about what happens when the cake is not chocolate. Therefore, it is possible that the muffins could still be blueberry or could be some other flavor.\n\nAnswer: No."
