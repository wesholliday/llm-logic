The dog was not inside.\n\nFrom the first statement, we cannot directly conclude that if the dog is not inside, then the cat must be outside, because the first statement only provides a conditional statement about the cat's location based on the dog's location.\n\nSince the dog was not inside, the first statement does not apply here, so we cannot use it to determine the cat's location. Therefore, we cannot infer that the cat was not outside.\n\nAnswer: No."
