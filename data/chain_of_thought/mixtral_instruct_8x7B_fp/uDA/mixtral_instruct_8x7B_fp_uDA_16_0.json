From this, we cannot infer that the pants were not denim. This is because the first statement only tells us what would be true if the shirt was cotton, but it doesn't require the pants to be denim when the shirt is not cotton. Therefore, even though the shirt is not cotton, the pants could still be denim.\n\nAnswer: No."
