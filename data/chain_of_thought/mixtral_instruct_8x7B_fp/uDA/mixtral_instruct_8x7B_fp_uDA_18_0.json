However, the second statement tells us that the doll was not plastic. It doesn't specify what material the doll is made of, so it could still potentially be metal or any other material. Since we don't have enough information about the truck's material when the doll is not plastic, we cannot make a definitive statement about the truck being metal or not.\n\nAnswer: No."
