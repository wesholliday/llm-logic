The two statements together imply that Sue chose something other than pizza, but it doesn't necessarily mean she chose pizza and then changed her mind. It could be that she never intended to choose pizza in the first place. But even if she did initially choose pizza and then changed her mind, we are not told what she changed it to. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively say what Bob chose.\n\nAnswer: No."
