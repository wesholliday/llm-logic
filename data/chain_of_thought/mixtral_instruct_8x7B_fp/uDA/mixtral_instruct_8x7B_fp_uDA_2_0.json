This is because the first statement is a conditional statement, meaning that the presence of the griffin in the forest is a sufficient condition for the unicorn to be in the forest, but not a necessary condition. Therefore, even if the griffin is not in the forest, the unicorn could still be there.\n\nAnswer: No."
