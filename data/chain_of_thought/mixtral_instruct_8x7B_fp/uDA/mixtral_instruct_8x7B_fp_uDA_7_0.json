However, in this case, we have an additional piece of information that Alex did not finish the race. The initial statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is a conditional statement, also known as a hypothesis or a proposition, which means it only applies when the condition (Alex finishing the race) is met. Since we know that Alex did not finish the race, the condition is not met, and the truth of the conditional statement does not apply. Therefore, we cannot infer that Chris did not finish the race based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No."
