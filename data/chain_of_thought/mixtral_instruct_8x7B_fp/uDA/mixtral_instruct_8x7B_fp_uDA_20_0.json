            "content": "Explanation: To answer this question, we need to understand the conditional statements given. The first statement says \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\". This is a Type of conditional statement called \"conditional if\" where the condition (apple being red) leads to a result (banana being yellow). However, it does not mean that the absence of the condition (apple not being red) would mean the absence of the result (banana not being yellow). The second statement tells us that \"the apple was not red\". But this does not give us enough information to determine the color of the banana. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the banana was not yellow.\n\nAnswer: No."
