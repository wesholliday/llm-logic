However, the second statement tells us that the bear was not in the cave. From this, we cannot definitively conclude that the wolf was not in the den because the second statement does not provide any information about the wolf's location. It's possible that the wolf could still be in the den even if the bear is not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: No."
