However, there's a contradiction in the given statements: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" and \"the book was not written by James\". Since the book was not written by James, we cannot use the first statement to make any inferences about the type of book it is. Therefore, we cannot infer that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: No."
