Based on this information, the conditional statement \"if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" does not apply because its condition is false. Therefore, the truth of Kate eating salad is not determined by the given information. We cannot infer that she did not eat salad either, as there is no specific information about what Kate ate.\n\nAnswer: No."
