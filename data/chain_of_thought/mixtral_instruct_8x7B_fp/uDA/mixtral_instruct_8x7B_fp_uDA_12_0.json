            "content": "Explanation: No, we cannot infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo. The first statement is a conditional statement, meaning that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. However, this does not mean that Lucy only goes to the zoo when Joe goes to the park. The second statement tells us that Joe did not go to the park, but it does not necessarily mean that Lucy did not go to the zoo. It's possible that Lucy still went to the zoo even if Joe didn't go to the park.\n\nAnswer: No."
