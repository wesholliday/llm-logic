However, they do not tell us what happens if Jeff does not play basketball. In this case, it is specified that Jeff did not play basketball, but it does not give any information about Amy's tennis playing habits. It is possible that Amy still played tennis, or it is possible that she did not. Without more information, we cannot definitively say one way or the other.\n\nAnswer: No."
