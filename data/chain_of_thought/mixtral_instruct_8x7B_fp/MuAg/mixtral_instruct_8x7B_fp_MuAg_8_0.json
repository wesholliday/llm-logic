            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays and it must have served Italian cuisine\" contains two independent clauses joined by the conjunction \"and\". The first clause is \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays\", and the second clause is \"it must have served Italian cuisine\". These two clauses are independent of each other, meaning that the truth of one clause does not depend on the truth of the other clause.\n\nWhen we combine these two clauses with \"and\", we are saying that both clauses are true. Therefore, the statement \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays and served Italian cuisine\" is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
