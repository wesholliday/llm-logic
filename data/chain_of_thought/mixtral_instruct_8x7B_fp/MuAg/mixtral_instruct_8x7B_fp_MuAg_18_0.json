            "content": "Explanation: The sentence \"The medicine must have been taken with food and it must have been taken twice daily\" contains two independent clauses: \"The medicine must have been taken with food\" and \"it must have been taken twice daily.\" The second clause uses \"it\" as a pronoun, which refers back to \"the medicine.\" In the sentence \"The medicine must have been taken with food and been taken twice daily,\" the two actions are combined into a single clause using the conjunction \"and\" to link them. The second part of the clause uses \"been taken\" instead of \"it must have been taken\" because it is in a passive voice and the subject \"it\" is already mentioned in the first part of the clause. Therefore, both sentences convey the same meaning, which is the medicine must be taken with food and it must be taken twice a day.\nAnswer: Yes."
