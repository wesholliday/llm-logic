            "content": "Explanation: The given original statement is \"The exam must have been difficult and it must have covered all chapters\". The proposed statement is \"The exam must have been difficult and covered all chapters\". The two statements convey the same meaning, as they both say that the exam was difficult and that it covered all chapters. The word \"it\" in the original statement refers to the exam, and in the proposed statement, the phrase \"and it\" is replaced with \"and\" without changing the meaning. Therefore, the proposed statement can be inferred from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
