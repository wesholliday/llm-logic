The first clause is \"The software must have been updated\", and the second clause is \"it must have been restarted\". The suggested statement also has these two clauses connected by the conjunction \"and\", indicating that both events occurred. Since the individual clauses are the same in both statements, and the original statement confirms that both clauses are true, it is reasonable to infer that the suggested statement is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
