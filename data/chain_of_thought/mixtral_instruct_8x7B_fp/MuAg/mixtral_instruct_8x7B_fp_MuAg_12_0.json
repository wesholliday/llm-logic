            "content": "Explanation: The two statements \"the project must have been completed by Friday and it must have been under budget\" and \"the project must have been completed by Friday and been under budget\" are equivalent in meaning. In both cases, the project is required to be finished by Friday and also required to be under budget. The only difference is that in the first statement, \"it must have been under budget\" is separated by a comma, while in the second statement, \"been under budget\" is directly connected to the first requirement with no comma. This difference in punctuation does not change the meaning of the sentence, so the two statements can be considered equivalent.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
