This is because the conjunction \"and\" connects two separate clauses, each with its own subject and verb. The word \"must\" indicates necessity or certainty, and it applies independently to each clause. Therefore, the order of the clauses can be changed without affecting the meaning of the statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
