The password must have been eight characters long and included a number.\n\nThese two statements convey the same meaning. The use of the word 'it' in the first statement refers to the password, which is already mentioned at the beginning of the sentence. Therefore, the word 'it' is unnecessary and redundant. Including 'and it' does not change the meaning of the sentence, it only adds extra, unnecessary words.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
