            "content": "Explanation: The original statement has two conditions joined by the conjunction 'and'. The first condition is that the application must have been completed online, and the second condition is that it must have included references. These two conditions are independent of each other; completing the application online does not affect whether or not references are included, and including references does not affect whether or not the application is completed online. Therefore, the order in which these conditions are written does not change the meaning of the statement. So, yes, we can infer that 'The application must have been completed online and included references'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
