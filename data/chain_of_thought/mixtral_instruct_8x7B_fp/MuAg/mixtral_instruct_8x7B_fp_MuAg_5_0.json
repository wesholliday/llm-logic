The second condition (it must have been signed for) is dependent on the first condition (it must have been delivered) being true. When we remove the repetition of \"it must have been\" from the original statement, the meaning does not change because the two conditions are still implied. Therefore, yes, we can infer that \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
