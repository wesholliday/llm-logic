            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The contract must have been valid for a year and it must have been renewable\" contains two conditions: first, that the contract was valid for a year, and second, that it was renewable. When combining these two conditions into a single phrase, as in \"The contract must have been valid for a year and been renewable,\" the meaning remains unchanged. This is because the word \"and\" indicates that both conditions must be met, which is consistent with the original statement. Therefore, the two statements are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
