Each clause contains a modal verb 'must have' followed by a past participle form of the verb 'delayed' and 'rerouted'. \n\nThe first clause \"The flight must have been delayed\" indicates a certainty about the delay of the flight in the past. Similarly, the second clause \"it must have been rerouted\" also indicates a certainty about the rerouting of the flight in the past.\n\nSince both clauses express certainty about separate events that happened in the past, and there is no contradiction or alternative possibilities presented, we can infer that \"The flight must have been delayed and rerouted\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
