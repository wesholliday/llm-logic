            "content": "Explanation: This is a logical reasoning question that involves disjunctive syllogism, a form of argument in classical logic. The statement \"Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag\" is a disjunction, meaning it consists of two parts joined by \"or\". The negation of the first part, \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\", allows us to infer the second part, \"The sunglasses are in her bag\", because if the first part is false, the second part must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
