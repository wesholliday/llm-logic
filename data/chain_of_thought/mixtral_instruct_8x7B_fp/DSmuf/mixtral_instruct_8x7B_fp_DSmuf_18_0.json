            "content": "Explanation: This is a logical reasoning question that involves negation and disjunction (or). The statement \"Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer\" is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two options must be true. The second statement, \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand,\" is a negation, which denies the necessity of the notebook being on the nightstand.\n\nTo infer whether the notebook is in the drawer, we need to consider the possible truth values of the original disjunction. Since the second statement negates the possibility of the notebook being on the nightstand, we can conclude that the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
