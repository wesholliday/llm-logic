            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside' is a disjunction, meaning that it is true if either of its disjuncts is true. The disjuncts are 'Fido must be in the garden' and 'Fido is inside'.\n\nThe second statement, 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden', is the negation of the first disjunct. This means that the first disjunct, 'Fido must be in the garden', is false.\n\nSince the disjunction 'Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside' is true if either of its disjuncts is true, and we know that the first disjunct is false, it must be the case that the second disjunct, 'Fido is inside', is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'Fido is inside' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
