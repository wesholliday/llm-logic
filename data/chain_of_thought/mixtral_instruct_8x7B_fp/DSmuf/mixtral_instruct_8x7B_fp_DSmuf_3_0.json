            "content": "Explanation: This question involves logical reasoning using the concept of disjunction and negation in logic. \n\nThe statement \"Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer\" is a disjunction, meaning it states that one or the other (or both) of the two options must be true. \n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" negates the first part of the original disjunction, meaning that the keys cannot be definitely found dangling in the cabinet.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that the keys must be in the drawer. This is because the first statement presents two possibilities, and the second statement eliminates one of those possibilities, leaving only the other possibility.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
