(Let's denote this as P v C)\n\nAnd we are given that:\nIt's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom. (~P)\n\nFrom the law of negation, if ~P is true, then P is false. So, the cat cannot be playing in the bedroom.\n\nReturning to our original statement, if P (the cat playing in the bedroom) is false, then we are left with just one possibility in our disjunction: C (the cat napping on the couch).\n\nAnswer: Yes."
