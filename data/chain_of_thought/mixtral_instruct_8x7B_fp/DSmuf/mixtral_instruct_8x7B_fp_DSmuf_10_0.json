            "content": "Explanation:  The statement 'Either the missing sock must be under the bed or it's in the laundry basket' is a disjunction, meaning the missing sock could be in only one of these two places. \n\nThe negation of 'It must be under the bed' is 'It's not the case that it must be under the bed' or 'It could be somewhere else'. This doesn't necessarily mean the sock is in the laundry basket; it just means it's not required to be under the bed.\n\nHowever, since the disjunction states that the sock can only be under the bed or in the laundry basket, and we now know it's not under the bed, we can infer that it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
