            "content": "Explanation: This question involves logical reasoning using the concept of disjunction (or) and negation (not). \n\nThe statement \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf\" means that at least one of these two conditions is true. This can be represented as P \u2228 Q, where P represents \"the book must be resting on the table\" and Q represents \"it is on the shelf\".\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\" means that the first condition is false, which can be represented as \u00acP.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we want to infer whether Q is true, i.e., whether the book is on the shelf.\n\nSince the first condition (P) is false, and the original statement was an 'either or' statement, the second condition (Q) must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
