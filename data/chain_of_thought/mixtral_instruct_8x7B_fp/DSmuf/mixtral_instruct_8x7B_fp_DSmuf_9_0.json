            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box' is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two statements must be true. The negation of 'It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor' simplifies to 'The missing puzzle piece does not must be blending in on the floor', which still allows for the possibility that the piece is in the box. However, since the first statement tells us that the piece must be either blending in on the floor or in the box, and it has been confirmed that it's not blending in on the floor, it follows that the missing puzzle piece must be in the box.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
