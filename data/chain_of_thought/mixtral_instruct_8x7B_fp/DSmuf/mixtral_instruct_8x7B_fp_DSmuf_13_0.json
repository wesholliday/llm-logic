In this case, 'It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf' is equivalent to 'The toy must not be sitting on the bookshelf'.\n\nSo, now we have 'The toy must not be sitting on the bookshelf' and 'Either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box'. Since the first part is false, the second part must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
