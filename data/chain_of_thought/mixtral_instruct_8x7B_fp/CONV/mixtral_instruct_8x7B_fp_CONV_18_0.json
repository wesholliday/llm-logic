            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' is a conditional statement in the form of 'if p, then q'. This statement only asserts that if the condition p (doll is plastic) is true, then the consequence q (truck is metal) must also be true. It does not assert anything about the situation where the truck is metal. \n\nHowever, the statement we are asked to infer, 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic', is in the form 'if q, then p'. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. But the provided information does not allow us to make this inference directly. We can only infer 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic'.\n\nAnswer: No."
