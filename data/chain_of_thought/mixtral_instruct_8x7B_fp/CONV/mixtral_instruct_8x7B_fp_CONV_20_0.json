It can be represented as P -> Q, where P is 'the apple was red' and Q is 'the banana was yellow'.\n\nWhat we want to find out is if we can infer 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red' from this. This is represented as Q -> P.\n\nHowever, just because the original statement is true, it doesn't mean that its converse (Q -> P) is also true. For instance, consider a situation where the apple could be green and the banana could still be yellow. The original statement would hold true in this case, but the converse would not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red'.\n\nAnswer: No."
