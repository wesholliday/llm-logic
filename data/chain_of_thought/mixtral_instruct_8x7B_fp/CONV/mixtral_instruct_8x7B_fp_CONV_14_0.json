It means that if the condition (bear in the case) is true, then the consequence (wolf in the den) must also be true.\n\nHowever, just because the bear being in the case implies the wolf being in the den, it does not mean that the reverse is true. The statement 'If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case' is a different conditional statement.\n\nIn this case, there is no information given about what happens when the wolf is in the den, so we cannot infer that the bear must be in the case.\n\nAnswer: No."
