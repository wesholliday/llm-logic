            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' is a classic example of a material conditional in logic. It can be represented as:\n\n(R -> B)\n\nwhere R represents 'the car was red' and B represents 'the truck was blue'.\n\nThe statement we want to infer is 'If the truck was blue, then the car was red', or (B -> R).\n\nHowever, just because the original statement has an implication from R to B, it does not mean that the implication automatically holds in the opposite direction, from B to R. This is a common misconception in logic.\n\nIn other words, even if (R -> B) is true, (B -> R) could still be false. For example, consider the case where the car was actually green (not red), but the truck was indeed blue. In this case, the original statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' would still be true, but the inferred statement 'If the truck was blue, then the car was red' would be false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the truck was blue, then the car was red' based solely on the given statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'.\n\nAnswer: No."
