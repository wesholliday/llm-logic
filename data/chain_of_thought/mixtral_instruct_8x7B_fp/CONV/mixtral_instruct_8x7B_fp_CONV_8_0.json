It means that if a certain condition (the vampire being awake) is met, then a certain consequence (the mummy being awake) follows.\n\nHowever, just because the condition 'the vampire being awake' implies the consequence 'the mummy being awake', it does not mean that the converse is also true, i.e., the condition 'the mummy being awake' implies the consequence 'the vampire being awake'.\n\nThis is because there could be other conditions under which the mummy could be awake, such as if a werewolf was awake or if there was sunlight. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
