            "content": "Explanation: This statement is an example of a logical construct known as a conditional statement, which takes the form \"If P, then Q\". The statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" can be written as \"If griffin is in forest, then unicorn is in forest\" or in logical symbols as:\n\nP: griffin is in forest\nQ: unicorn is in forest\n\nIf P, then Q means that if the condition P is true, then the consequence Q must also be true. However, it does not imply that if Q is true, then P must also be true. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nTherefore, from the given statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\", we cannot infer \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest\".\n\nAnswer: No."
