What we want to find out is if the statement \"B implies A\" is true based on the given information.\n\nIn this case, the original statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" can be broken down into:\n1. Sue chose pizza (A)\n2. Bob chose pasta (B)\n\nFrom this, we cannot definitively say that \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza\" because there could be other possibilities where Bob chose pasta but Sue did not choose pizza. The original statement only tells us that Sue choosing pizza results in Bob choosing pasta, not the other way around.\n\nAnswer: No."
