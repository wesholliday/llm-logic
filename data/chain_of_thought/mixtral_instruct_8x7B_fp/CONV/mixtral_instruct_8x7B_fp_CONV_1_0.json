In this case, P represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q represents \"Sue was at the wedding\". \n\nThe statement as given is a one-way implication, meaning that it only tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, Sue was too. However, it does not tell us anything about what would happen if Sue was at the wedding. It's possible that Sue might always attend events where Mary is present, but it's also possible that Sue sometimes attends events without Mary.\n\nWithout further information, we cannot definitively say whether the reverse implication (\"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\") is true. We can only conclude that the original statement does not provide enough evidence to make this determination.\n\nAnswer: No."
