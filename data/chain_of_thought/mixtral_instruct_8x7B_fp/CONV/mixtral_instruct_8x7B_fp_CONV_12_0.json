The statement 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' is logically equivalent to 'Joe going to the park implies Lucy went to the zoo'. \n\nThe statement 'Joe going to the park implies Lucy went to the zoo' does not necessarily mean that 'Lucy going to the zoo implies Joe went to the park'. For example, it could be the case that Joe went to the park but Lucy didn't, or that Joe and Lucy both went to the park, or that Lucy went to the zoo for some other reason that doesn't depend on Joe's actions.\n\nAnswer: No."
