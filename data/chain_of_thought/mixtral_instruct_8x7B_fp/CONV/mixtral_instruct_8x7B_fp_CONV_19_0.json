            "content": "Explanation: This question is a test for the logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" The given statement, \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball,\" is in the form of a conditional statement, where the hypothesis (Tom watched football) leads to the conclusion (Jen watched basketball). However, just because the conclusion is true, it does not necessarily mean the hypothesis is also true. In other words, even if Jen did watch basketball, Tom might have been watching something else, not necessarily football. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
