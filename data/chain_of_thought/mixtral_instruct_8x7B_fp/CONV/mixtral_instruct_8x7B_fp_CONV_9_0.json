            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement in the form of \"if p then q\". This statement doesn't necessarily mean that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt. It only asserts that when Lisa bought the red shirt, Mark also bought the blue shirt. There could be other scenarios where Mark bought the blue shirt but Lisa didn't buy the red shirt. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
