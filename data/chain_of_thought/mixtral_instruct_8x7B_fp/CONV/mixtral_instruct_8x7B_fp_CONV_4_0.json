The statement does not provide information about what happens if q is true, so we cannot make any conclusions about the truth of \"if q then p\". In other words, just because if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter, it doesn't necessarily mean that if the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars. There could be other possible explanations for the robot visiting Jupiter, for example, the robot could have been sent by someone else or it could have been there for a different reason.\n\nAnswer: No."
