It can be written in logical notation as: P -> Q, where P represents 'the book was written by James' and Q represents 'the book is a mystery novel'. \n\nThe statement we are asked to infer is 'If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James', which in logical notation is: Q -> P. \n\nHowever, the original statement only tells us that if James wrote the book, it's a mystery novel. It does not tell us that if any book is a mystery novel, it was written by James. There could be mystery novels written by authors other than James. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: No."
