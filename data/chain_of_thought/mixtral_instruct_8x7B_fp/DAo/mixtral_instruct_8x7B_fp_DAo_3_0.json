The second statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' is a conditional statement, also known as an 'if-then' statement. This statement only allows us to make inferences when the condition (in this case, 'the book was written by James') is true. However, since we know that the book was not written by James, the condition is false. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that 'The book is not a mystery novel' based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No."
