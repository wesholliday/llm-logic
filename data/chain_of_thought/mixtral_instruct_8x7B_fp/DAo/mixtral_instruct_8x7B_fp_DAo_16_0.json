If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n\nWe want to find out if we can infer that the pants were not denim.\n\nTo do this, let's consider the second statement as a conditional statement: \"If the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim.\" This statement only allows us to make conclusions about the pants when the condition (the shirt being cotton) is met. However, in this case, the first statement tells us that the shirt is not cotton.\n\nSince the condition in the second statement is not met (the shirt is not cotton), we cannot make any conclusions about the pants based on the given information. The second statement does not tell us what the pants would be if the shirt were not cotton.\n\nAnswer: No."
