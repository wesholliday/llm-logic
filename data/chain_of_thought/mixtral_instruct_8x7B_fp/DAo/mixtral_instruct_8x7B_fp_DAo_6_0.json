This means that Sue's choice is something other than pizza.\n2. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Sue choosing pizza) is met, then the consequence (Bob choosing pasta) follows.\n3. However, since we know that Sue did not choose pizza, the condition of the second statement is not met.\n4. Without the condition being met, we cannot confirm whether Bob chose pasta or not.\n\nNow that we've examined the given information and conclusion, let's form our answer.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that Bob did not choose pasta. The initial statement 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta' does not provide information about Bob's choice when Sue does not choose pizza."
