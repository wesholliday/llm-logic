If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means it only applies if the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true. But in this case, we know from the first statement that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Therefore, the condition in the second statement is false.\n\nSince the condition in the second statement is false, the whole statement becomes vacuously true, but it doesn't help us determine whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not. However, it also doesn't provide any evidence that he did buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt'. We cannot make any conclusions about what Mark bought because the given information does not provide enough details about his shirt choices."
