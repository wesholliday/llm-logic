If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry (this is a conditional statement, also known as statement B).\n\nWe want to find out if we can conclude that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nTo use statement B to draw a conclusion, the condition (the cake being chocolate) must be met or not met. In this case, statement A tells us that the cake was not chocolate. \n\nSo, if the cake is not chocolate, the condition of statement B is not met. Therefore, we cannot infer the conclusion of statement B, which is 'the muffins were blueberry'.\n\nHowever, not being able to conclude that 'the muffins were blueberry' does not necessarily mean 'the muffins were not blueberry'. It just means we don't know anything about the muffins' color based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No."
