First, we know that \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" Then, we have an if-then statement that says, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer that \"Sue was not at the wedding,\" let's consider the truth of the if-then statement. If the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is false, as we know it is, then the whole statement becomes true automatically, regardless of the truth value of the consequence (Sue being at the wedding).\n\nHowever, this still doesn't let us conclude whether Sue was at the wedding or not. We can only be sure that the if-then statement is true because its condition is false.\n\nAnswer: No."
