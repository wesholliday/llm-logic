If the car was red, then the truck was blue. This statement is a conditional statement, which means it only applies if the condition (the car being red) is true.\n\nSince the first statement informs us that the car is not red, the second statement's condition is not met. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the color of the truck based on the second statement alone.\n\nBecause the color of the truck cannot be determined from the given statements, we also cannot determine whether or not the truck is blue or not blue.\n\nAnswer: No."
