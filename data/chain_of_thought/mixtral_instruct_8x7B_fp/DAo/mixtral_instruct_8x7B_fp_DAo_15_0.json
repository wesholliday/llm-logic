If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train (also given).\n\nTo determine if Erin did not take a train, let's consider the two possible scenarios regarding Sam taking a plane:\n\na) Sam took a plane: In this case, the second statement tells us that Erin took a train. However, since we know that Sam did not take a plane, this scenario does not apply.\n\nb) Sam did not take a plane (which is the case given): In this scenario, the second statement does not provide any information about Erin taking a train because the condition for Erin taking a train (Sam taking a plane) is not met.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that Erin did not take a train.\n\nAnswer: No."
