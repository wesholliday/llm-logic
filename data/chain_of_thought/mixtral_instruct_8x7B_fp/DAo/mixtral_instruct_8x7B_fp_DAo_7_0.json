Alex did not finish the race (A -> !F) where A is the event of Alex finishing the race and F is the event of finishing the race.\n2. If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (F -> C) where C is the event of Chris finishing the race.\n\nWe want to find out if we can infer that Chris did not finish the race, i.e., !C.\n\nThe given statements are in the form of logical implications. To combine them, we use logical conjunction (AND operation) because both statements must be true. The combined statement is:\n\nA -> !F AND F -> C\n\nThis combined statement doesn't directly let us infer !C. However, it's important to note that the second part of the conjunction (F -> C) doesn't affect the truth value of the whole statement if A is already false (which it is, according to the first statement). This is due to the principle of vacuous truth - a conditional statement is true when the condition (antecedent) is false.\n\nTherefore, even though we cannot definitively infer !C, the truth of the combined statement does not contradict !C.\n\nAnswer: No."
