The second statement is a conditional statement, also known as a hypothetical or 'if-then' statement. It tells us that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn is also in the forest.\n\nHowever, the statement does not tell us anything about where the unicorn is if the griffin is not in the forest. It only gives information about the relationship between the griffin and the unicorn when the griffin is in the forest.\n\nTherefore, from these two statements, we cannot infer that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: No."
