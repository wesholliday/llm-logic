The second statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' is a conditional statement, also known as a hypothetical or 'only if' statement. It means that Jen's watching basketball is dependent on Tom's watching football.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot infer that 'Jen did not watch basketball'. The reason is that the second statement only tells us about the condition under which Jen would watch basketball, not that she definitely did not watch it if Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: No."
