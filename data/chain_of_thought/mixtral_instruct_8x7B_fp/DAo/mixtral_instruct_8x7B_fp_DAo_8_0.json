The statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is a conditional statement. Its contrapositive is 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake'.  Given that the vampire was not awake, according to the contrapositive, it would mean that the mummy was not awake either.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
