This implies that the dog could be outside or somewhere else, but it is definitely not in the specified indoor location.\n2. If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part of the statement is true, then the second part must also be true.\n\nNow, let's think about the second statement in reverse. If the cat being outside is a consequence of the dog being inside, then it's reasonable to assume that if the dog is not inside, the cat's location is not restricted. In other words, the cat being outside is not guaranteed because the dog is not inside. The cat could still be outside, inside, or somewhere else entirely.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that 'The cat was not outside' based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No."
