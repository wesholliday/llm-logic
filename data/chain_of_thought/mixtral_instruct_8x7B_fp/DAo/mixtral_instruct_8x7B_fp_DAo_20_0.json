            "content": "Explanation: This question involves logical reasoning and the concept of inference. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, we have the statement 'The apple was not red'. This negates the possibility that the apple could be red.\n\nNext, we have 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'. This is a conditional statement, often referred to as an \"if-then\" statement. It means that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the consequence (the banana being yellow) must also be true.\n\nHowever, since we've already established that the apple is not red, the condition of the second statement is false. And when the condition of an \"if-then\" statement is false, the statement as a whole is considered to be true regardless of the truth value of the consequence.\n\nTherefore, this second statement doesn't provide any useful information about the color of the banana under the given circumstances.\n\nSince we have no information suggesting that the banana isn't yellow, we can't infer 'The banana was not yellow'.\n\nAnswer: No."
