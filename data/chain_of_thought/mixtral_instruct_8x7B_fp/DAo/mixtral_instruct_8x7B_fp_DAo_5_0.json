If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that Jeff did not participate in basketball. This means that the condition for the second statement is not met, because the condition was that Jeff played basketball. Since the condition is not met, it means that the second statement does not provide any information about what happened or did not happen with Amy and tennis.\n\nIn other words, since we already know that Jeff did not play basketball, the second statement (about Amy playing tennis if Jeff played basketball) doesn't apply here. It's as if the second statement doesn't exist in this context.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer whether Amy played tennis or not.\n\nAnswer: No."
