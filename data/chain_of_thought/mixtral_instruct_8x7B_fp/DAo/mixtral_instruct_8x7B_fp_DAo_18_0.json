However, since we know that the condition is false (the doll is not plastic), the truth of the consequence is not guaranteed. \n\nIn other words, just because the doll is not plastic, it doesn't necessarily mean that the truck is not metal. The given information is not enough to make a definitive statement about the material of the truck.\n\nAnswer: No."
