If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. (Statement B)\n\nWe want to find out if we can infer that the wolf was not in the den based on these two statements.\n\nTo do this, let's first analyze Statement B. It is a conditional statement, which means that it only applies when the condition (the bear being in the cave) is true. However, according to Statement A, the bear is not in the cave. As a result, the condition in Statement B is false, and therefore, the entire statement does not apply.\n\nSince Statement B does not apply, we cannot determine whether the wolf was in the den or not. We only know that the wolf's presence in the den is contingent on the bear being in the cave, which we now know is not the case.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the wolf was not in the den based on the given statements."
