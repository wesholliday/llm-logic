The second statement 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' is a conditional statement, also known as a hypothetical syllogism. It only tells us that if Joe had gone to the park, then Lucy would have gone to the zoo.\n\nHowever, since Joe did not go to the park, this second statement does not apply in this case. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about Lucy's whereabouts based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No."
