It's possible that one of the two conditions is true, but it's also possible that both could be true. However, the statement does not imply that the restaurant could not be both closed on Monday and open for limited hours at other times. It's possible that the restaurant could be open with limited hours on some days and closed on Mondays. Without further information, we cannot definitively say that the restaurant was closed on Monday.\n\nAnswer: No."
