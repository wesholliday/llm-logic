The word \"or\" in this context indicates that at least one of these possibilities must be true.\n\nHowever, the statement does not exclude the possibility that the book could have been in both places at different times. Nonetheless, if we are to make a deduction based solely on the information given, we cannot definitively conclude that the book was on the shelf, because it could have been in the library instead.\n\nAnswer: No."
