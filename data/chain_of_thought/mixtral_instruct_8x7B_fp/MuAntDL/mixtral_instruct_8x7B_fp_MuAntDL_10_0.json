            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been signed or notarized\" presents two possible scenarios: either the document was signed, or it was notarized. Notarization is a process that often requires a document to be signed in the presence of a notary public, but it is not the only way a document can be notarized. In some cases, a document can be notarized through other means, such as by using a notary stamp on a previously signed document. However, the fundamental requirement for notarization is still the signing of the document, even if it's not done directly in front of the notary.\n\nTherefore, if the only options are for the document to be signed or notarized, and notarization inherently involves signing the document, then the inference that \"The document must have been signed\" is a valid conclusion.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
