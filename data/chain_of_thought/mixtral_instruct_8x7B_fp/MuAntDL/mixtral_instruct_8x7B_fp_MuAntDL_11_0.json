In order to infer that the software must have been updated, we need to be able to rule out the possibility that it was reinstalled instead. Without additional context or information, we can't definitively say that the software was updated and not reinstalled. Therefore, we cannot infer that the software must have been updated based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
