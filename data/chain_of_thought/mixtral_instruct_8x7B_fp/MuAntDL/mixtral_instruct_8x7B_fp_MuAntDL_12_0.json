            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday or extended\" presents two possible scenarios: the project was completed by Friday, or the project was extended. The \"or\" in this context is inclusive, meaning that either of the two scenarios is possible. However, the question asks if we can infer that the project was completed by Friday specifically. Without additional information, we cannot definitively conclude that the project was completed by Friday and not extended. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The project must have been completed by Friday\" based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
