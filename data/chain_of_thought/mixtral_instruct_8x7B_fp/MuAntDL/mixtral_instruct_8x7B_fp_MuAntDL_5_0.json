If we want to determine if we can infer that it was definitely delivered yesterday, we need to consider if there are any other possibilities.\n\nIn this case, the only other possibility is that the package was delivered the day before yesterday. If we don't have any additional information to rule out this possibility, then we cannot definitively say that the package was delivered yesterday.\n\nAnswer: No."
