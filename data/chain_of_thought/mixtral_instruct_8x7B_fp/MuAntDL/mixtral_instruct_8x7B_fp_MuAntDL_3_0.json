However, the statement 'The keys must have been in the drawer' is a categorical claim that the keys were only in the drawer.\n\nWithout further information, we cannot definitively conclude that the keys were in the drawer. It's possible that they were on the table, or that they were in both places. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The keys must have been in the drawer' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
