In order to infer that the meeting must have been at 2 PM, we would need to have information that eliminates the possibility of the meeting being cancelled. Without additional context or information, we cannot definitively conclude that the meeting took place at 2 PM. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that 'The meeting must have been at 2 PM'.\n\nAnswer: No."
