            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument known as modus ponens, where we have a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' and another statement that affirms the condition 'P'. In this case, the conditional statement is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim', and the second statement is 'The pants were denim'. If the conditional statement is true and the second statement is true, then the first statement 'The shirt was cotton' must also be true. This is because if the pants being denim necessarily follows from the shirt being cotton, then the pants being denim implies that the shirt is cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
