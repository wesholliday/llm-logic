            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of logical reasoning using if-then statements, also known as conditional statements. The original statement is in the form \"If P, then Q\". Here, P represents \"the book was written by James\" and Q represents \"the book is a mystery novel\". \n\nWe are given that Q is true, i.e., the book is a mystery novel. We want to find out if we can conclude that P is true, i.e., the book was written by James. \n\nIn general, knowing that Q is true does not guarantee that P is true. This is because there could be other reasons why the book is a mystery novel. However, in some cases, it might be that James is the only author who writes mystery novels in which case knowing that the book is a mystery novel would imply that James wrote it. But this additional information is not provided in the question.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The book was written by James'.\n\nAnswer: No."
