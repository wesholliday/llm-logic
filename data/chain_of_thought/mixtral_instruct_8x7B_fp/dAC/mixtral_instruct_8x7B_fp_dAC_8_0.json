            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of logical reasoning using conditional statements. The statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is in the form of a conditional statement, often called a hypothesis. The part of the statement that says 'the vampire was awake' is called the antecedent, and the part that says 'the mummy was awake' is called the consequent.\n\nGiven the second statement, 'The mummy was awake', we want to determine if we can conclude 'The vampire was awake'. \n\nTo do this, we need to consider the possibility that there might be other reasons that the mummy could be awake, other than the vampire being awake. However, the given conditional statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' does not allow for this possibility. It specifically states that the only condition under which the mummy is awake is when the vampire is awake.\n\nTherefore, if the mummy is awake, as stated in the second sentence, then the vampire must also be awake, as stated in the conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
