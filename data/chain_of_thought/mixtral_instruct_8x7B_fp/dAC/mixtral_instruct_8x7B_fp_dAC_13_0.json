            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical reasoning problem using conditional statements. The original statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is in the form of a conditional statement P -> Q, where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue\". \n\nThe second statement is \"The truck was blue\", which matches part of the conditional statement. However, to determine if the car was red, we need to consider the condition under which the truck being blue is true. \n\nIn this case, the condition is that the car was red. But we don't have any information about the color of the car, so we cannot definitively say that the car was red. It's possible that the car was red, but it's also possible that the car was some other color.\n\nAnswer: No."
