            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical deduction using the concept of transitive inference. The statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' is a conditional statement, often written as \"doll is plastic -> truck is metal\". The second statement is \"truck is metal\". \n\nTo determine if we can deduce 'The doll was plastic', we look at the conditional statement and see if the condition (the doll being plastic) is what leads to the result (the truck being metal). Given that the truck is indeed metal, the only way this could be true based on our conditional statement is if the doll is plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
