This means that Mary's presence at the wedding guarantees Sue's presence, but it doesn't work the other way around - Sue could have been at the wedding for some other reason.\n\nHowever, we are also told that Sue was at the wedding. Given this, it's possible that Sue was at the wedding for the same reason Mary was (i.e., the wedding itself), so Mary might have been there too.\n\nBut this isn't certain - it's still possible that Sue was there for another reason, and so we can't definitively say that Mary was at the wedding based on this information alone.\n\nAnswer: No. While it's plausible that Mary was at the wedding, we can't be sure based on the given information."
