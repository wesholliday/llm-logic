            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument in the form of a conditional statement, often referred to as \"modus ponens.\" The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is the conditional statement, also known as the 'if-then' statement. The second statement, \"The banana was yellow,\" is a factual statement. \n\nTo determine if we can deduce 'The apple was red', we need to examine if the given statements support this conclusion. According to the first statement, the condition for the apple being red is that the banana was yellow, and the second statement confirms that the banana was indeed yellow. Therefore, all conditions for the apple to be red, as stated in the first statement, are met.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
