This means that the two events are connected - if the first one happens, so does the second one. However, it doesn't directly tell us what happens when the second condition is true while the first one might not be.\n\nBut in this case, we also know that Chris did indeed finish the race. Given the connection between Alex and Chris's finishes described in the conditional statement, it would be unusual for Chris to finish without Alex also finishing, unless the statement was only meant in one direction (which it doesn't specify). So, common sense and the information given suggest that if Chris finished, then Alex likely finished as well.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
