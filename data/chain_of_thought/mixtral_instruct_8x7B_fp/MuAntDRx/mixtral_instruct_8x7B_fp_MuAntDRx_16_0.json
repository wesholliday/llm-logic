It states that the wozzle could be one of two things: flibbit floob or flibbit blimple. To infer that \"The wozzle must be flibbit blimple,\" we would need some additional information that rules out the possibility of the wozzle being flibbit floob. Without such information, we can't definitively make that inference.\n\nAnswer: No."
