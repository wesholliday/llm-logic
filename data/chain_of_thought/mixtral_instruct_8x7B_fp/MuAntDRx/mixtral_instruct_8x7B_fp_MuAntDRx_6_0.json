It states that the floob must be one of two things: zibber zizz or bimboozle. However, it does not explicitly state that the floob cannot be both or that it must only be bimboozle. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The floob must be bimboozle\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No."
