            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The quorple must be quazzle or quorple\" is a disjunction, meaning it presents two possible options for what the quorple could be: quazzle or quorple. However, the second option is the same as the subject of the sentence, which makes the first option redundant. Therefore, we can infer that the quorple must be a quorple, because if it weren't, it would have to be a quazzle, which is explicitly stated as one of the options.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
