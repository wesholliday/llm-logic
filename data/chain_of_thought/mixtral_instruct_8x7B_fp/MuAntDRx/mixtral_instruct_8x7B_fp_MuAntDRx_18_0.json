This means that either of the two scenarios could be true, but not necessarily both. The two scenarios are:\n1. The frazzle is snork with gribble.\n2. The frazzle is on an blimple grooble.\n\nSince we cannot assume that both conditions are true based on the information given, we cannot automatically infer that 'The frazzle must be on an blimple grooble'. It's possible, but we would need additional context or information to confirm this.\n\nAnswer: No."
