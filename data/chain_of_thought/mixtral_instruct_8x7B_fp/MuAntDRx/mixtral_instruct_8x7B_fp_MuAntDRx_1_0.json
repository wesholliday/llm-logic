However, it does not explicitly state that the grazzle cannot be more than one of these things, so it's possible that the grazzle could be both a frazzle and one of the other options.\n\nHowever, without further information, we cannot definitively say that the grazzle must be a frazzle. It's possible, but not certain.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that 'The grazzle must be frazzle' based on the given statement."
