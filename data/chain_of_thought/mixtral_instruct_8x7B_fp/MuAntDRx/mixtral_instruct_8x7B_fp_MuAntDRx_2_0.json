The statement 'The wozzle must be in the plimp' is a different statement, which asserts that the wozzle is definitely in the plimp, not on the blimp.\n\nWithout further information, we cannot infer that the wozzle must be in the plimp. It is possible that the wozzle could be on the blimp instead. The original statement only tells us that the wozzle is in one of those two places, but it does not specify which one.\n\nAnswer: No."
