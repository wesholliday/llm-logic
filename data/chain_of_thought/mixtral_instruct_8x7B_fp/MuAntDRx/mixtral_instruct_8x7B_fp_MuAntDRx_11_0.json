In this case, the disjunction is 'The snizzle must be quank or quazzle'. \n\nHowever, even though the statement 'The snizzle must be quank or quazzle' implies that at least one of the two possibilities must be true, it does not specifically point to 'The snizzle must be quazzle' being true. It's possible that 'The snizzle must be quank' is true instead. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The snizzle must be quazzle' based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
