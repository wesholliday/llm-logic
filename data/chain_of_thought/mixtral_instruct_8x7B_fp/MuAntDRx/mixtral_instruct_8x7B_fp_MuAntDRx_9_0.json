In this case, the statement is saying that the blurble must be either plonk or on blimple. However, the statement does not explicitly state that the blurble cannot be plonk, only that it must be one or the other. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that 'The blurble must be on blimple'.\n\nAnswer: No."
