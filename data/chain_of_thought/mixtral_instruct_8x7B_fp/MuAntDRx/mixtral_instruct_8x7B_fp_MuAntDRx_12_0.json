            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The wobble must be floob by wozzle or crunk' can be broken down into two parts: 'The wobble must be floob by wozzle' and 'The wobble must be crunk'. The first part can be further broken down into 'The wobble must be floob' and 'The floobbing must be done by wozzle'. However, the original statement does not specify that the wobble being crunk is dependent on it being floobbed by wozzle. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The wobble must be crunk' based on the given statement.\nAnswer: No."
