It does not explicitly state that the pen is not in the bag, but rather that it's not required to be there. However, this does imply that there is a possibility for the pen not to be in the bag, because if it's not necessary for it to be there, then it could be elsewhere. Therefore, based on this given information, we can infer that the pen might not be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
