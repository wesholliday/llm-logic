This does not directly confirm that Jeff might not have played basketball, but it also does not rule out this possibility. The statement is neutral and leaves open the question of whether Jeff played basketball or not.\n\nHowever, in the absence of any other information, we can infer that there is a possibility that Jeff did not play basketball. This is because the original statement only denies the necessity or certainty of Jeff playing basketball, but it does not exclude the possibility of him not playing.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that Jeff might not have played basketball."
