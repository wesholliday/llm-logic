This opens up the possibility that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt, but it doesn't definitively confirm it. We can only infer that there is a possibility of her not buying the red shirt, not that she definitely didn't.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt."
