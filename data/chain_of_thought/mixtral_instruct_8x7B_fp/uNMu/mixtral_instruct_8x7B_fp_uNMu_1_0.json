            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" implies that it is possible that Mary was not at the wedding. This is because the word \"must\" is often used to indicate necessity or obligation, and its negation (\"must not\" or \"it's not the case that\") suggests the absence of such necessity or obligation. Therefore, the statement suggests that Mary's presence at the wedding was not required or inevitable.\n\nFrom this reasoning, we can infer that Mary might not have been at the wedding, since the statement explicitly allows for that possibility.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
