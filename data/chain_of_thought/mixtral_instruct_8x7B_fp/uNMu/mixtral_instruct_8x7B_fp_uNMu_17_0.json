This does not definitively mean that the scarf is not in the backpack, but it does imply that the scarf being in the backpack is not a certainty or a given. Therefore, it is possible that the scarf is not in the backpack, but we cannot say for sure without more information.\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that the scarf might not be stuffed in the backpack."
