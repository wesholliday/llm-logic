            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence uses the conjunction \"or\" to connect two phrases, \"The quibble must be floob on the froodle\" and \"be snork on the zump\". However, it does not specify how the quibble cannot be both floob on the froodle and snork on the zump at the same time.\n\nTo clarify this ambiguity, we can add the word \"must\" before \"be snork on the zump\" to indicate that it is another requirement for the quibble, making the sentence \"The quibble must be floob on the froodle or it must be snork on the zump\". This makes the sentence more explicit and eliminates any potential confusion.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
