The flim must quazzle a frazzle\n2. The flim must quazzle a glorp\n\nThe word \"or\" in this context is used as a logical disjunction, meaning that only one of the two options needs to be true. \n\nTo determine if the reformulated statement \"The flim must quazzle a frazzle or it must quazzle a glorp\" is logically equivalent to the original statement, we need to consider whether the use of \"it\" in the reformulated statement correctly refers to the second option.\n\nIn this case, the use of \"it\" in the reformulated statement does correctly refer to the second option, making the reformulated statement logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
