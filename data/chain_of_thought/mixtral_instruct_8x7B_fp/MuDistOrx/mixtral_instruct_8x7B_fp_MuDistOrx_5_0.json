            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The plonk must be on wibble or on shimble\" is a logical disjunction, meaning that it consists of two possible scenarios connected by the word \"or\". The first scenario is \"The plonk must be on wibble\", and the second scenario is \"on shimble\". \n\nWhen we see the word \"or\" in a logical statement like this, it can mean either the exclusive \"or\" (meaning only one of the scenarios can be true) or the inclusive \"or\" (meaning that one or both of the scenarios can be true). In this case, the inclusive \"or\" is more likely, since there is no indication that only one of the scenarios can be true.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"The plonk must be on wibble or it must be on shimble\" is a valid way to paraphrase the original statement, since it conveys the same meaning using slightly different wording.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
