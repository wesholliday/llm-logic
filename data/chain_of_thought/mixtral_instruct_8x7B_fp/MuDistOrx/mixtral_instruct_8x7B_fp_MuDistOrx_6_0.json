            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence \"The blimp must gribble a flonk or gribble a wibble snorkel\" is written in a simplified form, which is grammatically correct but less explicit. The phrase \"gribble a flonk or gribble a wibble snorkel\" is a conjunction of two actions that the blimp must perform. To make the sentence more explicit, we can add the word \"it\" and separate the two actions with the word \"or\", making it clear that the blimp has two options.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
