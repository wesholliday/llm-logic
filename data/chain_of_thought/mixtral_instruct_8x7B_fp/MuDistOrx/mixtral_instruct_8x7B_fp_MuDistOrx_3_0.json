However, the statement provided for us to consider has the word \"on\" only once, and instead of it, we have \"in\" which suggests that the wumble is located inside something.\n\nHowever, we cannot assume that \"in\" means the same as \"on\" in this context, nor can we assume that \"shimble\" refers to something that can contain something else. The words \"frozz\" and \"shimble\" are not standard English words, so we cannot rely on our usual understanding of them.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The wumble must be on the frozz or it must be in the shimble\" from the original statement \"The wumble must be on the frozz or in the shimble\".\n\nAnswer: No."
