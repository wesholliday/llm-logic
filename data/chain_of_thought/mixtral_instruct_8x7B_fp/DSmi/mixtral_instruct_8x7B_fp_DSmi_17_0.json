Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack (P or Q).\n2. The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack (not Q).\n\nWe want to find out if we can infer that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack (P). \n\nGiven the second statement, the scarf might not be on the coat rack, but it doesn't exclude the possibility of the scarf being in the backpack. However, this alone is not enough to definitively conclude that the scarf is in the backpack. \n\nHowever, since the first statement presents only two possibilities for the location of the scarf, and the second statement tells us that the scarf is not on the coat rack, it leads us to conclude that the scarf must be in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
