However, it does not necessarily mean that both statements cannot be false. In this case, the second statement 'The book might not be resting on the table' introduces a possibility, not a certainty. It does not rule out the possibility that the book could be on the shelf. However, it also does not confirm it. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The book is on the shelf'.\n\nAnswer: No."
