However, it does not rule out the possibility that the remote control could be somewhere else.\n\nThe statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" does not directly contradict the first statement, but it does introduce a new possibility - that the remote control might not be under the couch, but could still be somewhere else.\n\nTherefore, from these two statements, we cannot definitively infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\". It is possible, but not certain.\n\nAnswer: No."
