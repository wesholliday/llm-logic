This means that at least one of these two conditions must be true.\n\nIn the second statement, 'The smonk is not plagged', we have a negation of the second condition.\n\nSince the first statement only requires at least one of the conditions to be true, and the second statement negates one of the conditions, this leaves us with the first condition being true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The smonk is vreebled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
