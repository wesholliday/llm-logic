In this case, the options are 'the wug is sproinged' and 'the wug is garpled'. \n\nThe second statement, 'The wug is not garbled', negates one of the options in the disjunction. If the wug is not garbled, then the only option left in the disjunction is 'the wug is sproinged'. \n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can indeed infer 'The wug is sproinged'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
