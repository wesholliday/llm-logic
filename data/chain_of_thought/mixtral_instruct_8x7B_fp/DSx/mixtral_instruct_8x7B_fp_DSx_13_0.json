Along with this, we have the additional information that 'The glip is not tragged'. Since the original statement only provides two possibilities for the state of the glip, and we now know that one of those possibilities (the glip being tragged) is not the case, it follows that the other possibility (the glip being slogged) must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
