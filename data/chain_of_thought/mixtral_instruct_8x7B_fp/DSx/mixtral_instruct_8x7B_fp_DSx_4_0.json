Given a set of premises, if we can derive a conclusion that must be true whenever the premises are true, then we have a valid argument. \n\nIn this case, the given premises are:\n1. Either the fribble is snurgled or it is crinked (in symbolic logic: S v C)\n2. The fribble is not crinked (in symbolic logic: ~C)\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'The fribble is snurgled' (S), we need to see if S is a logical consequence of our premises. \n\nFirst, let's look at premise 1. It states that at least one of two things is true: the fribble is snurgled or it is crinkled. This is a disjunction (represented by 'v'), which means that it's true if at least one of its parts is true.\n\nNext, consider premise 2. It asserts that the fribble is not crinkled (the negation of C, represented by '~C').\n\nNow, if the fribble is not crinkled, then the only way for premise 1 to be true is for the fribble to be snurgled. Therefore, given these premises, we can indeed infer that 'The fribble is snurgled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
