Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked (this is a disjunctive statement, meaning one or the other or both could be true).\n2. The splat is not quanked (this negates the second possibility in the disjunctive statement).\n\nGiven these two statements, we can indeed infer that 'The splat is morphed'. This is because, since the splat is not quanked, the only remaining possibility from the disjunctive statement is that it is morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
