The second statement given is \"The dreb is not spened\", which negates the second possibility in the disjunction. Since the second possibility is not true, and at least one of the possibilities must be true, it follows that the first possibility, \"The dreb is vroombed\", must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
