            "content": "Explanation: In the given statement, 'Either the shank is plooked or it is nugged' is a disjunction, meaning that the shank can be in one of two states - it can be plooked or nugged. The second statement, 'The shank is not nugged', is a negation of the second disjunct. Taken together, these two statements imply that the shank must be in the first state, since it cannot be in the second state. Therefore, we can infer that 'The shank is plooked'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
