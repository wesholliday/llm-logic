This is an example of a logical disjunction, which means that only one of the conditions needs to be true. \n\nWhen we are told that 'The zinger is not smoogled', we are being told that the second condition is not true. Therefore, by process of elimination, the first condition must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
