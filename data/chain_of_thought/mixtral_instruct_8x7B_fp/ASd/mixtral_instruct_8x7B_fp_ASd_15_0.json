However, the modified statement \"If I charge my phone and it has a dead battery, it will have power\" introduces an additional condition, which is that the battery is dead. This additional condition is not mentioned or implied in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the modified statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
