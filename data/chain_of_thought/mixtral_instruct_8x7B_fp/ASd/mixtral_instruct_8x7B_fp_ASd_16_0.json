            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'If I fertilize the lawn, it will be lush and green' implies that fertilizing the lawn leads to a lush and green lawn under normal conditions. However, it does not explicitly state or imply that this result would hold true in all conditions, such as during a drought. A drought would cause water shortage, which could prevent the lawn from becoming lush and green even if it is fertilized. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green'.\n\nAnswer: No."
