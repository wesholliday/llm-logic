However, it does not account for other factors that could influence weight loss, such as diet. In the second statement, 'If I exercise and eat junk food, I will lose weight', the addition of eating junk food is actually contradictory to the idea of losing weight, because junk food is high in calories and can hinder weight loss. Therefore, we cannot infer that if you exercise and eat junk food, you will lose weight.\n\nAnswer: No."
