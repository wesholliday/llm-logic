            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If you fill up the gas tank, the car will run\" implies that if the gas tank is full, the car will be able to run. However, this statement does not specify any other conditions that might affect the car's ability to run. In particular, it does not mention anything about the possibility of a hole in the gas tank.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from the original statement that \"If you fill up the gas tank and there is a hole in it, the car will run.\" In fact, if there is a hole in the gas tank, the car is unlikely to run even if the tank is filled with gas, because the gas will leak out through the hole.\n\nAnswer: No."
