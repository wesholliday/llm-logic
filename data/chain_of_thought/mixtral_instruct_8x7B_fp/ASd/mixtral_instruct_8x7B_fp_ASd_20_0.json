However, this does not necessarily mean that taking expired medication will also lead to feeling better. In fact, taking expired medication can be harmful or ineffective, which may prevent one from feeling better. Therefore, the original statement cannot be used to infer the effect of taking expired medication.\n\nAnswer: No."
