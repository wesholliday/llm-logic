            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'If I water the plants, they will grow' implies that water is a necessary condition for the plants to grow. However, it does not specify whether sunlight is also a necessary condition. The inference 'If I water the plants and there is no sunlight, they will grow' is adding an additional condition (no sunlight) that was not present in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot definitively make this inference based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
