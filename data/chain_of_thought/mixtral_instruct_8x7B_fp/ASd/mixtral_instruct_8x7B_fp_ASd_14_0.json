The inferred statement \"If I study hard and the test is in Chinese, I will pass the test\" adds an additional condition, which is the test being in Chinese. Even if the test is in Chinese, studying hard does not guarantee that the test will be passed, as the person might not know Chinese or the test might be too difficult. Therefore, the original statement does not imply the inferred statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
