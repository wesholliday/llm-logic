However, this doesn't mean that if the car is in the garage and any other condition exists, the car will still be safe. Specifically, for the case of the garage flooding, this new information changes the situation significantly. The original statement does not account for any other factors that might affect safety, so we cannot infer that the car would still be safe if the garage is flooding.\n\nAnswer: No."
