            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'If the match is struck, then it will light' only guarantees that a match will light when struck under normal conditions. If the match has been soaked in water, this represents a significant change in conditions. A soaked match may never light, regardless of how many times it is struck, because water prevents the chemical reaction necessary for ignition. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will light' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
