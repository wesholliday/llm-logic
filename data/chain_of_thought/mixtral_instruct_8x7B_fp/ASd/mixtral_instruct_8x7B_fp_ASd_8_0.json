This new condition was not part of the original statement and could potentially impact the delivery date. \n\nEven if a package is shipped, if it's misrouted, it might not be able to arrive on the same day due to the extra time needed to correct the routing error. Therefore, we cannot infer the extended statement without additional information about how misrouted packages are handled in terms of delivery times.\n\nAnswer: No."
