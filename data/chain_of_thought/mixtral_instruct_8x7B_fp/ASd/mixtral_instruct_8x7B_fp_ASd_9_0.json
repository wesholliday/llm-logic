            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A' implies that a well-written essay is a necessary and sufficient condition for getting an A. However, the statement 'If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A' includes an additional condition, being turned in late. Without further information, we cannot assume that a late essay, even if well-written, will still receive an A. The teacher may have a policy against late submissions, or there may be other factors at play. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: No."
