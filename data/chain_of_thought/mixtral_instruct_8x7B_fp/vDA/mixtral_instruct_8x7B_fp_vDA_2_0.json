            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called modus ponens inverted, and it is logically valid. The argument is in the form \"If P, then Q; not P; therefore not Q.\" If the first premise is true (if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest), and the second premise is true (the griffin was not in the forest), then the conclusion must also be true (the unicorn was not in the forest). This is because the second premise negates the condition of the first premise, which means that the conclusion must also be negated.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
