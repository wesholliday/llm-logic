            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called modus tollens in classical logic. The general form is \"If P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\" In this case, P represents \"the dog was inside\" and Q represents \"the cat was outside\". The second premise \"the dog was not inside\" is the negation of P. The conclusion \"the cat was not outside\" is the negation of Q. If the first premise is true, then the argument is logically valid. However, the truth of the premises themselves is a separate issue from the logical validity of the argument.\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid."
