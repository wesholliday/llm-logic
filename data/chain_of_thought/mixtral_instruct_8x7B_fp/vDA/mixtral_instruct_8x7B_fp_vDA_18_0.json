            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as transitive syllogism or hypothetical syllogism. The argument is valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. In this case, the first premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. The second premise negates the condition of the first premise by stating that the doll was not plastic. Therefore, based on the first premise, if the condition (doll being plastic) does not hold, then the consequent (truck being metal) also should not hold. Hence, the conclusion that the truck was not metal follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
