            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as transitive inference in logic, where if A implies B and B implies C, then A implies C. In this case, the first premise 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' can be rewritten as 'Sam taking a plane implies Erin taking a train'. The second premise 'Sam did not take a plane' means we can infer that 'Sam taking a plane is false'. Given these two premises, we can use transitive inference to conclude that 'Erin did not take a train'. This is because if Erin taking a train is true only when Sam takes a plane, and Sam taking a plane is false, then Erin taking a train must also be false.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
