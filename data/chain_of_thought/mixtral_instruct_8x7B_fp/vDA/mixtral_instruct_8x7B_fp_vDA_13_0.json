            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as Modus Tollens in formal logic. The general form is: \"If P, then Q. Not P. Therefore, not Q.\" In this case, the premises can be translated as: P = \"the car was red\", Q = \"the truck was blue\". The first premise \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is equivalent to \"P -> Q\". The second premise \"The car was not red\" is equivalent to \"not P\". Therefore, the conclusion \"The truck was not blue\" is equivalent to \"not Q\". Since all the steps follow the rules of Modus Tollens, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
