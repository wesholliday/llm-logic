            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as modus tollens in logic, where the general form is \"If P, then Q. Not P. Therefore, not Q.\" In this case, the first premise \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" can be restated as \"P implies Q.\" The second premise \"The apple was not red\" can be restated as \"not P.\" Therefore, the conclusion \"The banana was not yellow\" can be restated as \"not Q.\" Since the argument follows the structure of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
