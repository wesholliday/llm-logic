The argument is set up as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If P, then Q (in this case, if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den)\nPremise 2: Not P (in this case, the bear was not in the cave)\nConclusion: Therefore, not Q (in this case, the wolf was not in the den)\n\nHowever, just because the bear was not in the cave does not necessarily mean that the wolf was not in the den. The wolf could still be in the den even if the bear is not in the cave. The argument fails to consider this possibility, making it an invalid form of reasoning.\n\nAnswer: No."
