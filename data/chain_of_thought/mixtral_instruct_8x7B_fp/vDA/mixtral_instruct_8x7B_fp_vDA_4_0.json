            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called a contrapositive, which is a logically equivalent form of a conditional statement. The original conditional statement is \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\" The second premise negates the antecedent of the conditional statement, stating \"The alien did not visit Mars.\" Therefore, according to the rules of logical equivalence, we can infer the consequent of the conditional statement, which is \"The robot did not visit Jupiter.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
