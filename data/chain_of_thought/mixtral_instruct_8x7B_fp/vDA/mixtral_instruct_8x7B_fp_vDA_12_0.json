            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called modus tollens, which is a valid form of deductive reasoning. The argument can be represented as:\n\nPremise 1: If P, then Q\nPremise 2: Not P\nConclusion: Therefore, not Q\n\nIn this case, P represents \"Joe went to the park\" and Q represents \"Lucy went to the zoo\". Since the argument follows the structure of modus tollens, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
