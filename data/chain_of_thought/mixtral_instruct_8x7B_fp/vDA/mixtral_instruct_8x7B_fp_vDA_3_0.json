            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is an example of a hypothetical syllogism, which is a valid form of argument in deductive logic. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If P, then Q\nPremise 2: Not P\nConclusion: Therefore, not Q\n\nIn this case, P represents \"the book was written by James,\" and Q represents \"the book is a mystery novel.\" The first premise asserts that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. The second premise asserts that the book was not written by James. From these two premises, the argument concludes that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nThis form of argument is valid because it is logically impossible for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true. If the book was not written by James, then it cannot be a mystery novel (assuming the first premise is true). Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
