            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is an example of a hypothetical syllogism, where the conclusion follows logically from the given premises. The argument can be represented as:\n\nPremise 1: If P, then Q\nPremise 2: Not P\nConclusion: Therefore, not Q\n\nIn this case, P represents 'the cake was chocolate' and Q represents 'the muffins were blueberry'. Since the first premise states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry, and the second premise states that the cake was not chocolate, it logically follows that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
