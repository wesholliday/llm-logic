            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called modus ponens in reverse, or denying the antecedent. The argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. In this case, the first premise states that Mary's presence at the wedding implies Sue's presence. The second premise denies the presence of Mary at the wedding. Given these two premises, the conclusion that Sue was not at the wedding cannot be logically inferred. This is because even if Mary was not at the wedding, it does not necessarily mean that Sue was also absent. There could be other reasons for Sue's presence at the wedding, independent of Mary's attendance. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No."
