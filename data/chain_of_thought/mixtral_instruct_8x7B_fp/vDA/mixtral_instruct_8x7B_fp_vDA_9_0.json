            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as denying the antecedent in logic, which makes it invalid. The argument's structure can be represented as:\n\nPremise 1: P \u2192 Q (If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt)\nPremise 2: \u00acP (Lisa did not buy the red shirt)\nConclusion: \u00acQ (Mark did not buy the blue shirt)\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, denying the antecedent (P) does not necessarily mean that the consequent (Q) is false. In this case, even if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, it doesn't definitively mean that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. There could be other reasons Mark bought the blue shirt. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, making the argument invalid.\n\nAnswer: No."
