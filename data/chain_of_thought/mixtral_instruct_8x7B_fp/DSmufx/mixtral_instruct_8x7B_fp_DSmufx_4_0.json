If we also know that 'It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked', then we can infer that the fribble is not required to be crinked. However, this does not necessarily mean that the fribble is snurgled. It is possible that the fribble could be neither crinked nor snurgled.\n\nHowever, in this case, we are given the additional information that the only two possibilities are that the fribble is crinked or snurgled. Therefore, if the fribble is not required to be crinked, then it must be snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
