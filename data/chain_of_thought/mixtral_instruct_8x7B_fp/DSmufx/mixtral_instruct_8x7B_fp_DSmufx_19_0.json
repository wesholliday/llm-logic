It does not necessarily mean that only one of these conditions can hold true, i.e., it could be the case that neither condition holds, or both conditions hold.\n\nHowever, in this case, we are also told 'It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged'. This negates the first possibility in the 'Either ... or' statement, leaving us with only one possibility: 'it is vreebled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
