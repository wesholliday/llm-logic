The second statement is \"It's not the case that the clug must be snugged,\" which is the negation of the first part of the first statement. This means that the first statement is false, so the second part of the first statement must be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The clug is fleeked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes."
