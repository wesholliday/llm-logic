If we know that \"It's not the case that the flob must be movated\", then we can infer that the second part of the disjunction, \"it is skizzled\", must be true. This is an application of the logical principle known as \"Reductio ad absurdum\", where we assume the opposite of what we want to prove, and then show that this assumption leads to a contradiction.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
