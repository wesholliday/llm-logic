The second statement \"It's not the case that the shank must be nugged\" means that it is not necessary for the shank to be nugged, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that the shank could be nugged.\n\nHowever, since we are given the information that it's not the case that the shank must be nugged, we can infer that the shank is not nugged in this scenario. Therefore, since the only other possibility mentioned in the first statement is that the shank is plooked, we can indeed infer that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
