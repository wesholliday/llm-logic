            "content": "Explanation: This question involves logical reasoning and the concept of inference. We are given two statements:\n\n1. \"Either the wug must be garbled or it is sproinged.\"\n2. \"It's not the case that the wug must be garbled.\"\n\nThe first statement presents two possibilities for the wug's state: garbled or sproinged. The second statement negates the first part of the first statement, meaning that the wug is not necessarily in the garbled state.\n\nNow, let's analyze these statements to see if we can infer that the wug is sproinged. If it's not the case that the wug must be garbled, it means that the wug could be in the sproinged state or in some other state that is neither garbled nor sproinged. The statement \"Either the wug must be garbled or it is sproinged\" only allows for two possibilities, and since we've ruled out the garbled state, the remaining possibility is that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
