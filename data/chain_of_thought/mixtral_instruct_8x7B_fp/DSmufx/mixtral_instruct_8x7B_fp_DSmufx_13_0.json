If it's not the case that the glip must be tragged, as stated in the second sentence, then it must be the case that the glip is slogged. This is an application of the principle of logical exclusion, which states that if one hypothesis is shown to be false, then any other hypothesis that is logically incompatible with the first hypothesis must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
