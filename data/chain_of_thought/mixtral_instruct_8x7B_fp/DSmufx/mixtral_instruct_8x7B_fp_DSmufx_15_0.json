            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"Either the dreb must be spended or it is vroombed\" can be broken down into two parts: \"the dreb must be spended\" and \"it is vroombed\". The negation of the statement \"It's not the case that the dreb must be spened\" means that the dreb does not have to be spent. Since the first part of the original statement \"the dreb must be spended\" is not true, the only remaining part of the original statement that can be inferred is \"it is vroombed\". Therefore, we can infer that \"The dreb is vroombed\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
