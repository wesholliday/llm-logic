The smip must be lupped (let's call this statement A)\n2. The smip is shripped (let's call this statement B)\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the smip must be lupped\" is the negation of statement A.\n\nTo infer statement B from these given statements, we would need to establish that statement A is false and that statement B is true. However, the given statements only allow us to conclude that statement A is false. We cannot definitively say that statement B is true based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No."
