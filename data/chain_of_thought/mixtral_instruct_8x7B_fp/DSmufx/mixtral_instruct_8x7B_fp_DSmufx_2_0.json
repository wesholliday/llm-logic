The negation of \"The wug must be bimmed\" is \"It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed\", which means that it is false that the wug must be bimmed. This does not exclude the possibility that the wug is flooped. Therefore, based on this information, we can indeed infer that \"The wug is flooped\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
