Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked (this is a disjunction, meaning one or the other is true).\n2. It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled (meaning the first option in the disjunction is false).\n\nNow, let's analyze this step by step:\n- If it's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled, then the only option left in the disjunction is that the sprocket is cranked.\n- In other words, if the sprocket cannot be both not daggled and not cranked, then it must be cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
