This means that both conditions must be true for the statement to be true as a whole. The first condition is \"The room must have been cleaned daily\". The second condition is \"had fresh towels\". Since both conditions must be true, we can infer that the first condition \"The room must have been cleaned daily\" is true based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
