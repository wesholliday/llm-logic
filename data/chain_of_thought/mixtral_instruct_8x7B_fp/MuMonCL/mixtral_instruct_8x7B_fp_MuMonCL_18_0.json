Therefore, the requirement for the medicine to be taken with food is a separate condition that applies to each individual dose. Since the original statement specifies that the medicine must be taken with food at each instance, it can be inferred that \"The medicine must have been taken with food,\" regardless of the frequency of dosage.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
