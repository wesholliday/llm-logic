The first idea is \"The exam must have been difficult\". The second idea is \"covered all chapters\". A conjunction connects two ideas and implies that both are true. Therefore, if the second part of the statement is true, that the exam covered all chapters, then it is reasonable to infer that the first part of the statement is also true, that the exam must have been difficult.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
