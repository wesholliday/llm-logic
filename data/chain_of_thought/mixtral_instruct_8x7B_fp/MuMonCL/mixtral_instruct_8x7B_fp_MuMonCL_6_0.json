            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM' is a conjunction, meaning it combines two separate ideas with the word 'and'. In order to infer 'The concert must have been sold out', we need to be sure that this part of the statement is not dependent on the other part ('started at 8 PM'). However, the statement does not provide any information that links being sold out to the start time. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The concert must have been sold out' based solely on this statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
