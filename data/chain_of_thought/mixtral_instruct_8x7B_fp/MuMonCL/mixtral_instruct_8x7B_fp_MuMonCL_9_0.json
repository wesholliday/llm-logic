            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The flight must have been delayed and rerouted' implies that two things happened to the flight: it was delayed and it was rerouted. 'Delayed and rerouted' are connected by the conjunction 'and', which indicates that both of these things happened. \n\nIf the flight was indeed rerouted, it's reasonable to assume that there was some sort of disruption to the original flight plan. A delay is one possible disruption that could lead to a rerouting. Therefore, if the flight was rerouted, it's highly likely that it was also delayed.\n\nHowever, while it's highly likely, it's not 100% certain. There could be other reasons for a reroute that don't involve a delay. For example, a change in weather conditions at the destination airport might require the flight to land at a different airport, even if it's on time.\n\nBut in this case, since we are only considering the information given and not speculating about other possible scenarios, we can infer that the flight was likely delayed.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
