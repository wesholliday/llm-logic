            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays and served Italian cuisine' is composed of two pieces of information: 1) the restaurant was closed on Mondays, and 2) the restaurant served Italian cuisine. Both of these pieces are connected by the word 'and', which indicates that they are separate facts. Therefore, the truth of the second fact (Italian cuisine) does not affect the truth of the first fact (closed on Mondays). Since the first fact can stand alone as true, we can infer 'The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays'.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
