            "content": "Explanation: The phrase \"The contract must have been valid for a year and renewable\" implies that the contract was valid for a year initially. The term \"renewable\" means that the contract can be extended after its initial term. However, the renewal of the contract does not affect the validity of its initial term. Therefore, the validity of the contract for a year can be inferred independently from the renewability of the contract. Answer: Yes, we can infer that \"The contract must have been valid for a year.\""
