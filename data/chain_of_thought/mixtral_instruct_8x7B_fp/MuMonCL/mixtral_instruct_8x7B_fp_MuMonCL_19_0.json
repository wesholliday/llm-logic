            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The application must have been completed online and included references\" is a compound requirement. It includes two separate requirements joined by the word \"and\". The first requirement is \"The application must have been completed online\". The second requirement is \"included references\". The word \"and\" indicates that both requirements must be true for the entire statement to be true. However, the truth of the second requirement (references were included) does not depend on the truth of the first requirement (application completed online). Therefore, it is possible for the first requirement to be true on its own, even if the second requirement is also true. So yes, we can infer that 'The application must have been completed online' based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
