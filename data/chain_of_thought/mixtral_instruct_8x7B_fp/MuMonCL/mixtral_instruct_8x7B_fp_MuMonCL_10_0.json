Notarization is a process that typically requires a document to have been signed first, as the notary public serves to verify the identity of the signatory and confirm that they are signing voluntarily and with an understanding of the document's contents. Therefore, if a document has been notarized, it is a strong indication that it was previously signed. In this case, the statement \"The document must have been signed and notarized\" implies that the document was indeed signed, even if the statement does not explicitly say so.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
