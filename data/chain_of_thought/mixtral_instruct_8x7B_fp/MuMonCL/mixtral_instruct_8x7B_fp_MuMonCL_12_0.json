            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday and under budget\" is a compound requirement, meaning both components must be true. The components are connected by the word \"and\", which indicates that the completion by Friday and being under budget are two necessary conditions. However, the truth of the whole statement does not necessarily mean that each individual component is true. In this case, the first component \"The project must have been completed by Friday\" is indeed a separate requirement, and it is not dependent on the second component \"under budget\". Therefore, we can infer that the project must have been completed by Friday.\nAnswer: Yes"
