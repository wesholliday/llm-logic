It does not necessarily mean that the signing was witnessed or authenticated by a notary public. Notarization is a separate process that confirms the identity of the signer and ensures they are signing voluntarily, among other things. Therefore, the original statement does not include the requirement for notarization.\n\nAnswer: No."
