The phrase \"and rerouted\" is not included in the original statement, so we cannot infer that the flight was also rerouted. It is possible that the flight was delayed but then continued on its original route, or it could have been delayed and then rerouted, but the original statement does not allow us to make that determination. Answer: No."
