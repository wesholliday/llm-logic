However, it does not provide any details about the restaurant's operating days or any other aspects of its operation.\n\nThe second statement \"The restaurant must have been closed on Monday and served Italian cuisine\" includes the information about the type of cuisine served but also adds the detail that the restaurant was closed on Mondays. This is additional information not present in the original statement.\n\nWithout specific evidence or context suggesting that the restaurant was indeed closed on Mondays, we cannot infer this from the given information about the restaurant serving Italian cuisine.\n\nAnswer: No."
