However, it does not explicitly state where the car was during this time. It's possible that the car was in a garage being repaired, but it's also possible that it was being repaired somewhere else, or that the repairs haven't been done yet. Without additional information, we cannot definitively say that the car was in the garage.\n\nAnswer: No."
