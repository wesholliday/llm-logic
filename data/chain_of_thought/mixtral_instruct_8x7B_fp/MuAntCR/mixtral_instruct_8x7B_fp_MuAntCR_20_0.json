It does not necessarily imply that the event was formal. The event could have been a casual gathering like a music concert or a sports match, which often require tickets for entry but are not necessarily formal. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The event must have been formal and required tickets' based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No."
