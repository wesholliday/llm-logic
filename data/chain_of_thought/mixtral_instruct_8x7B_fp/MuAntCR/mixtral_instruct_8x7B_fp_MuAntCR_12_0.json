It does not provide any information about when the project was completed. Therefore, we cannot infer that the project must have been completed by Friday and been under budget. It is possible that the project was completed before, on, or after Friday, and it is also possible that the project was completed while being under budget, on budget, or even over budget, as long as it was ultimately under budget.\n\nAnswer: No."
