Therefore, based on this statement alone, we cannot infer that \"The exam must have been difficult and covered all chapters.\" It is possible that the exam covered all chapters but was still easy, or that it was difficult but did not cover all chapters. Without additional information, we cannot make a definitive conclusion about the difficulty of the exam. Answer: No."
