It does not provide any information about why it was restarted or if any updates were applied during that time. Without this additional information, we cannot infer that the software \"must have been updated and restarted.\" It is possible that the software was restarted for reasons unrelated to updates, such as fixing a bug or addressing a system error. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that the software was both updated and restarted based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No."
