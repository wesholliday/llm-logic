            "content": "Explanation: Notarization is a legal process that involves a notary public verifying the identity of a person signing a document and ensuring that they are entering into the transaction knowingly and willingly. The act of notarization typically includes the signer signing the document, but the phrase \"the document must have been notarized\" only implies that a notary public has officially witnessed and verified the signature and the signer's identity. However, it does not explicitly state that the document was signed in front of the notary at the time of notarization. It is possible that the document was signed beforehand, but still needed to be notarized.\n\nThat being said, it is a common practice for documents to be signed in the presence of a notary public during the notarization process. This ensures that the notary public can confirm the signer's willingness and awareness, and that the signature is indeed that of the person named in the document. In many cases, notaries may even require the signer to sign the document in their presence to meet their legal obligations.\n\nTherefore, while the phrase \"the document must have been notarized\" does not explicitly state that the document was signed in front of the notary, it is highly likely that the document was indeed signed during the notarization process.\n\nAnswer: Yes, it is highly likely that the document must have been signed and notarized."
