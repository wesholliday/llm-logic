We don't have any information about other characteristics of the zizz, such as whether it could also be a quank or a glorp. In order to conclude that the zizz must also be a quank and a glorp, we would need additional information stating that a zizz can be both a wump and a quank and a glorp. Without this information, we cannot infer that the zizz must be a quank and a glorp based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
