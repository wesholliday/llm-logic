However, this statement does not provide any information about other properties the plimp may or may not have. The statement \"The plimp must be fribble and zump\" would imply that a plimp is not only fribble but also zump. Since the original statement does not provide any information about the plimp being zump, we cannot infer that it is true.\n\nAnswer: No."
