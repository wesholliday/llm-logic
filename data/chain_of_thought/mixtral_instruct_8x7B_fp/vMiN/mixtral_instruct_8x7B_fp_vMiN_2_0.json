            "content": "Explanation: The argument is valid because it follows the rule of inference known as negation introduction or not-both-A-and-not-A. This rule states that if a statement A is possibly not true (in this case, \"the griffin might not have been in the forest\"), then it is logically equivalent to saying that it is not necessarily true that A is the case (in this case, \"it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\"). This form of argument is a valid form of modus ponens, where the negation of the conclusion is equivalent to the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
