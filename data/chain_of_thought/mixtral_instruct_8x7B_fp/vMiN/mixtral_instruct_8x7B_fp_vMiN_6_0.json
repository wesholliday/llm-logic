The argument can be represented in a logical form as:\n\nPremise: Maybe ~P (Sue didn't choose pizza)\nConclusion: Therefore, ~(Sue must have chosen pizza)\n\nHowever, this argument is not logically valid. The premise \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" only suggests that Sue had other options, but it doesn't necessarily mean that Sue didn't choose pizza. The conclusion \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" is a stronger claim, suggesting that Sue definitely didn't choose pizza.\n\nTo make the argument valid, the premise should be \"Sue didn't choose pizza\" (or its equivalent), which would make the conclusion \"Sue didn't have to choose pizza\" (or its equivalent).\n\nAnswer: No."
