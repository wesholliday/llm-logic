            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called the fallacy of denying the antecedent, which is a type of informal fallacy. The argument can be represented in a logical form as:\n\nPremise: Maybe ~P (Mary wasn't at the wedding)\nConclusion: Therefore, ~(M must be P) (It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding)\n\nHowever, this argument is not logically valid. The premise \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" only suggests that there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding. It does not exclude the possibility that Mary could have been at the wedding. Therefore, the conclusion \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: No."
