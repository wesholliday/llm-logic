This is because the premise 'Jeff might not have played basketball' implies that there is a possibility that he did not play, which contradicts the idea that he must have played. Therefore, the conclusion 'it's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball' is a logical consequence of the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
