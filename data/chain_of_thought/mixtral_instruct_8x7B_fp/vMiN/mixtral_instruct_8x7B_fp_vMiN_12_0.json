However, this is not logically valid. The premise talks about the possibility of the jacket not being on the chair, but it does not rule out the possibility of the jacket being on the chair in other instances. Therefore, the conclusion that the jacket must never be on the chair is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No."
