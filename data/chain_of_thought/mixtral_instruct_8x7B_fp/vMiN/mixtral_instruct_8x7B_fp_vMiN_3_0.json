            "content": "Explanation: The argument is a form of modus tollens in classical logic. The negation of the conclusion is 'It is the case that the book must have been written by James', which is equivalent to 'The book was necessarily written by James'. The premise is 'The book might not have been written by James', which is equivalent to 'It is possible that the book was not written by James'. If it is possible that the book was not written by James, then it cannot be necessarily true that the book was written by James. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
