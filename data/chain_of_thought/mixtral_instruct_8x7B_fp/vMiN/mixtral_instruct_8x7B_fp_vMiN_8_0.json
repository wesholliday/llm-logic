            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is logically valid due to the principle of contrapositive in logic. The contrapositive of a statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. In this case, the premise 'The vampire might not have been awake' can be interpreted as 'If it's not the case that the vampire must have been awake', which is the contrapositive of 'If the vampire is awake, then he must be awake'. Since the argument's form is a contrapositive, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
