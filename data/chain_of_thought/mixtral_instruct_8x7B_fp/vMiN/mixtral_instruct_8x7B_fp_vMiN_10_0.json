It is a valid argument form where the conclusion negates the necessity of the statement in the premise. In this case, if it's possible that the dog was not inside (premise), then it cannot be the case that the dog must have been inside (conclusion). This is because if there is a possibility of the dog not being inside, then it contradicts the idea that the dog had to be inside.\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
