This form of argument is logically valid. \n\nThe argument is as follows:\n\nPremise: It might be false that Alex finished the race (symbolized as: \u00acP, where P represents 'Alex finished the race').\nConclusion: Therefore, it's not the case that Alex must have finished the race (symbolized as: \u00acBox P).\n\nIn this argument, the negation of the claim \"Alex finished the race\" is used to infer the negation of the claim \"Alex must have finished the race.\" This is a valid inference, as the negation of a claim implies the negation of any stronger claim based on it.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
