If we consider the statement 'The alien might not have visited Mars', it means that it's possible that the alien did not visit Mars (possibility of the alien's non-visit to Mars is not ruled out). The conclusion 'It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars' is the negation of the necessity of the alien's visit to Mars, which is indeed the case if the possibility of the alien's non-visit to Mars is admitted. Hence, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
