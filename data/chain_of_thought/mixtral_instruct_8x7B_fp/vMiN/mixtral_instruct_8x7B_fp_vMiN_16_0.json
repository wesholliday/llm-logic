However, this does not rule out the possibility that the pen could be in the bag at other times or under different circumstances. The conclusion 'It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag' asserts that it is impossible for the pen to always be in the bag, which is a stronger claim than what the premise supports.\n\nAnswer: No."
