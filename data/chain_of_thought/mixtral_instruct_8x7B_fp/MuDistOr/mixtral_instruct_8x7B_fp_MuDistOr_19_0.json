The candidate must have had a degree.\n2. The candidate must have had relevant work experience.\n\nThese two conditions are joined by the word \"or\", which means that only one of these conditions needs to be true for the overall statement to be true. \n\nTo infer the statement \"The candidate must have had a degree or they must have had relevant work experience\", we are simply restating the original statement in a different way by separating the two possible conditions. This restated form is logically equivalent to the original statement, as both conditions are still required to be true individually.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
