The reformulated statement \"it must have contained a number or it must have contained a special character\" has the same meaning as the original statement. It's still a logical disjunction and the two conditions are not required to be fulfilled simultaneously. Therefore, the two statements are equivalent.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
