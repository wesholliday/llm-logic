            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The exam must have been multiple choice or essay-based\" is a form of a compound conjunctive statement, where two conditions are joined by the word \"or\". This \"or\" can be exclusive or inclusive. Exclusive \"or\" means only one of the conditions can be true, while inclusive \"or\" means one or both of the conditions can be true. In this case, the context does not specify that only one of the conditions must be true, so we should interpret it as an inclusive \"or\".\n\nTherefore, when we want to break down the statement into separate sentences, we should maintain the inclusive nature of the \"or\". Hence, the equivalent form would be \"The exam must have been multiple choice\" or \"it must have been essay-based\", which means that the exam could have satisfied either one of these conditions, or both.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
