This is because the word \"or\" is used, which typically indicates a choice between two options. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the statement is equivalent to \"The document must have been signed or it must have been notarized,\" which also presents the two options as being mutually exclusive.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
