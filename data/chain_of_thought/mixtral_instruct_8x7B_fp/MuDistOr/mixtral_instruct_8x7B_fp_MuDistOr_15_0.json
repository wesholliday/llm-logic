            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The movie must have been in English or subtitled\" can be interpreted in two ways: (1) the movie was in the English language, or (2) the movie was in a different language but had English subtitles. To make this statement clearer, we can break it down into two separate statements: \"The movie must have been in English\" or \"The movie must have been subtitled.\" This clarifies that the movie was either in English or it had subtitles, but not necessarily that it was in English and had subtitles at the same time.\nAnswer: Yes."
