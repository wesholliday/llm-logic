            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The meal must have included a salad or soup\" can be broken down into two possible scenarios: the meal included a salad, or the meal included soup. This is because the word \"or\" in this context is being used as a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. Therefore, the statement can be rephrased as \"The meal must have included a salad or it must have included soup.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes."
