            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The flight must have been delayed or cancelled\" is a compound sentence that contains an inclusive 'or', which means that one or both of the conditions (delayed or cancelled) may have occurred. The statement can be expanded into \"The flight must have been delayed or it must have been cancelled\" to emphasize the two separate conditions, but the meaning of the original statement is not altered. Therefore, the two statements are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
