The payment was made using a credit card.\n2. The payment was made via bank transfer.\n\nTo determine if the expanded version \"The payment must have been made by credit card or it must have been made by bank transfer\" is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can examine each possibility:\n\n1. If the payment was made using a credit card, then the expanded version is satisfied since one of its possibilities is met.\n2. If the payment was made via bank transfer, then the expanded version is also satisfied since the other possibility is met.\n\nSince both possibilities in the original statement are covered by the expanded version, we can infer that the two statements are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
