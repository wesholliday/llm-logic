Both forms of the statement convey the same meaning, which is that the product in question has two possible characteristics: it is either eco-friendly or recyclable. Therefore, we can infer that \"The product must have been eco-friendly or it must have been recyclable\" is a valid interpretation of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
