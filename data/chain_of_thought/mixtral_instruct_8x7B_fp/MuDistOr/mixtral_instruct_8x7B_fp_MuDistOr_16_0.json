            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The contract must have been approved by the legal team or the CEO\" can be broken down into two distinct possibilities: 1) the contract was approved by the legal team, or 2) the contract was approved by the CEO. The use of \"or\" in this context indicates that at least one of these conditions must be met for the contract to be valid. Therefore, the statement can be rephrased as \"The contract must have been approved by the legal team or it must have been approved by the CEO\" without changing the meaning, as this explicitly separates the two possibilities. Answer: Yes."
