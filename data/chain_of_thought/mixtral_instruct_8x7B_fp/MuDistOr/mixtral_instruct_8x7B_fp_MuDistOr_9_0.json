            "content": "Explanation: The initial statement \"The package must have been delivered by truck or by plane\" can be broken down into two distinct parts: \"The package must have been delivered by truck\" or \"by plane\". This structure is equivalent to saying \"The package must have been delivered by truck\" or \"it must have been delivered by plane\". The word \"it\" is used as a substitute for the previously mentioned \"package\", and the use of \"or\" in both cases indicates that either of the two options is a valid possibility for the delivery of the package. Therefore, the inferred statement is logically equivalent to the original one.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
