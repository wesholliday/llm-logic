This means that the keys could be in either location, but not necessarily both. When we expand the statement to \"The keys must have been in the drawer or they must have been on the hook,\" we are simply repeating the original statement using different words. The meaning and structure of the sentence remain unchanged.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
