The software must have been installed on the computer.\n2. The software must have been accessed through the cloud.\n\nThe conjunction \"or\" in the statement indicates that at least one of these conditions must be true. To infer the expanded version of the statement, we need to ensure that both possibilities are still exclusive of each other. By adding \"it must have been\" before the second possibility, we maintain the original meaning of the statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
