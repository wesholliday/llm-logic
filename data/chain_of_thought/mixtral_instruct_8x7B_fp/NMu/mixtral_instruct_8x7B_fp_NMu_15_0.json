            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet\" is denying that it is necessary or certain that the shoes are in the closet. This implies that there is a possibility that the shoes are not in the closet. The word \"must\" in the original statement indicates obligation or certainty, so negating it opens up the possibility for the shoes to be elsewhere. Therefore, we can indeed infer that 'The shoes might not be in the closet'.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
