It implies that there could be other possibilities where Lisa didn't buy the red shirt. \n\nThe statement \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\" is expressing uncertainty or possibility that Lisa didn't buy the red shirt. \n\nSince both statements convey the same uncertainty or possibility about Lisa not buying the red shirt, we can infer one from the other.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
