It implies that there is a possibility she didn't choose pizza. \n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" is expressing a possibility or uncertainty about Sue's choice. It suggests that there is a chance she didn't choose pizza.\n\nSince both statements convey a similar meaning, we can infer 'Sue might not have chosen pizza' from 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza'.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
