            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars\" is denying the necessity or certainty of the alien's visit to Mars. It implies that there could be other possibilities where the alien did not visit Mars. \n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"The alien might not have visited Mars\" is expressing uncertainty or possibility about the alien's non-visit to Mars. \n\nThese two statements are conveying similar meanings, but the latter one is more directly expressing the idea of uncertainty. However, since the original statement does not explicitly rule out the possibility of the alien not visiting Mars, it implies this uncertainty as well.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer 'The alien might not have visited Mars' from 'It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars'.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
