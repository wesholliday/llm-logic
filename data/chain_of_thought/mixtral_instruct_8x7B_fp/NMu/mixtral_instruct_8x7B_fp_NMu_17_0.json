This implies that there could be other possibilities where the scarf is not in the backpack. \n\nThe statement \"The scarf might not be stuffed in my backpack\" is expressing uncertainty about whether the scarf is in the backpack or not. It suggests that there is a possibility that the scarf is not in the backpack.\n\nSince both statements convey the idea of uncertainty and the possibility of the scarf not being in the backpack, they are logically equivalent. Therefore, we can infer 'The scarf might not be stuffed in my backpack' from 'It's not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack'.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
