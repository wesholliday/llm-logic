This implies that there could be other possible locations for the sunglasses. When we say \"The sunglasses might not be in her bag,\" we are expressing uncertainty or possibility of the sunglasses not being in her bag. Since both statements convey a sense of uncertainty or possibility about the location of the sunglasses, they can be considered logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
