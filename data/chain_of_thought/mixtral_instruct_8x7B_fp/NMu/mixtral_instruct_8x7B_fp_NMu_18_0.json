It means it's possible for the notebook to be somewhere else other than the drawer. \n\nThe statement \"The notebook might not be in the drawer\" expresses uncertainty about whether the notebook is in the drawer or not, implying that there's a possibility it's not in the drawer.\n\nBoth statements convey similar meanings, namely that there is a possibility that the notebook is not located in the drawer. Therefore, we can infer 'The notebook might not be in the drawer' from 'It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer'.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
