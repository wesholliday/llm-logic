It's a way of saying that it's possible Jeff didn't play basketball, but it doesn't rule out other possibilities. \n\nThe statement \"Jeff might not have played basketball\" is expressing uncertainty or possibility about Jeff playing basketball. It suggests that there's a chance Jeff didn't play, but it also allows for the possibility that he did.\n\nGiven these meanings, the answer to the question is yes. The initial statement implies that there's a possibility Jeff didn't play basketball, which is exactly what the second statement is saying.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
