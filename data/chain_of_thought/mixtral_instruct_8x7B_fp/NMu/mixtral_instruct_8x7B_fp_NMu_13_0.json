It implies that there is no rule or requirement that forces the toy to be in the toy box.\n\nWhen we negate the necessity of something, we are opening up the possibility of its absence. Therefore, this statement can be interpreted as there being a possibility that the toy is not in the toy box.\n\nTo express this idea more explicitly, we can rephrase it as \"The toy might not be in the toy box,\" which conveys the same concept of uncertainty and possibility.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
