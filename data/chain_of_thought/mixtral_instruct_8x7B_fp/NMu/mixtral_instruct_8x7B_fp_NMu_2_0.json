It implies that there could be other possibilities where the griffin is not in the forest. \n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"The griffin might not have been in the forest\" is expressing uncertainty or the possibility of the griffin not being in the forest.\n\nSince both statements convey a similar idea - the possibility of the griffin not being in the forest - we can infer one from the other.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
