            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim' is a conditional statement in the form of 'if p, then q'. This statement only tells us about the situation when the shirt is cotton and the pants are denim. It doesn't give any information about what happens when the shirt is not cotton.\n\nThe statement we are asked to infer is 'If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim', which is in the form of 'if not p, then not q'. This is called the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide enough information to infer its contrapositive. In other words, just because the pants are denim when the shirt is cotton, it doesn't necessarily mean that the pants are not denim when the shirt is not cotton. There could be situations where the pants are still denim even when the shirt is not cotton.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim' from 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'.\n\nAnswer: No."
