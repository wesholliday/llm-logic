The original statement is:\n\nIf Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n\nThis can be represented as:\n\nSue (pizza) -> Bob (pasta)\n\nThe question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which would be:\n\nnot(Bob (pasta)) -> not(Sue (pizza))\n\nOr in other words, if we can infer that if Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nTo determine if this is a valid inference, we need to consider the truth values of the original statement and its contrapositive. In general, for any conditional statement \"If P, then Q\", its contrapositive \"If not-Q, then not-P\" is logically equivalent. This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nIn this case, the original statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" does not provide enough information to determine whether or not Bob would still choose pasta if Sue did not choose pizza. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether the original statement and its contrapositive are both true or false.\n\nHowever, since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, if we assume that the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, if \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is true, then \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes, if we assume that the original statement is true."
