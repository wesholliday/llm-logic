            "content": "Explanation: This question is an example of a logical concept known as contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement (if P, then Q) is (if not Q, then not P). If the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. \n\nIn this case, the original statement is \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\". The contrapositive would be \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\". \n\nHowever, the given statement does not allow us to directly infer the contrapositive. We can only infer the contrapositive if we know that the original statement is true. Without knowing whether or not the cake is chocolate or the muffins are blueberry, we cannot definitively say that if the muffins are not blueberry, then the cake is not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: No."
