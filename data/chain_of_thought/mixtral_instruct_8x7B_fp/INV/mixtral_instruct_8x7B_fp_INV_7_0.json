The original statement is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This can be rewritten as \"If Chris didn't finish the race, then Alex didn't finish the race\" by changing the subject of the sentence and negating both parts of the statement. This new statement is the logical contrapositive of the original statement. Since these two statements are logically equivalent, we can also say \"If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes."
