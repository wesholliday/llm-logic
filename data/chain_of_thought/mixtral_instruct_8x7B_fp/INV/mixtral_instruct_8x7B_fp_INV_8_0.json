This statement does not give information about what happens when the vampire is not awake. To infer 'If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake', we need the original statement to be biconditional, which means it should be in the form of 'if and only if'. However, based on the given information, we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No."
