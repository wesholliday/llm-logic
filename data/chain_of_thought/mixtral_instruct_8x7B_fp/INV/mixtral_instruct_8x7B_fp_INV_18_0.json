            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' is a conditional statement in the form of 'if p, then q'. The negation of p is 'the doll was not plastic'. The contrapositive of the original statement is 'if the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic'. However, the statement we are asked to infer is 'if the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal'. This is not the contrapositive of the original statement, but it is logically equivalent to the contrapositive. \n\nAnswer: Yes."
