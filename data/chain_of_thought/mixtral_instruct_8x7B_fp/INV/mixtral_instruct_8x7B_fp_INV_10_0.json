            "content": "Explanation: This question is a variation of the logical concept called contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". \n\nIn this case, \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" can be rewritten as \"If the dog is not outside, then the cat is inside\" (we reversed P and Q because the original statement used a negative form, \"was inside\", and we want the contrapositive to be in a positive form). \n\nThe statement we are asked to infer is \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside\", which can be rewritten as \"If the dog is outside, then the cat is not inside\". \n\nThis is not the same as the contrapositive of the original statement, but it is equivalent to it in terms of logical meaning. \n\nAnswer: Yes"
