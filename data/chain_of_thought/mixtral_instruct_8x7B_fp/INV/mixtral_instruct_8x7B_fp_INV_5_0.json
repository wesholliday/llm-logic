            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement in the form 'if p then q'. The converse of this statement would be 'if q then p', which is not given. However, the statement we are asked to infer is the contrapositive of the given statement, which is 'if not q then not p'. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nTo determine if the given statement implies its contrapositive, we can use the truth table for the material conditional 'if p then q', which is:\n\n| p | q | p -> q |\n|---|---|-------|\n| T | T |   T   |\n| T | F |   F   |\n| F | T |   T   |\n| F | F |   T   |\n\nWe can see that for any given values of p and q, the material conditional 'if p then q' is true unless p is true and q is false. \n\nNow, let's consider the truth table for the contrapositive 'if not q then not p':\n\n| p | q | not p | not q | not q -> not p |\n|---|---|-------|-------|--------------|\n| T | T |   F   |   F   |      T       |\n| T | F |   F   |   T   |      T       |\n| F | T |   T   |   F   |      F       |\n| F | F |   T   |   T   |      T       |\n\nWe can see that the contrapositive 'if not q then not p' has the same truth values as the original statement 'if p then q' for any given values of p and q. Therefore, the given statement implies its contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
