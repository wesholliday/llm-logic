In this case, P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\". \n\nThe statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" does not allow us to infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This is because the original statement only tells us what happens when Lisa buys the red shirt, but it doesn't tell us anything about what happens when she doesn't buy it. \n\nAnswer: No."
