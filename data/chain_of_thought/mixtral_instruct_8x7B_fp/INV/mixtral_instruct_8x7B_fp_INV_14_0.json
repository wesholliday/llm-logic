            "content": "Explanation: This statement is an example of a logical construct known as a contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'if P, then Q' is 'if not Q, then not P'. In this case, P is 'the bear was in the cave' and Q is 'the wolf was in the den'. The contrapositive of the given statement is therefore 'if the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave'. Since this is equivalent to 'if the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den', we can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
