            "content": "Explanation: This conditional statement is a classic example of a logical argument form known as \"contrapositive.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P.' \n\nIn this case, 'P' is 'Joe went to the park' and 'Q' is 'Lucy went to the zoo.' The given statement is 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.' Therefore, its contrapositive is 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.'\n\nHowever, the statement we want to infer is the converse of this contrapositive, which is 'If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.'\n\nThe converse of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If Q, then P.' While the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, its converse is not.\n\nTo determine if the converse is true, we would need additional information because knowing that if one event implies another does not necessarily mean that the absence of the second event implies the absence of the first.\n\nAnswer: No."
