            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical statement in the form of a conditional statement, or an \"if-then\" statement. The original statement is:\n\nIf Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nThis can be written in logical notation as:\n\nTom watches football -> Jen watches basketball\n\nThe statement you're asking about is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then swapping their positions. So the contrapositive of the original statement is:\n\nIf Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\n\nHowever, this is not what you've asked. You've asked if we can infer:\n\nIf Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nThis is the inverse of the original statement, not the contrapositive. The inverse and the contrapositive are not equivalent, so we cannot directly infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nTo determine whether the inverse is true, we would need additional information. In other words, we would need to know whether there are any situations where Tom does not watch football but Jen still watches basketball. Without this information, we cannot definitively say whether the inverse is true or false.\n\nAnswer: No."
