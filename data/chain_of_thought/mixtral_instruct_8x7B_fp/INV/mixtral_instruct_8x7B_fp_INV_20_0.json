            "content": "Explanation: This question is a variation of the logical concept called contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". In this case, P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow\". \n\nThe given statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is logically equivalent to the contrapositive \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\". However, the statement we are asked to infer is \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\", which is not the same as the contrapositive but rather the inverse.\n\nThe inverse of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not P, then not Q\". While the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, the inverse is not necessarily so. \n\nIn this case, the original statement does not allow us to directly infer the inverse because it doesn't tell us what happens to the banana when the apple is not red. There could be other reasons for the banana not to be yellow even when the apple is not red.\n\nAnswer: No."
