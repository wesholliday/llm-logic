            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical inferences and the concept of contrapositive in logic. The original statement is a conditional statement, often called \"if-then\" statement. It can be symbolized as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue\". \n\nThe contrapositive of this statement switches the hypothesis and the conclusion and negates both. So, the contrapositive is \"If not Q, then not P\", which in this case is \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\".\n\nHowever, the question asks about the inference \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\". This is not the contrapositive of the original statement, but it is actually equivalent to it. \n\nThis is because in logical systems where the statements are either true or false (like our everyday world), the statements \"If P, then Q\" and \"If not Q, then not P\" are equivalent. This is known as the principle of transposition in logic.\n\nTherefore, from \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\", we can infer \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
