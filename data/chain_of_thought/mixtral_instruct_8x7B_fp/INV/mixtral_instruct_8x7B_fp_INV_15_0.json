The original statement is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\" This is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the statement we are asked to infer is \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\" This is not the contrapositive, but it is still logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we can infer the desired statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
