            "content": "Explanation: This question is asking about the logical concept of contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. In this case, P is 'Ben ate pasta' and Q is 'Kate ate salad'. The contrapositive of 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad' is indeed 'If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad'. Since the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can infer 'If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad' from 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
