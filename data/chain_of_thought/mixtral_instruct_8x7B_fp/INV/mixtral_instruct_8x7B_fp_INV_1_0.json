            "content": "Explanation: This statement is an example of a logical construct known as a contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. In this case, 'Mary was at the wedding' is P and 'Sue was at the wedding' is Q. The given statement is 'If P, then Q'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If not Q, then not P', which translates to 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding'. However, the statement we are asked to infer is 'If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding', which is the converse of the original statement, not the contrapositive. The converse of a statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If Q, then P'. The converse and contrapositive are not logically equivalent, meaning that they do not have the same truth value. Therefore, we cannot infer the desired statement from the given statement.\nAnswer: No."
