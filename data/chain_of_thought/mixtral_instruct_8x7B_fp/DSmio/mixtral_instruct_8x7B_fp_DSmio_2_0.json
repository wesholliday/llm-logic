Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\n\nThe first statement tells us that it's possible for the book not to be on the table, which means that the book could potentially be somewhere else. The second statement presents us with two possibilities: either the book is on the shelf or it is on the table.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the book might not be on the table, this implies that the book must be on the shelf in this case. Therefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that 'The book is on the shelf'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
