The first statement tells us that the notebook may not be on the nightstand, implying it could be somewhere else or even in the drawer. The second statement gives us two possibilities for the location of the notebook: in the drawer or on the nightstand.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the notebook might not be on the nightstand, it's possible that the notebook is actually in the drawer. The information provided does not contradict this possibility. Therefore, based on these statements, we can infer that the notebook could be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
