This statement implies that the cat could be somewhere else and not necessarily in the bedroom.\n2. Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom. This statement presents two possibilities for the cat's location.\n\nGiven these statements, we cannot infer that 'The cat is napping on the couch'. This is because the first statement tells us that the cat might not be in the bedroom, but it doesn't confirm that the cat is on the couch. The second statement gives us two options, one of which is the couch, but it doesn't exclude the possibility of the cat playing in the bedroom. Therefore, based on the provided information, we cannot definitively say where the cat is.\n\nAnswer: No."
