Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\n\nThe first statement implies that the remote control could be anywhere, not just under the couch. The second statement presents two possibilities for the remote control's location: on the coffee table or under the couch.\n\nGiven these statements, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The remote control is on the coffee table'. While this is one of the possibilities, we cannot rule out the possibility that the remote control is somewhere else, such as on a chair or a bed.\n\nAnswer: No."
