The first statement tells us that it's possible that the sunglasses are not on her head, but it doesn't rule out the possibility of them being in her bag. The second statement gives us two options: either the sunglasses are in her bag or they're perched on her head.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head, this leaves us with only one option from the second statement, which is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
