Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\n\nThe first statement implies that the watch could be somewhere other than his wrist. The second statement presents two possibilities for the location of the watch: charging on the dresser or on his wrist. Since we know from the first statement that the watch might not be on his wrist, it follows that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
