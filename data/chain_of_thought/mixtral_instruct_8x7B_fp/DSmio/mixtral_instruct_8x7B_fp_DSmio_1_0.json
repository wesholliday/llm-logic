In this case, the first part states that Fido could be inside, and the second part is the negation of the first part of our original statement, which we've already determined could be false.\n\nTogether, these statements tell us that Fido could be inside, and Fido cannot be outside in the garden unless Fido is not inside. Since it's possible that Fido is not in the garden, it's also possible that Fido is inside. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that 'Fido is inside' based on these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: No."
