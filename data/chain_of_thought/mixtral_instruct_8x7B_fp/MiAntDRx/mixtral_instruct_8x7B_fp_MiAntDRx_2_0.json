The quibble might be on the quibble\n2. The quibble might be in the fizzle\n\nThe phrase \"on the quibble\" suggests that the issue (quibble) is related to the quibble itself, perhaps referring to a problem with the definition or interpretation of the word \"quibble\". \n\nOn the other hand, the phrase \"in the fizzle\" suggests that the problem (quibble) is located within the fizzle. Here, \"fizzle\" is a noun and its meaning is not explicitly clear from the sentence, but it implies some context that is separate from the quibble.\n\nGiven that the statement presents both scenarios as possibilities, we can indeed infer that \"The quibble might be in the fizzle\" is a valid interpretation based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
