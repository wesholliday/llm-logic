The word 'or' in this context indicates that either of these possibilities could be the case, but not necessarily both.\n\nHowever, the statement does not exclude the possibility that the fribble might be on the wumble. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot rule out the possibility that the fribble might be on the wumble.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
