The bimboozle might be snorkel by grazzle\n2. The bimboozle might be blimp\n\nThe first possibility suggests that the bimboozle is associated with a snorkel, which in turn is associated with a grazzle. However, this does not exclude the second possibility that the bimboozle might be directly associated with a blimp. Therefore, based on the given statement, we can infer that 'The bimboozle might be blimp' is a valid possibility.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
