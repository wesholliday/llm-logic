The word \"or\" separates different possibilities. In this case, \"zazzle zizz zibber\" and \"blurble\" are two separate possibilities for what \"the zibber\" might be. Therefore, we can infer that \"The zibber might be blurble\" is one of the possibilities stated in the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
