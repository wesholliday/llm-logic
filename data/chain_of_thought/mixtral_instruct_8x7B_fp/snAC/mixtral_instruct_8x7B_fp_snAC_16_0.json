This is represented as:\n\nshirt = cotton -> pants = denim\n\nWe are given that the pants are denim, so:\n\npants = denim\n\nTo determine if the shirt is necessarily cotton, we need to see if the condition that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim, holds true. That is, we need to check if:\n\nshirt = cotton\n\nHowever, the given information does not specify whether or not the shirt is cotton. It only states that the pants are denim. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that the shirt is cotton based on the provided information.\n\nAnswer: No."
