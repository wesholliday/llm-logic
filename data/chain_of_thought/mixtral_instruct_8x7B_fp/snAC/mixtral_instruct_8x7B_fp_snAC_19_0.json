            "content": "Explanation: This is a conditional statement where the truth of one event (Tom watching football) is dependent on another event (Jen watching basketball). This type of conditional statement is also known as a material implication. \n\nIn English, the statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' means that Jen's watching basketball is a necessary condition for Tom's watching football. \n\nGiven that 'Jen watched basketball' is true, we need to check if this condition is met. If it is, then we can conclude that 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' implies that 'Tom watched football'. \n\nHowever, if 'Jen watched basketball' were not true, then the truth of 'Tom watched football' could not be determined from this conditional statement alone. \n\nAnswer: Yes, because in this case, the condition of 'Jen watched basketball' is met, so we can conclude that 'Tom watched football'."
