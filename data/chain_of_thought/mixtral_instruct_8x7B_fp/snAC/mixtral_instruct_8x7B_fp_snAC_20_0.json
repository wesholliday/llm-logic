Given that the second part of this statement, 'The banana was yellow', is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that the first part, 'The apple was red', is true. It's possible that the banana could be yellow for reasons other than the apple being red. However, in the context of this specific conditional statement, having 'The banana was yellow' as true does support the truth of 'The apple was red'. This is because, according to the given conditional statement, every time the apple is red, the banana is yellow. So, if 'The banana was yellow' is true, it could still be consistent with the conditional statement that 'The apple was red'. But without further information, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The apple was red' is true.\n\nAnswer: No."
