To determine if Ben ate pasta, we need to consider the possible scenarios. If Kate ate salad, then there are two possibilities: Ben ate pasta or Ben did not eat pasta. However, since the conditional statement 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad' is true, and we know that Kate did indeed eat salad, it must be the case that Ben ate pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
