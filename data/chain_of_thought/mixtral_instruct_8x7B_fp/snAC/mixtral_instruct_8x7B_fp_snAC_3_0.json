            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical implication. We are given the conditional statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" and told that the book is a mystery novel. To determine if it necessarily follows that the book was written by James, we can use a logical argument called modus ponens. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, then we can infer that Q is true. However, in this case, we are not trying to infer that the book is a mystery novel (Q), but rather that the book was written by James (P). To do this, we would need to use the contrapositive of the original conditional statement, which states \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\" Since we know that the book is a mystery novel, the contrapositive does not allow us to infer that the book was written by James. Therefore, it does not necessarily follow that the book was written by James. Answer: No"
