            "content": "Explanation: This is a conditional statement: 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'. According to this statement, if the condition (the doll being plastic) is true, then the consequence (the truck being metal) must also be true. \n\nHowever, the statement does not work in both directions. If the consequence is true, it doesn't necessarily mean the condition is true. This is known as a one-way conditional or material implication.\n\nIn this case, we know that 'The truck was metal' is true. But the truth of this statement doesn't require the doll to be plastic. The doll could be made of any material or there might not even be a doll at all. The only requirement is that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal.\n\nAnswer: No."
