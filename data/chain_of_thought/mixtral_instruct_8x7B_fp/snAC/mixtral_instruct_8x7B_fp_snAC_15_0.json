This is represented as P -> T.\n2. Erin took a train (T) is true.\n\nThe question asks if Sam took a plane (P) is necessarily true under these conditions. To determine this, we can use a truth table or apply logical reasoning.\n\nIn this case, since Erin took a train (T) is true, and the first statement tells us that if Sam took a plane (P), then Erin took a train (T), it follows that Sam must have taken a plane (P) to make the conditional statement true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
