We are given that the mummy was awake and that the statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is true. From this information, we cannot directly conclude that the vampire was awake. However, we can say that the vampire could have been awake. The reason being, the given statement only assures us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would be awake. It does not guarantee that the vampire's wakefulness is the only condition for the mummy's wakefulness. The mummy could have woken up due to some other reasons as well. But since we are not given any information to rule out the possibility of the vampire's wakefulness, we cannot definitively say that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: No."
