In this case, we use Modus Ponens, which states that if the hypothesis is true and the conditional statement is also true, then the conclusion must be true.\n\nHere, the hypothesis 'If Sue chose pizza' is consistent with the given information, and the conditional statement 'then Bob chose pasta' is also true because it is given. Therefore, the conclusion 'Sue chose pizza' must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
