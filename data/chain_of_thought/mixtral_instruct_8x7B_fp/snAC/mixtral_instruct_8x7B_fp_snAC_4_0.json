Given that this implication is true, and the individual statement 'The robot visited Jupiter' is also true, then it does logically follow that 'The alien visited Mars' must be true as well. This is because, in a true implication, if the hypothesis is true, then the conclusion must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
