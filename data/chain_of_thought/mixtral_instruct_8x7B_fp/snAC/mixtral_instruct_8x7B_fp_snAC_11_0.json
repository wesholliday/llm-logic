The statement 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' means that the muffins being blueberry is dependent on the cake being chocolate. \n\nHowever, the truth of the second statement, 'The muffins were blueberry', does not necessarily mean that the first condition is true. It could be the case that the muffins were blueberry for some other reason, not because the cake was chocolate. \n\nIn logical terms, the statement 'The muffins were blueberry' does not guarantee or necessitate the truth of 'The cake was chocolate'. This is an example of the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nAnswer: No."
