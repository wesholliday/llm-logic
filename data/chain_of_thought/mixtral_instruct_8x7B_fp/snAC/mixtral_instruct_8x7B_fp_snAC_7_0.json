            "content": "Explanation: This is a conditional statement where if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This is represented as: Alex -> Chris. We are given that this statement is true. We are also given that the statement 'Chris finished the race' is true. To determine if 'Alex finished the race' is necessarily true, we need to consider the possible truth values of the statements according to the given information. If Alex didn't finish the race (Alex = false), then the conditional statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' would still be true, because if Alex didn't finish, it doesn't necessarily mean Chris didn't either. However, if Chris finished the race (Chris = true), then the conditional statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' doesn't give us enough information to determine if Alex finished the race or not. In this case, Alex could have finished the race, or Alex could have not finished the race. But since we are given that 'Chris finished the race' is true, it is possible that Alex finished the race as well, because the truth of 'Chris finished the race' doesn't contradict the truth of the conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes, it is possible that 'Alex finished the race' is true."
