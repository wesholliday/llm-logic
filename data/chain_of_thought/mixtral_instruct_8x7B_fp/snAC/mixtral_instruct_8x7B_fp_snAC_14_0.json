The transitive property states that if A implies B and B implies C, then A implies C. \n\nHowever, the given statement 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den' is a conditional statement, also known as an 'if-then' statement. It does not necessarily mean that the presence of the bear in the cave and the wolf in the den are directly related, only that one follows the other.\n\nGiven the second statement that 'The wolf was in the den', we cannot be certain if the condition for the first statement (the bear being in the cave) was met. \n\nAnswer: No."
