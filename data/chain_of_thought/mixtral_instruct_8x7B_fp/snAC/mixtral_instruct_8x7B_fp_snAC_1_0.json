The statement 'Sue was at the wedding' is given as true, which is the consequent q in our conditional statement. To determine if Mary was at the wedding, we need to consider the possibility that Mary could have not been at the wedding, which would make the antecedent p false. However, in the given information, there is no statement or condition that contradicts the possibility of Mary being at the wedding. Therefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that Mary was likely at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
