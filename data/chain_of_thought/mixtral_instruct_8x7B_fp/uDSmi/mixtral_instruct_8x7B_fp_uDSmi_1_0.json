However, the statement \"Fido might not be in the garden\" introduces a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. This does not necessarily mean that Fido is inside, as there may be other possible locations where Fido could be. Therefore, we cannot infer that Fido is inside based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No."
