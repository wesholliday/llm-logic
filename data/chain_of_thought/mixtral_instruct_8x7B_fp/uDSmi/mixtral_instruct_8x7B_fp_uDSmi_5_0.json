However, the statement \"the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" does not exclude the possibility that the cookies are in the jar. It only tells us that we can't be certain the cookies are hidden in the pantry. It doesn't give us any information about whether the cookies are in the jar or not. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: No."
