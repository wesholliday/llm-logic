However, the statement \"the jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" does not contradict the previous disjunction; instead, it emphasizes the uncertainty of the jacket's location in the closet. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: No."
