However, it also introduces a third possibility - the watch might not be on his wrist. This third possibility leaves open the chance that the watch is not being worn, but it doesn't confirm where the watch is. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: No."
