However, the statement \"the notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" does not contradict the first statement because it's already acknowledged as a possibility in the initial disjunction. This second statement simply reiterates that the notebook is not necessarily on the nightstand. Since the notebook could be in the drawer regardless of whether it's on the nightstand or not, we cannot infer from these statements that the notebook is definitively in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: No."
