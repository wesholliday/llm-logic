However, the statement \"the umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet\" does not rule out the possibility that the umbrella is in the car. It only tells us that the umbrella is not necessarily in the closet. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: No."
