However, the second clause, \"lead to a Nobel Prize,\" is not in contradiction with the first clause, \"The discovery might be accidental.\" Therefore, it is possible for the discovery to be accidental, even if the statement also mentions the possibility of it leading to a Nobel Prize.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
