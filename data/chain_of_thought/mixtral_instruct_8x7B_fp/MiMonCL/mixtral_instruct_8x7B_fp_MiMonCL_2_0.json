            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The concert might be sold out and feature a famous band\" contains two clauses joined by the conjunction \"and\". The first clause is \"The concert might be sold out\". The conjunction \"and\" connects two independent clauses, which means that each clause can be a separate statement on its own. Therefore, the first clause \"The concert might be sold out\" can be considered independently from the second clause \"feature a famous band\". Since the first clause is not dependent on the second one, we can infer that the possibility of the concert being sold out can be inferred from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
