The phrase \"might be injured\" is the main condition here, and the inability to compete is a consequence of that condition. Therefore, if the athlete might be injured, then it is indeed possible that the athlete might be injured, regardless of whether the second part about not being able to compete is true or not.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
