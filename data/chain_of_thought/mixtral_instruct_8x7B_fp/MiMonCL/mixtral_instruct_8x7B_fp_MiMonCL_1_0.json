A conjunction is a logical operator that combines two or more statements, forming a new statement that is true if and only if all the original statements are true. In this case, the statement \"The flibbit might be zorped\" is one of the two statements being conjoined. Therefore, if the overall statement is true, then it must be the case that \"The flibbit might be zorped\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
