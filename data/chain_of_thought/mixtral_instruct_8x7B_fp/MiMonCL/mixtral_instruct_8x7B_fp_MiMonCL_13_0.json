The original statement is made up of two clauses joined by the word 'and'. The second clause 'affect travel plans' is a consequence of the first clause 'The weather might be unpredictable'. Therefore, the first clause can be inferred as true even if the second clause is not explicitly stated to be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
