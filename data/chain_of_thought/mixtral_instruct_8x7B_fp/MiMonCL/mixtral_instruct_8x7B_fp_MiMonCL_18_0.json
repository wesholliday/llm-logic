This implies that there are other possible scenarios where the performance may not be improvised. However, even if the performance is not improvised in other scenarios, it is still possible that it could be improvised in this particular scenario. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the performance will be improvised, but we can infer that it might be improvised.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
