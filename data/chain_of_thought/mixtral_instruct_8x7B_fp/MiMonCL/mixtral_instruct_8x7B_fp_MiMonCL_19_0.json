The first clause is \"The election might be close\". The second clause is \"require a recount\". \n\nWhen a conjunction connects two clauses like this, it often implies that both clauses are true or could be true at the same time. In this case, the use of \"and\" suggests that if the election might require a recount, then it must also be close. \n\nTherefore, yes, from \"The election might be close and require a recount\", we can infer \"The election might be close\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
