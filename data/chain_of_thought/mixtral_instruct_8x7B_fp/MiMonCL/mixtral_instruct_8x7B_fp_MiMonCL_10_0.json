            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The project might be delayed and require additional funding\" is a compound statement, meaning it contains two separate clauses joined by the conjunction \"and\". The second clause is \"require additional funding\". If we focus on the first clause, \"The project might be delayed\", we can see that this is a standalone idea and the truth of this clause does not depend on the second clause. Therefore, even if we remove the second clause, the first clause still maintains its original meaning. Hence, from \"The project might be delayed and require additional funding\", we can infer \"The project might be delayed\".\n\nAnswer: Yes"
