            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The investment might be risky and offer high returns' contains two clauses: 'The investment might be risky' and 'offer high returns'. These two clauses are connected by the conjunction 'and'. In logic, 'and' represents conjunction, which means both conditions must be true for the whole statement to be true. However, the presence of 'and' does not imply that the two clauses are equivalent or dependent on each other. In this case, even though the second clause 'offer high returns' is mentioned, it does not affect the truth of the first clause 'The investment might be risky'. Therefore, we can infer 'The investment might be risky' from the original statement.\nAnswer: Yes."
