Disjunctive syllogism states that if you have an argument in the form \"Either P or Q, not P, therefore Q\", it is a valid argument.\n\nIn this case, the statement \"Either the remote control is hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table\" is the disjunction (either/or statement). The subsequent statement \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch\" negates the first part of the disjunction.\n\nTherefore, based on the rules of disjunctive syllogism, we can indeed infer that \"The remote control is on the coffee table\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
