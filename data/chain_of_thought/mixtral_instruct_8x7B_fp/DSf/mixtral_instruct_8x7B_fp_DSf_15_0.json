            "content": "Explanation: This is an application of the rule of inference called Disjunctive Syllogism. A Disjunctive Statement is a statement that has two parts connected by 'or'. A Disjunctive Syllogism is a valid argument that applies when one part of the disjunctive statement is known to be false, allowing us to infer that the other part must be true.\n\nIn this case, the disjunctive statement is 'the shoes are lined up by the door or they are in the closet'. We are given that the first part, 'the shoes are lined up by the door', is false. Therefore, based on the rule of Disjunctive Syllogism, we can infer that the second part, 'the shoes are in the closet', must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
