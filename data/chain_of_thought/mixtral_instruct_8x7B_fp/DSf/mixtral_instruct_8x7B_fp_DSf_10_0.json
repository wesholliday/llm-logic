            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'Either the missing sock is under the bed or it's in the laundry basket' is a logical disjunction, meaning that one or the other statement can be true. If we then learn that 'The missing sock isn't under the bed', this eliminates one of the possibilities presented in the original statement. In logic, when we eliminate all possibilities except for one, the remaining possibility must be true. Therefore, if the missing sock is not under the bed, then it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
