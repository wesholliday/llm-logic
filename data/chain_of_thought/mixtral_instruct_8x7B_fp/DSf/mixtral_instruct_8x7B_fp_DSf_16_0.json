The original statement is \"Either the pen is on my desk or it is in my bag\". If we negate the first part, \"The pen is not on my desk\", this means that the pen cannot be on the desk. Given that the original statement only provides two possible locations for the pen, and we have now ruled out one, it follows that the pen must be in the remaining location.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
