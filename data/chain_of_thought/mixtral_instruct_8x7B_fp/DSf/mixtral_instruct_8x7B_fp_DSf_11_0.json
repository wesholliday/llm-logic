            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'Either the newspaper is sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway' is a logical disjunction, meaning that one (or more) of the two statements must be true. In this case, the two statements are 'The newspaper is sitting on the porch' and 'The newspaper is in the driveway'. \n\nThe second statement we're given is 'The newspaper isn't sitting on the porch'. This negates the first possible location for the newspaper. \n\nSince the logical disjunction tells us that the newspaper must be in one of these two locations, and we now know it's not on the porch, it follows logically that the newspaper must be in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
