(P or Q)\n\nAnd then we are given the additional information:\nThe cat isn't playing in the bedroom. (Not P)\n\nWith this new information, we can infer that the cat must be napping on the couch. \n\nThis is because if the cat is not doing the first activity (playing in the bedroom), and the initial statement was a disjunction (either/or), then the only option left is that the cat is doing the second activity (napping on the couch).\n\nAnswer: Yes."
