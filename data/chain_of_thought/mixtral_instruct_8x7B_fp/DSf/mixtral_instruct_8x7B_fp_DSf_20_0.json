            "content": "Explanation: This is a logical reasoning question that involves disjunctive syllogism, a form of argument in classical logic. The statement \"Either the sunglasses are perched on her head or they are in her bag\" is a disjunction, meaning it is a statement formed by joining two simpler statements with \"or.\" The second statement, \"The sunglasses aren't perched on her head,\" negates the first part of the disjunction. In disjunctive syllogism, if one of the disjuncts is false, then the other must be true. Therefore, since the sunglasses are not perched on her head, it follows that they must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
