We know that the cookies are either in the pantry or in the jar, and we are told that they are not in the pantry. However, just because they are not in the pantry does not necessarily mean they are in the jar. There could be other possible locations where the cookies might be. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the cookies are in the jar based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No."
