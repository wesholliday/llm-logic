Given the first statement \"Either the notebook is sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer\", we know that the notebook can only be in one of two places: on the nightstand or in the drawer.  The second statement \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand\" negates one of the possibilities in the first statement, leaving us with only one option: that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
