The argument can be broken down as follows:\n\nP1: If Mary was at the wedding (M), then Sue was at the wedding (S).\nP2: Mary was at the wedding (M).\n\nFrom these two premises, we can infer that Sue was at the wedding (S). This is a valid form of argument because if the first premise (the conditional statement) is true, and the second premise (the antecedent) is also true, then the conclusion (the consequent) must be true as well.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
