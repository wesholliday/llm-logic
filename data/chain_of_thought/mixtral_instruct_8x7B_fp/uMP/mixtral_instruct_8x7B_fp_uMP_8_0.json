The second part states that \"the vampire was awake\". This is a fact or an actual situation. \n\nGiven the first condition, if the vampire was awake, then it is inferred that the mummy was awake. Since the second part of the statement confirms that the vampire was indeed awake, it follows that the mummy must have been awake as well, based on the condition stated.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
