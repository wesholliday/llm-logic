The first statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This is a conditional statement, also known as a logical if-then rule. The second statement is \"the apple was red.\"\n\nTo determine if the banana was yellow, we need to apply the logical if-then rule from the first statement to the second statement. \n\nGiven the second statement \"the apple was red,\" and applying it to the logical if-then rule in the first statement, we can infer that since the apple was red, then as a result, the banana should be yellow.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
