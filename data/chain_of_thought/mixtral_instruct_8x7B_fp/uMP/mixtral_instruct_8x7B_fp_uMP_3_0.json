This is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. The second statement is \"the book was written by James\". \n\nTo determine if the book is a mystery novel, we need to apply the second statement to the first. According to the first statement, if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. The second statement tells us that the book was indeed written by James. Therefore, we can apply the second statement to the first and infer that the book is a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
