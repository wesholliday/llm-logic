The first one is \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This is a conditional statement, also known as a hypothetical or \"if-then\" statement. It means that if the condition (the car being red) is true, then the consequence (the truck being blue) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement is \"the car was red.\" According to our first statement, if the car is red, then the truck should be blue.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
