The bear was in the cave.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can't conclude that the wolf is definitely in the den because it's a conditional statement - it only tells us that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf is in the den, but it doesn't say anything about what happens when the bear is actually in the cave.\n\nHowever, the second statement tells us that the bear was indeed in the cave. Given this new information, we can now go back to our conditional statement and apply what we know: the bear was in the cave. Therefore, based on the condition laid out, it must be true that the wolf was in the den.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
