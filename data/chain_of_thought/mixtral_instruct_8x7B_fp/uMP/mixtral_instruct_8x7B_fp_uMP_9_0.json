Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the result (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true. The second statement confirms that Lisa did indeed buy the red shirt.\n\nSince the condition in the first statement is true (Lisa buying the red shirt), it follows that the result must also be true (Mark buying the blue shirt).\n\nAnswer: Yes."
