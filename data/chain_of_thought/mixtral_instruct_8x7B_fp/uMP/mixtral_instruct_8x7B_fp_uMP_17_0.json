We know that \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This is a conditional statement, often referred to as \"if p, then q.\"\n2. We are also told that \"Ben ate pasta.\" This is just the condition part (p) of our conditional statement being true.\n3. Therefore, based on our conditional statement, because the condition is true, it follows that Kate ate salad (q).\n\nAnswer: Yes."
