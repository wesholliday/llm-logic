Based on this information, we can apply logical reasoning to determine Bob's choice.\n\nThe first piece of information is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This is also known as a material implication, where the truth of the statement depends on the combination of its hypothesis (Sue chose pizza) and conclusion (Bob chose pasta).\n\nThe second piece of information tells us that Sue actually did choose pizza. Given the conditional statement from the first piece of information, we can now conclude that Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
