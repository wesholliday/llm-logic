We're given the statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement. The part before the \"then\" (in this case, \"If Alex finished the race\") is called the hypothesis, and the part after the \"then\" (in this case, \"Chris finished the race\") is called the conclusion.\n\n2. We're also given that \"Alex finished the race.\"\n\n3. Given that the hypothesis in our conditional statement is true (that Alex finished the race), it would follow that the conclusion must also be true (that Chris finished the race).\n\nAnswer: Yes."
