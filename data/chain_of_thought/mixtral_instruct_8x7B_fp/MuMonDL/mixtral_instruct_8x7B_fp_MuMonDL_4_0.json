The statement \"The meeting must have been scheduled for 2 PM or been rescheduled\" introduces an additional possibility, that the meeting could have been scheduled for a different time and then changed to 2 PM. Without specific information suggesting that the meeting was rescheduled, we cannot infer from the original statement that this was the case. Therefore, the answer is no."
