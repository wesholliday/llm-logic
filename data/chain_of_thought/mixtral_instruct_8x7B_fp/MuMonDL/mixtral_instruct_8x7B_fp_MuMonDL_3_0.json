It does not rule out the possibility that the keys could be somewhere else, such as on the table. However, simply because the first statement is true does not necessarily mean that the second statement (which includes an additional possibility) must also be true. We would need additional information to confirm that the keys are not on the table or in some other location. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The keys must be in the drawer or on the table\" based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No."
