            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The book must be on the shelf\" implies that the book is located in a specific place, which is the shelf. The statement 'The book must be on the shelf or in the library' suggests that the book can be in one of two places: on the shelf or in the library. Since the original statement only specifies that the book must be on the shelf and does not exclude the possibility that it could also be in the library, it is not possible to infer from the original statement that the book can be in the library. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: No."
