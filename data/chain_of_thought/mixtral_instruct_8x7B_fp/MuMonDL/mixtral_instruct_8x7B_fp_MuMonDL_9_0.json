            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The flight must have been delayed' implies that there was some disruption in the normal schedule of the flight, but it does not explicitly state that the flight was rescheduled. Rescheduling is a possible action when a flight is delayed, but it is not the only possibility. The flight could have been delayed without being rescheduled, for example, if it was delayed but still operated on the same day and at the same destination. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The flight must have been delayed or rescheduled' based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
