            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday\" implies that the project should be completed strictly before or by Friday. It does not include any possibility of completion after Friday. Therefore, the extended statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday or next week\" is a contradiction to the original statement. This is because the 'or next week' part allows for the possibility of completion after Friday, which is not allowed in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
