            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays\" implies that the restaurant was not open at all on Mondays. The statement \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays or had limited hours\" suggests that either the restaurant was not open at all on Mondays, or it was open but with limited hours. Since the first statement already includes the idea of the restaurant being completely closed on Mondays, it does not add any new information to infer that the restaurant might have had limited hours on Mondays. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays or had limited hours\" from \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays\".\n\nAnswer: No."
