The suggested statement \"The envelope must be under a bed or upstairs\" includes the original information that the envelope is under a bed, but also adds the possibility that the envelope is upstairs. Since the original statement does not provide any information about the location of the envelope being upstairs, we cannot infer that the envelope is also possibly upstairs based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
