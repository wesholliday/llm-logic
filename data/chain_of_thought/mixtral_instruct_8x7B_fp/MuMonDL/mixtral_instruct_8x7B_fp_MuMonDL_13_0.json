However, it doesn't explicitly rule out the possibility of the movie having English subtitles for a foreign language film. The statement is only addressing the language of the movie, not the presence or absence of subtitles. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the movie must have had English subtitles.\n\nAnswer: No."
