'Black-tie' is a more specific and stricter dress code category that falls under the formal dress code category. Therefore, if we infer 'The event must have been formal or black-tie' from 'The event must have been formal', we are making an assumption that goes beyond what has been explicitly stated.\n\nAnswer: No."
