The proposed statement \"The room must have been cleaned daily or as requested\" includes the original possibility (daily) as well as an additional possibility (as requested). Therefore, the proposed statement is not logically implied by the original statement, because it includes a possibility that is not part of the original statement. However, the proposed statement is a logical consequence of the original statement, because the original statement allows for only one possibility, and the proposed statement adds an additional possibility that does not contradict the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
