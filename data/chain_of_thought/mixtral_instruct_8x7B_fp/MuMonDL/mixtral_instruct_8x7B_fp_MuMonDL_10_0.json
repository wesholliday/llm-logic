The concept of approval is often associated with signing, but it is not explicitly stated in the given statement. Approval can be inferred if we understand that signing a document typically means that the person who signed it has reviewed and agreed to its contents. However, it's important to note that there could be other reasons for signing a document, such as authentication or verification, which may not necessarily involve approval. Therefore, while approval can be inferred in many cases, it cannot be definitively concluded based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No."
