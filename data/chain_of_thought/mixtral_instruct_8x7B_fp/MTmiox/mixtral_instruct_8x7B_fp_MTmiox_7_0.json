This statement doesn't give us any information about whether the whiffle was shanked or not.\n\n2. \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked\" is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the whiffle was shanked, then it definitely tinked. However, it doesn't tell us whether the whiffle was actually shanked or not.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we cannot infer that \"The whiffle was not shanked\". The first statement does not provide enough information about the shanking of the whiffle, and the second statement only tells us about the relationship between shanking and tinking, not whether either of these events occurred.\n\nAnswer: No."
