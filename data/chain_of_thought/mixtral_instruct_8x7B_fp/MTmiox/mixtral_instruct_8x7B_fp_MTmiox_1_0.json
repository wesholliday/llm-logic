This statement implies that there is a possibility that the flugel was not zargled. It does not rule out the possibility that the flugel could have been blimmed instead.\n\n2. If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled. This statement means that if the flugel underwent the process of being blimmed, then it is necessarily true that the flugel was zargled.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not state that the flugel cannot be blimmed without being zargled first. Therefore, even though the first statement tells us that the flugel might not have been zargled, it does not necessarily mean that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: No."
