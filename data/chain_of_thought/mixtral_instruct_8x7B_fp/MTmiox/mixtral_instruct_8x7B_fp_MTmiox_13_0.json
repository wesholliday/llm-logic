It tells us that if the glip was slogged, then it is necessary that it also tragged.\n\nHowever, the given statements do not provide any direct information about whether the glip was slogged or not. The second statement only tells us what would be true if the glip was slogged, but it doesn't tell us whether it was actually slogged.\n\nWithout further information, we cannot definitively say that 'The glip was not slogged'. We can only say that if the glip was not slogged, then it might not have tragged.\n\nAnswer: No."
