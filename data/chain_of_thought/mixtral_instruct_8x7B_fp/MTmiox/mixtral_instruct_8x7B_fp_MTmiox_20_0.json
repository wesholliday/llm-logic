It doesn't rule out the possibility that it could have been bluttered.\n\n2. \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned\" is a conditional statement which means that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it is necessary that it was surned. However, this doesn't mean that if the fleeg was not bluttered, it couldn't have been surned.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot infer that 'The fleeg was not bluttered' because the first statement leaves open the possibility that the fleeg could have been bluttered. The second statement only tells us what happens when the fleeg is bluttered, not when it isn't.\n\nAnswer: No."
