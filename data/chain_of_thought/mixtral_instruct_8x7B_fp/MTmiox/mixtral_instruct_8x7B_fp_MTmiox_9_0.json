The twonk might not have been varnished: This statement implies that there is a possibility that the twonk was not varnished, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that it could have been varnished.\n\n2. If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished: This statement means that if the twonk underwent the action of being plinked, then it is a necessary condition that it was varnished before.\n\nNow, let's consider whether we can infer 'The twonk was not plinked' based on these statements.\n\nThe first statement does not provide enough information about whether the twonk was plinked or not. The second statement tells us that if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished. However, it does not necessarily mean that if the twonk was not varnished, then it couldn't have been plinked. There could be cases where the twonk was plinked even if it wasn't varnished.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The twonk was not plinked'.\n\nAnswer: No."
