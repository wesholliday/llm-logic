This statement implies that there is a possibility that the clug was not in a snugged state. It does not rule out the possibility that the clug could have been snugged.\n\n2. \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged\". This statement is a conditional statement, meaning if the condition (the clug being fleeked) is true, then the result (the clug being snugged) must also be true.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot infer that 'The clug was not fleeked'. The fact that there's a possibility that the clug was not snugged does not necessarily mean it wasn't fleeked. The two statements operate independently of each other. \n\nAnswer: No."
