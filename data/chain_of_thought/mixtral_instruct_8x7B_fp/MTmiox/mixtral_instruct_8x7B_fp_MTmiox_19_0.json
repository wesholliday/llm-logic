If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged. This statement means that if the smonk was in the vreebled state, then plagging is a necessary consequence.\n\nThe conclusion we are asked to consider is 'The smonk was not vreebled'. To reach this conclusion, we would need to show that the smonk's vreebledness is incompatible with the possibility that the smonk did not plag. However, the given information does not allow us to make this connection. It's possible that the smonk was not vreebled and also did not plag, or that the smonk was vreebled and did plag. We don't have enough information to rule out either possibility.\n\nAnswer: No."
