The first statement only tells us that there's a possibility the flob didn't move, but it doesn't rule out the possibility of the flob being skizzled. The second statement tells us about the implication of the flob being skizzled, but it doesn't say that the flob being skizzled is the only condition for the flob to move. Therefore, we cannot make a conclusion about the state of the flob being skizzled or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No."
