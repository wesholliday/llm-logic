This statement implies that there's a possibility that the sprocket was not daggled. It doesn't rule out the possibility that the sprocket was indeed daggled.\n\n2. If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled. This is a conditional statement, stating that if the first condition (the sprocket was cranked) is true, then the second condition (the sprocket was daggled) must also be true.\n\nThe question asks if we can infer 'The sprocket was not cranked'. To do this, we would need to find a connection between the sprocket being not daggled and the sprocket being not cranked.\n\nHowever, looking at the given statements, we cannot make such a connection. The first statement only tells us that there's a possibility that the sprocket was not daggled. It does not tell us anything about whether or not the sprocket was cranked. The second statement tells us that if the sprocket was cranked, then it was daggled. But it doesn't tell us what happens if the sprocket was not daggled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer 'The sprocket was not cranked'.\n\nAnswer: No."
