The first statement is \"The wug might not have bimmed the zoint\". This implies that it's possible that the wug did not perform the action of 'bimming' on the 'zoint'.\n2. The second statement is \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint\". This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the condition (the wug being flooped) is true, then the consequence (the wug bimming the zoint) must also be true.\n\nHowever, neither of these statements directly gives us information about whether or not the wug was flooped. The first statement tells us about the possibility of the wug bimming the zoint, and the second statement gives a condition for when the wug would have bimmed the zoint.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that \"The wug was not flooped\" based on the given statements."
