It doesn't rule out the possibility that the wug was garbled, but it also doesn't confirm it.\n\n2. \"If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garbled\" is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the wug was sproinged, then it had to be garbled. However, it doesn't tell us whether the wug was actually sproinged or not.\n\n3. From these two statements, we cannot directly infer that \"The wug was not sproinged\". The first statement only tells us that there's a possibility that the wug was not garbled, but it doesn't give any information about whether the wug was sproinged or not. The second statement tells us about the relationship between the wug being sproinged and garbled, but it doesn't tell us whether the wug was sproinged or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot make a definitive conclusion about whether \"The wug was not sproinged\".\n\nAnswer: No."
