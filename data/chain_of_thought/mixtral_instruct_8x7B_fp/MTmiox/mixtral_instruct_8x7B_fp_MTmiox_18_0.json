This statement implies that there is a possibility that the shank was not nugged. It does not rule out the possibility that the shank could have been nugged.\n\n2. If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged. This statement is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (the shank was plooked) is true, then the result (the shank must have been nugged) is also true.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot infer that 'The shank was not plooked'. The first statement only tells us that there's a possibility that the shank was not nugged. It doesn't give any information about whether the shank was plooked or not. The second statement tells us that if the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged. But it doesn't tell us that the shank was or was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: No."
