This statement implies that it's possible the splat did not quank, but it doesn't confirm it.\n\n2. If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked. This statement is a conditional statement, meaning if the condition (the splat being morphed) is true, then the result (the splat quanked) is also true.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot infer that 'The splat was not morphed'. The first statement only suggests the possibility of the splat not quanking, it doesn't deny the possibility of the splat being morphed. The second statement tells us that if the splat was morphed, it would have quanked, but it doesn't confirm whether the splat was actually morphed or not. Therefore, there is no definitive information to conclude that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: No."
