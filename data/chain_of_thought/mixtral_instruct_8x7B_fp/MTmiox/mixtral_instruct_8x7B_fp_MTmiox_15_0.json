The first statement is \"The dreb might not have been spended.\" This implies that there's a possibility that the dreb was not spent.\n\n2. The second statement is \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened.\" This is a conditional statement, meaning if the condition (the dreb was vroombed) is true, then the result (the dreb was spent) must also be true.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot directly infer that \"The dreb was not vroombed.\" The first statement only suggests that the dreb might not have been spent, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that it was vroombed and spent. The second statement tells us that if it was vroombed, then it was spent, but it doesn't say that it was definitely vroombed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot make a definitive conclusion about whether the dreb was or was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: No."
