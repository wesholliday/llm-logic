It does not exclude the possibility of other states for \"The frazzle\". However, the statement \"The frazzle must be crunk zump or flibbit floob\" is making an explicit statement that the only possible states for \"The frazzle\" are \"crunk zump\" and \"flibbit floob\".\n\nGiven that the original statement does not exclude the possibility of other states for \"The frazzle\", we cannot infer that \"The frazzle must be crunk zump or flibbit floob\" from \"The frazzle must be crunk zump\".\n\nAnswer: No."
