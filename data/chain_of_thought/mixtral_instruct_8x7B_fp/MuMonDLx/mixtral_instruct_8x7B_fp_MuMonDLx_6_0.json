It does not rule out or imply any other characteristics that the grooble may or may not have. Therefore, the statement \"The grooble must be plonk wobble or flonk wozzle bimboozle\" cannot be inferred from the original statement, as it makes a claim about the grooble having an additional characteristic that was not mentioned before.\n\nAnswer: No."
