The proposed new statement \"The quorple must be in quazzle or zizz zump wobble\" includes an additional option for the location of the quorple, the \"zizz zump wobble.\" However, the original statement does not provide any information about the quorple's potential location in the \"zizz zump wobble,\" so we cannot infer that it has this additional possible location based on the original statement alone. Answer: No."
