The statement \"The frazzle must be froodle or wobble\" suggests that the frazzle can be in one of two states: froodle or wobble. Since the original statement does not provide any information about the possibility of the frazzle being in a wobble state, we cannot infer that the frazzle can be wobble based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No."
