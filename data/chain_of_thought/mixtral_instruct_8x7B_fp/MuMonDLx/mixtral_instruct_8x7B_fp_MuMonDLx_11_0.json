The statement \"The fizzle must be wobble or shimble\" suggests that the fizzle has either the property of wobbling or the property of shimbling. Without further information, we cannot infer that the fizzle must have the ability to shimble as well. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that the first statement implies the second statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
