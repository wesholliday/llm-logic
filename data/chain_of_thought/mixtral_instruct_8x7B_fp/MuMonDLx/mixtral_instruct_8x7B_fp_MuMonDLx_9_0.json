The statement 'The zibble must be glorp or plonk', on the other hand, is a disjunctive statement that asserts the necessity of either one condition or another (or both).\n\nIn order to infer the latter statement from the former, we would need some additional information that connects the two conditions in a way that would allow us to make this inference. For example, if we knew that every zibble must be either a glorp or a plonk, then we could infer that if the zibble must be a glorp, it must also be either a glorp or a plonk.\n\nHowever, without this or some other similar connecting principle, we cannot validly infer the disjunctive statement from the categorical one. Therefore, we cannot say that the former statement implies the latter.\n\nAnswer: No."
