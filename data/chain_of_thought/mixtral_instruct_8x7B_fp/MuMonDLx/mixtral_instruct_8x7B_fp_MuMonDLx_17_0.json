The statement \"The blimple must be gribble or zizz\" would mean that the blimple is either a gribble or a zizz, but not necessarily one or the other. Since the first statement asserts that the blimple can only be a gribble, it does not support the conclusion that the blimple could also be a zizz. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The blimple must be gribble or zizz\" from \"The blimple must be gribble\".\n\nAnswer: No."
