The proposed statement \"The grazzle must be snork on zibble or wump wump wozzle\" is making a similar claim about what the grazzle must do on zibble, but also adding an additional requirement that the grazzle must do \"wump wump wozzle,\" which is not specified in the original statement. Therefore, the proposed statement is not logically implied by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
