The statement 'The wump must be on the plimp or in the quank' is making a disjunction, saying that the wump could either be on the plimp or in the quank. Without explicit information linking the wump, the plimp, and the quank, we cannot infer from the first statement that the wump must be on the plimp or in the quank. Answer: No."
