            "content": "Explanation: This question is a logical reasoning question that involves applying rules of inference.  Here, we are given a conditional statement, \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled,\" and a fact, \"The flugel was not zargled.\"  We want to determine if we can infer that \"The flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider the concept of logical contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"  The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nIn this case, the original statement is \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\"  The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\"  Since the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\nWe are also given the fact that \"The flugel was not zargled.\"  Since the contrapositive of the original statement is true, and we know that \"The flugel was not zargled,\" we can infer that \"The flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes."
