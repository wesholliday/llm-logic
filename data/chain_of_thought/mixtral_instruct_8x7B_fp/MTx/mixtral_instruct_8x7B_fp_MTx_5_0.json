It tells us that if one condition (the zinger being fraggled) is true, then another condition (the zinger being smoogled) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement 'The zinger was not smoogled' tells us that the consequence of our first statement is false.\n\nNow, we want to infer whether the zinger was fraggled or not. According to the given information, if the zinger was fraggled, then it would be smoogled. But we know that the zinger was not smoogled. Therefore, it couldn't have been the case that the zinger was fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
