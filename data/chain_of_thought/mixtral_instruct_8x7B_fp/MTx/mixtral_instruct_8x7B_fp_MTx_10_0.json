            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical reasoning problem, specifically it involves a concept called contrapositive. The original statement \"if the wug was sproinged, then it was garbled\" is in the form of \"if P, then Q\". The second statement \"the wug was not garbled\" is the negation of Q, or \"not Q\". The question asks if we can infer \"the wug was not sproinged\", or \"not P\". According to the rules of logic, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. The contrapositive of \"if P, then Q\" is \"if not Q, then not P\". Therefore, if the wug was not garbled, then it was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
