            "content": "Explanation: This question is a test of logical reasoning, specifically using the concept of contrapositive in formal logic. The original statement \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\" is in the form of an implication, where the hypothesis is \"the flob was skizzled\" and the conclusion is \"the flob movated.\" \n\nThe negation of the conclusion is \"the flob did not movate.\" The contrapositive of the original statement is created by negating the hypothesis and conclusion, then swapping their positions. So, the contrapositive of \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\" is \"If the flob did not movate, then the flob was not skizzled.\"\n\nSince the second statement provided is \"The flob did not movate,\" this matches the hypothesis of the contrapositive. Therefore, we can infer the conclusion of the contrapositive, which is \"The flob was not skizzled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes."
