            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical reasoning, specifically whether we can make a valid inference based on the given information.  The statement 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked' is an example of a conditional statement, often written as 'If P, then Q'. The second statement is 'The fribble did not crink', or 'not Q'. \n\nThe validity of the inference 'The fribble was not snurgled', or 'not P', depends on the logical relationship between these statements. In this case, the first statement is in the form of a conditional, and the second statement negates the conclusion of that conditional. \n\nThe logical principle at play here is called contrapositive reasoning. The contrapositive of a conditional 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. This is logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nTherefore, given 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked' and 'The fribble did not crink', we can infer 'The fribble was not snurgled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
