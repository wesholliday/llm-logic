            "content": "Explanation: This question is a logical reasoning question that involves evaluating a conditional statement and applying it to given circumstances. \n\nFirst, let's break down the given information. We have a conditional statement: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\" This can be represented as \"P -> Q,\" where P represents \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and Q represents \"it surned.\"\n\nWe are also given that \"The fleeg did not surn,\" which can be represented as \"not Q.\"\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered,\" which can be represented as \"not P.\"\n\nTo make this inference, we need to apply the concept of contrapositive reasoning. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"P -> Q\" is \"not Q -> not P.\" This means that if the consequence (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\nIn this case, since \"not Q\" is given, we can apply contrapositive reasoning to infer \"not P,\" or \"The fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes."
