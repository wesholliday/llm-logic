            "content": "Explanation: This question is testing logical reasoning and the concept of contrapositive in logic. The original statement \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\" is in the form of \"If P, then Q\". The second statement is \"The smonk did not plagged\", which is the negation of Q (Q' in logic notation). The statement we want to infer is \"The smonk was not vreebled\", which is the negation of P (P' in logic notation).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nIn this case, the original statement is \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\", so its contrapositive is \"If the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\".\n\nSince the second statement is \"The smonk did not plagged\", which is the negation of Q, we can infer the statement \"The smonk was not vreebled\" by applying the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
