            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical reasoning, specifically whether we can make a particular inference based on the given information. \n\nThe first statement \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. It tells us that if the sneg was crampled, then a certain consequence follows (the sneg sproted the frink). \n\nThe second statement \"The sneg did not sprotet the frink\" tells us that the consequence stated in the first statement did not occur.\n\nNow, the question asks whether we can infer that \"The sneg was not crampled\". This would be a logical fallacy known as denying the antecedent. The antecedent is the \"if\" part of the conditional statement, in this case, \"the sneg was crampled\". Denying the antecedent means concluding that the opposite of the antecedent must be true because the consequence is false. However, this is not logically valid. \n\nAnswer: No."
