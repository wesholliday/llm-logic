            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical reasoning and specifically about the concept of logical deduction. The given statements are:\n1. If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\n2. The grommet did not plop the frink\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer that the grommet was not sploffed. This is a classic example of a logical deduction using Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. The argument can be written in the form:\n\nIf P, then Q\nNot Q\n-----------------\nNot P\n\nHere, P represents \"the grommet was sploffed\" and Q represents \"the grommet plopped the frink\".\n\nThe first statement \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" can be written as \"If P, then Q\".\n\nThe second statement \"The grommet did not plop the frink\" can be written as \"Not Q\".\n\nTherefore, using Modus Tollens, we can infer \"Not P\", which means \"The grommet was not sploffed\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
