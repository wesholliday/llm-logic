            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of logical reasoning, specifically using Modus Tollens, which is a form of argument in classical logic. The argument has the form \"If P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\" \n\nIn this case, P represents \"The splat was morphed\" and Q represents \"The splat quanked\". \n\nThe first statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" is the conditional statement, or the 'if-then' statement. This can be written as \"P -> Q\". \n\nThe second statement \"The splat did not quank\" is the negation of Q, or \"Not Q\". \n\nThe conclusion we are trying to draw is \"The splat was not morphed\", or \"Not P\". \n\nTo test if we can draw this conclusion, we apply Modus Tollens. If P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must be false. \n\nSo, if \"The splat was morphed\" implies \"The splat quanked\", and \"The splat quanked\" is false, then \"The splat was morphed\" must be false. \n\nTherefore, from \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" and \"The splat did not quank\", we can infer \"The splat was not morphed\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
