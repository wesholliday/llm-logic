The statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled' is a conditional statement, also known as an 'if-then' statement. This statement means that cranking the sprocket implies that the sprocket is daggled, but it doesn't necessarily mean that dangling the sprocket implies that it was cranked.\n\nThe second statement given is 'The sprocket was not daggled'. Given that the first statement only implies that cranking the sprocket results in it being daggled, and not the other way around, we cannot infer that the sprocket was not cranked. It is possible that some other action could have resulted in the sprocket being daggled, or it could have been daggled without any action being taken.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that 'The sprocket was not cranked'.\n\nAnswer: No."
