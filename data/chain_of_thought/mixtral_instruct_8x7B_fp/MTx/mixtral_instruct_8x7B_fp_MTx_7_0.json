The information given consists of two statements:\n\n1. If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\n2. The whiffle did not tink.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer from these statements that \"The whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\nTo do this, we need to understand the concept of logical implication. The first statement is an implication: \"If A, then B.\" This means that if A is true, then B must be true as well. However, if B is false, we cannot necessarily conclude that A is false. This is known as logical fallacy of denying the consequent.\n\nIn this case, the first statement is \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\" So, if the whiffle was shanked, it would tink. But the second statement tells us that the whiffle did not tink. It doesn't necessarily mean that the whiffle was not shanked. It could be the case that the whiffle was shanked, but for some reason, it didn't tink.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\nAnswer: No."
