However, it does not imply or suggest that the wumble is also a \"snork zibber quank\". The second statement \"The wumble might be plonk flump and snork zibber quank\" is making a different claim, one that includes an additional state for the wumble. Without specific information indicating that the wumble can be in multiple states simultaneously, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: No."
