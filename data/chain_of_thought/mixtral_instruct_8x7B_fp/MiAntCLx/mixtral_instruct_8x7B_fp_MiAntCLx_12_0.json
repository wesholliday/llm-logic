However, this statement does not exclude the possibility of additional outcomes or characteristics for the flimble.\n\nThe proposed new statement \"The flimble might be grazzle by glorp and be blimp quank\" suggests that the flimble not only becomes grazzle through glorp but also acquires the properties of a blimp quank. This statement is more specific and inclusive than the original one.\n\nSince the original statement does not deny or contradict the possibility of the flimble being a blimp quank, we can infer the new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
