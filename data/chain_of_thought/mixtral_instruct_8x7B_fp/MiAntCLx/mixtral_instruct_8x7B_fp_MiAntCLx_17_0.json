For example, if we knew that \"zooble\" and \"blurble by froodle\" were related states that often occurred together, then it might be reasonable to infer the second statement from the first.\n\nHowever, in the absence of any such information or context, we cannot infer the second statement from the first. The first statement is making a claim only about the possibility of the blimp being zooble, and does not provide any information about the possibility of the blimp being blurble by froodle.\n\nAnswer: No."
