However, it does not exclude or include the possibility of the floob being in other locations. The statement \"The floob might be at flump blimp and in the quibble glorp\" implies that the floob is in two places at once - at the flump blimp and in the quibble glorp. Since the original statement does not specify that the floob is exclusively at the flump blimp, we cannot infer that it is also in the quibble glorp based solely on the initial information provided.\n\nAnswer: No."
