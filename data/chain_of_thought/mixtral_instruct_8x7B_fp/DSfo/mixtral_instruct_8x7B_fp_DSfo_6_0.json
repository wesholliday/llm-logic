            "content": "Explanation: The second statement 'Either the phone is ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room' is a form of disjunction, which means that only one of the two options can be true at a given time. If we know that the first statement 'The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen' is true, then the second option of the disjunction 'Either...or' must be true, which is 'it is in the living room'. Therefore, based on this logical reasoning, we can infer that 'The phone is in the living room'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
