The second statement provides us with an exhaustive list of possible locations for the book - it's either on the table or on the shelf.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the book is not on the table, and the second statement tells us that those are the only two possibilities, it must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
