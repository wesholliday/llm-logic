The first statement negates the possibility of the cat playing in the bedroom. The second statement presents two possibilities: the cat is playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch. Since we know from the first statement that the cat is not playing in the bedroom, the second possibility must be true, which is 'the cat is napping on the couch'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
