Either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\n\nThe second statement is a logical disjunction (OR statement), which means one or the other could be true. However, the first statement negates the second part of the second statement, as it clearly states that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet. Therefore, based on the process of elimination and the given information, we can infer that the keys must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
