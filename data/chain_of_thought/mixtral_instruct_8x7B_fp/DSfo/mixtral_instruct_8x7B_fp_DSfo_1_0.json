The statement 'Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside' is a disjunction, which means that it is true if either of its disjuncts is true. In this case, the disjunct 'Fido is in the garden' is false, since we know that Fido is not in the garden. However, this does not mean that the entire disjunction is false. It is still possible that the other disjunct 'Fido is inside' is true. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'Fido is inside' based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No."
