            "content": "Explanation: The first statement, \"The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack\", means that the scarf is not located on the coat rack. The second statement, \"Either the scarf is draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack\", is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two options must be true. Given that the first option is false (because we know the scarf is not on the coat rack), it follows that the second option must be true. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
