Either the watch is on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser.\n\nThe second statement is a disjunction (or) statement, which means one of the two parts must be true. In this case, the first part is that the watch is on his wrist, but the first statement tells us this is not the case. Therefore, the second part of the disjunction statement must be true: the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
