Either the toy is sitting on the shelf or it is in the toy box.\n\nFrom the second statement, since the first part \"The toy is sitting on the shelf\" is negated in the first statement, it implies that the second part of the second statement must be true. Therefore, the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
