The second statement provides us with another possibility for where the shoes could be, namely \"they are in the closet\". \n\nSince the first statement does not give us any information about whether the shoes might be in the closet, we cannot definitively conclude that they are in the closet based on these two statements alone. It's possible that the shoes are in the closet, but it's also possible that they're somewhere else entirely.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The shoes are in the closet' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No."
