            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The pen isn't on my desk' means that the pen is not located on the desk. The second statement, 'Either the pen is on my desk or it is in my bag', is a logical disjunction, which means that one (or both) of the two parts must be true. In this case, since we know that the pen is not on the desk, it follows that the pen must be in the bag. This is an example of logical reasoning using the principle of disjunction elimination.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
