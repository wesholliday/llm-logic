The second statement \"Either the newspaper is sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway\" presents two possible locations for the newspaper - on the porch or in the driveway. Since we know from the first statement that the newspaper is not on the porch, it must therefore be in the only other location specified, which is the driveway.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
