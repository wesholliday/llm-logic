Either the sunglasses are perched on her head or they are in her bag.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that there are only two possible locations for the sunglasses - they are either on her head or in her bag. \n\nThe first statement tells us that the sunglasses are not on her head. Since these are the only two possible locations, and we now know that they are not on her head, it follows logically that they must be in the other location - her bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
