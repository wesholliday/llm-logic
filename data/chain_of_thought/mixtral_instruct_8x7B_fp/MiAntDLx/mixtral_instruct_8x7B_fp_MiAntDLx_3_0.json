In this case, it's saying that the plimp might be in the wump (one possibility) or on the snorkel (another possibility). The word \"might\" indicates uncertainty. Therefore, the statement does not exclude the possibility that the plimp might be in the wump. It's one of the two possible scenarios presented.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
