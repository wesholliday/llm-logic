In this case, the possibilities are 'grazzle' and 'quank'. The word 'or' is used in the inclusive sense, meaning that both possibilities could be true. However, the statement does not exclude the possibility that the wump might only be a 'grazzle' and not a 'quank'. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot rule out the possibility that 'The wump might be grazzle'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
