            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The fribble might be on the blurble or in the wobble' is a disjunction, meaning it presents two possibilities: the fribble being on the blurble, or the fribble being in the wobble. A disjunction is true if at least one of its parts is true. Therefore, if this statement is true, then either 'the fribble might be on the blurble' or 'the fribble might be in the wobble' (or both) could be true. Since we have no information that contradicts 'the fribble might be on the blurble', we can infer that it is a possibility.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
