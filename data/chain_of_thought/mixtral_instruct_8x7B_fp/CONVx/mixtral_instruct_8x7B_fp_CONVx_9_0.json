The hypothesis is \"the twonk was plinked\" and the conclusion is \"it was varnished\". \n\nTo determine if the converse of this statement is true, we reverse the hypothesis and the conclusion to get \"If the twonk was varnished, then it was plinked\". \n\nHowever, just because the original statement is true, it does not automatically mean that the converse is also true. We would need additional information to confirm this. \n\nAnswer: No."
