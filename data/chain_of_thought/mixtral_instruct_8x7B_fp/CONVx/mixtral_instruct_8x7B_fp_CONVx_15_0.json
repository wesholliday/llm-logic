However, it does not guarantee the reverse, i.e., the truth of the consequent does not ensure the truth of the antecedent.\n\nHowever, in this specific case, the statement \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was vroombed\" is logically equivalent to the original statement, because both statements describe a one-to-one correspondence between the antecedent and the consequent.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
