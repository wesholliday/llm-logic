            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" is in the form of a conditional statement, often referred to as P implies Q. The logical structure of this statement can be represented as:\n\nP: The grommet was sploffed\nQ: The grommet plopped the frink\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was sploffed,\" which is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nHowever, without knowing whether the original statement is true or false, we cannot definitively say if the contrapositive is true. But since we are only asked if we can infer it and not if it is actually true, we can say that it is logically valid to make this inference based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
