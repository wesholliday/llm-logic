We would need to be given additional information about the relationship between \"flug being blummed\" and \"flug being zimmed\" to make this determination.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information alone, we cannot infer that \"If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was blummed\".\n\nAnswer: No."
