The statement can be rephrased as \"P -> Q\", where \"P\" is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and \"Q\" is \"the fribble crinked\". \n\nTo determine if the converse of this statement is true, we need to examine the statement \"If Q, then P\", or in other words, \"If the fribble crinked, then the fribble was snurgled\". \n\nHowever, just because the original statement is true, it does not necessarily mean that the converse is also true. In order to determine if the converse is true, we would need more information about the relationship between snurgling and crinkling fribbles.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that \"If the fribble crinked, then the fribble was snurgled\" based solely on the original statement."
