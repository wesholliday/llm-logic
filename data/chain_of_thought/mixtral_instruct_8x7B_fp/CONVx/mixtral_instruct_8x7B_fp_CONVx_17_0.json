The validity of this inference depends on the logical principle of contrapositive, which states that \"if p then q\" is logically equivalent to \"if not q then not p\". \n\nIn this case, \"the flob was skizzled\" is p and \"the flob movated\" is q. The given statement is \"if p then q\", which is \"if the flob was skizzled then it movated\". \n\nWe want to infer \"if q then p\", which is \"if the flob movated then it was skizzled\". \n\nAccording to the principle of contrapositive, this inference is valid. \n\nAnswer: Yes."
