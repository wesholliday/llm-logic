This is also a material conditional, where the truth of the entire statement depends on the truth of its consequent (\"the clug was fleeked\") given the truth of its antecedent (\"the clug snugged\").\n\nHowever, just because the original statement is true, we cannot automatically assume that its converse is also true. We would need additional information about the relationship between fleeking and snugging to make that determination.\n\nAnswer: No."
