            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical reasoning question that involves a concept called contrapositive. The original statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" can be written in logical notation as \"P -> Q\", where P represents \"the splat was morphed\" and Q represents \"the splat quanked\". The statement we want to infer is \"If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed\", which can be written as \"Q -> P\".\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement \"P -> Q\" is \"not Q -> not P\". The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if we can form the contrapositive of the original statement and show that it is equivalent to the statement we want to infer, then we can indeed make the inference.\n\nThe contrapositive of \"P -> Q\" is \"not Q -> not P\", which can be written as \"the splat did not quank -> the splat was not morphed\". This statement is clearly not equivalent to \"If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed\", because they have different antecedents (the splat did not quank vs. the splat quanked). Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
