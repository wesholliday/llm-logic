However, this does not allow us to infer the converse, which is what 'If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was cranked' represents. The reason is that even though the two statements are logically equivalent, the original statement only provides evidence for the truth of the conclusion when the hypothesis is true, not the other way around.\n\nAnswer: No."
