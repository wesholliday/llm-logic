This means it could be in any state other than being smoogled.\n\nThe second statement, \"Either the zinger is fraggled or it is smoogled,\" presents us with two possibilities: the zinger is either fraggled or smoogled. However, since we already know from the first statement that the zinger is not smoogled, this leaves us with only one possibility: the zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
