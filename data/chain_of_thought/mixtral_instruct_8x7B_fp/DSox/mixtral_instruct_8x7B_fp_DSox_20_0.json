The second statement can be broken down into two separate possibilities: 1) The fleeg is bluttered and 2) The fleeg is surned. However, the first statement already negates the second possibility by stating \"The fleeg is not surned\". Therefore, if the first statement is true, then only the first possibility from the second statement remains, which is \"The fleeg is bluttered\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
