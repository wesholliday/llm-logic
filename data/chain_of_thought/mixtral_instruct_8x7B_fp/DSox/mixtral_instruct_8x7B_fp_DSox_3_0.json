To infer whether the splat is morphed or not, we need to examine the possible scenarios based on these statements.\n\nIf the splat is not quanked (first statement), then we are left with two possibilities for the splat's state, as stated in the second sentence: it is either morphed or quanked. However, since we already know that it is not quanked, the only remaining possibility is that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
