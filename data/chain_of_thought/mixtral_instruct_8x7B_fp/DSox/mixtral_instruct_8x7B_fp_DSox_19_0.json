This means that the smonk does not have the property of being plagged.\n\nThe second statement is \"Either the smonk is vreebled or it is plagged\". This is a disjunctive statement, meaning it has two possible parts, one of which must be true. In this case, the statement is saying that the smonk is either vreebled or plagged.\n\nGiven that we know from the first statement that the smonk is not plagged, we can infer that the second statement must be true because of its first part: \"The smonk is vreebled\". This is because if the second statement were not true, then the smonk would have to be plagged, which we know is not the case.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The smonk is vreebled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
