It could be plooked, or it could have some other status that we don't know about. The statement 'Either the shank is plooked or it is nugged' means that the shank can only have one of two possible states: it is either plooked or nugged. It cannot be both, and it cannot have any other state.\n\nGiven these two statements, it is possible that the shank is plooked. We know that it is not nugged, and we also know that it must be either plooked or nugged. Since it can't be nugged, it must be plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
