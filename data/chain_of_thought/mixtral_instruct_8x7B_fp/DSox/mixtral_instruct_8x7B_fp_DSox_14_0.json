The statement \"Either the clug is fleeked or it is snugged\" presents two possibilities for the state of the clug: it is either \"fleeked\" or \"snugged\". Since we know from the first statement that the clug is not \"snugged\", it must be in the other state described in the second statement, which is \"fleeked\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
