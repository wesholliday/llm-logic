            "content": "Explanation: In the statement 'The sprocket is not daggled', we are told that the sprocket's state is not 'daggled'. In the second statement, 'Either the sprocket is cranked or it is daggled', we have an example of a disjunction, or 'or' statement. Disjunctions can be exclusive or inclusive. An exclusive disjunction means that only one of the two options can be true, while an inclusive disjunction means that one, or both, of the options can be true.\n\nIn this case, the context and the use of 'either' suggest that this is an exclusive disjunction. This means that the sprocket can only be in one of two states: 'cranked' or 'daggled'. Since we know from the first statement that the sprocket is not 'daggled', it must be in the other state: 'cranked'.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
