The first statement 'The wug is not garbled' tells us that the wug is in a state other than garbled. The second statement 'Either the wug is sproinged or it is garbled' gives us two possibilities for the state of the wug, either sproinged or garbled.\n\nSince we already know from the first statement that the wug is not garbled, it means that the only remaining possibility from the second statement must be true. Therefore, the wug must be sproinged.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
