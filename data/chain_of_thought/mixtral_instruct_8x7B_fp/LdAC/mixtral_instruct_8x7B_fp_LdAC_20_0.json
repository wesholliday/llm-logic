            "content": "Explanation: This question is testing the concept of logical deduction using conditional statements. The given statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement, often referred to as a hypothetical syllogism in formal logic. \n\nTo understand this, let's break down the components:\n\n1. \"The apple was red\" is the hypothesis or the condition.\n2. \"The banana was yellow\" is the conclusion or the result of the condition being true.\n\nHowever, just because the conclusion is true, it doesn't necessarily mean the hypothesis is true as well. This is because there could be other reasons why the banana was yellow. For example, maybe the banana was ripe. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot logically deduce that 'The apple was red'.\n\nAnswer: No."
