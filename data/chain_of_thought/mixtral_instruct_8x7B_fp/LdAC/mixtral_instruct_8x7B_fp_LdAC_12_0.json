If the statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is true, and we know that \"Lucy went to the zoo\" (q is true), then it could be the case that Joe went to the park (p is true), or it could be the case that Joe didn't go to the park (p is false) and something else caused Lucy to go to the zoo. However, based on the information given, we cannot definitively conclude that Joe went to the park. We can only say that if Joe didn't go to the park, then Lucy still would have gone to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: No."
