            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical deduction using transitive inference. The original statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim' is in the form of a conditional statement, often referred to as 'if p then q'. The second statement 'The pants were denim' is 'q'. To determine if we can logically deduce 'The shirt was cotton' (or 'p'), we need to see if the given statements support this conclusion. In this case, they do. If the pants being denim is a direct result of the shirt being cotton (as stated in the first sentence), then having denim pants implies the existence of a cotton shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
