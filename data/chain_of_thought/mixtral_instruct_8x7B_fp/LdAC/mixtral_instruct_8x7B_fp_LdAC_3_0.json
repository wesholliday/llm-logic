            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can logically deduce that the book was written by James, we need to use logical reasoning.  The original statement is in the form \"if p, then q\".  This is called a conditional statement and can be symbolized as \"p -> q\".  The second statement is \"q\".  The question is asking if we can conclude \"p\" from \"q\" and \"p -> q\".  This is called logical deduction.\n\nIn this case, the original statement \"if the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" can be symbolized as \"James wrote the book -> mystery novel\".  The second statement \"the book is a mystery novel\" is \"mystery novel\".  To determine if we can logically deduce \"James wrote the book\", we need to see if \"mystery novel\" follows from \"James wrote the book -> mystery novel\" and \"mystery novel\".\n\nHowever, having a true conditional statement and a true conclusion does not necessarily mean that the hypothesis is true.  For example, consider the true statement \"if it is raining, then the ground is wet\".  If we observe that the ground is wet, we cannot conclude that it is raining because there could be other reasons why the ground is wet (e.g., a sprinkler was on).\n\nSimilarly, in this case, even if we know that the book is a mystery novel, it does not necessarily mean that James wrote the book.  There could be other authors who write mystery novels.  Therefore, we cannot logically deduce that \"The book was written by James\".\n\nAnswer: No."
