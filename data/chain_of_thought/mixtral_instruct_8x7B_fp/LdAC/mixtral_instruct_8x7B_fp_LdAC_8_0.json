            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of logical reasoning using conditional statements. The statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is called a conditional statement and can be written in logical notation as V -> M, where V represents 'the vampire was awake' and M represents 'the mummy was awake'.\n\nThe second statement given is 'The mummy was awake', which is represented as M.\n\nTo determine if we can logically deduce 'The vampire was awake', we need to see if the given statements imply V (the vampire was awake).\n\nUsing logical rules, if we have a conditional statement V -> M and we know that M is true, then we can conclude that V is true only if the conditional statement is not a coincidental truth. In other words, if there is no possible scenario where V is false but M is true, then we can conclude that V is true.\n\nIn this case, since we know that M is true, and the only way for M to be true in the conditional statement V -> M is if V is also true, we can logically deduce that V is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
