            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical deduction using the concept of conditional statements.  The original statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\".  The second statement \"Jen watched basketball\" is the consequent Q of the original conditional statement.  However, the truth of the consequent Q does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent P in a conditional statement.  Therefore, even if Jen did watch basketball, Tom watching football is not a guaranteed conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No."
