            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical deduction using transitive inference. The statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' is a conditional statement, often written as \"doll is plastic -> truck is metal\". The second statement is \"truck is metal\". \n\nTo deduce whether the doll is plastic, we need to apply modus ponens, a rule of inference that allows us to infer a conclusion from two premises. The premises are the conditional statement and the statement that affirms the antecedent (the 'if' part of the conditional statement). In this case, the antecedent is 'the doll was plastic'.\n\nGiven 'the doll was plastic' and 'if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal', we can indeed infer 'the truck was metal' (this is the application of modus ponens). However, this does not directly tell us whether the doll was plastic.\n\nBut, in our case, we are given the additional information that 'the truck was metal'. Given 'if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal', and 'the truck was metal', we cannot directly infer 'the doll was plastic'. This is because there could be other reasons why the truck is metal, and the statement 'if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' does not exclude those other possibilities.\n\nTherefore, while we can deduce that 'the truck was metal', we cannot logically deduce 'the doll was plastic' from these statements.\n\nAnswer: No."
