This is also known as a material implication, where if the hypothesis (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the conclusion (Sue was at the wedding) is also true. However, if the conclusion is true, it does not necessarily mean that the hypothesis is true. This is known as fallacy of affirming the consequent. In this case, since Sue was at the wedding, it doesn't guarantee that Mary was at the wedding. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce that 'Mary was at the wedding'. Answer: No."
