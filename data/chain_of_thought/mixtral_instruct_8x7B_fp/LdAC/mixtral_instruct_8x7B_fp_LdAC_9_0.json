            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument in the form of a conditional statement, also known as a hypothesis or \"if-then\" statement. The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is broken down into two parts: the antecedent (if Lisa bought the red shirt) and the consequent (then Mark bought the blue shirt). \n\nWhen we are given the additional information that \"Mark bought the blue shirt\", we can use this new information to determine if the original conditional statement is true. This is known as modus ponens in logic, where if both the conditional statement and the consequent are true, then the antecedent must also be true.\n\nTherefore, since we know that \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true, and this implies that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" must also be true based on the conditional statement, we can logically deduce that 'Lisa bought the red shirt'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
