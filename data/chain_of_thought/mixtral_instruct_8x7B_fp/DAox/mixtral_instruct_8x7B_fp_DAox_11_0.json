However, since we know that the flug was not blummed, this implies that the condition for the flug being zimmed has not been met.\n4. Therefore, even though the given statement does not directly tell us that the flug was not zimmed, the logical conclusion is that it wasn't, because the condition for it to be zimmed was not satisfied.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
