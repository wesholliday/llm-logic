Also given: \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\"\n3. We want to find out if we can conclude: \"The smonk was not plagged.\"\n\nTo infer that \"The smonk was not plagged,\" we need to show that there is no possibility of the smonk plagging, given the two statements.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means it only applies if the condition (the smonk being vreebled) is true. However, the first statement tells us that the smonk was not vreebled. As a result, the condition of the second statement is false, and the second statement does not apply.\n\nSince the second statement doesn't apply, we cannot conclude that the smonk plagged. In fact, since the smonk was not vreebled, there is no reason to assume that the smonk plagged.\n\nAnswer: No."
