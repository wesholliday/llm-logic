'If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished' - This statement tells us that plinking (whatever that means in this context) implies varnishing. It doesn't say that varnishing implies plinking, only that plinking is a sufficient condition for varnishing.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot infer that 'The twonk was not varnished'. Just because the twonk wasn't plinked, it doesn't mean it couldn't have been varnished some other way. The given statement only tells us that plinking and varnishing are related, but not how they are related to other possible actions or states of the twonk.\n\nAnswer: No."
