If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\n\nWe're asked if we can infer that \"The shank was not nugged\" from this information.\n\nTo do this, we need to consider whether the second statement only applies when the shank is plooked. In other words, does the shank being nugged necessarily follow from the shank being plooked, and vice versa?\n\nIn this case, the second statement tells us that if the shank has been plooked, then it has also been nugged. However, it doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the shank is not plooked. It could be the case that the shank can only be nugged when it's plooked, or it could be possible for the shank to be nugged even when it's not plooked.\n\nWithout further information, we cannot definitively conclude that the shank was not nugged based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No."
