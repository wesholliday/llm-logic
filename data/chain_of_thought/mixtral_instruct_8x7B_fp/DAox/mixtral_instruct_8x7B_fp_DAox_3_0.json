The given information includes \"The splat was not morphed\" and \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\". This can be rephrased as \"If not morphed, then not quanked\" or \"If not quanked, then not morphed\". Based on this, we can infer that if the splat was not morphed, then it did not quank.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
