This means that the flugel does not have the characteristic or condition of being blimmed.\n\n2. The second statement is \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled\". This is a conditional statement, often referred to as an \"if-then\" statement. It means that if the flugel had the characteristic or condition of being blimmed, then it would also have the characteristic or condition of being zargled.\n\n3. Now, we want to infer whether \"The flugel was not zargled\" is true or false based on these two statements. \n\n4. However, the given statements do not provide enough information to make this inference. The second statement only tells us what would happen if the flugel were blimmed, but it does not tell us anything about what happens when the flugel is not blimmed.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, we cannot infer that 'The flugel was not zargled'.\n\nAnswer: No."
