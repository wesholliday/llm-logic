If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated (given).\n\nFrom these two statements, we want to determine if we can conclude that the flob was not movated.\n\nTo do this, let's consider what the second statement is telling us: if the flob was skizzled, then it movated. However, the first statement tells us that the flob was not skizzled. Since the flob was not skizzled, the second statement does not apply, and we cannot determine whether the flob movated or not.\n\nThe given information does not allow us to conclude that the flob was not movated.\n\nAnswer: No."
