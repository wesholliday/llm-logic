However, we don't know what 'shanked' means in this context.\n2. \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\" is a conditional statement where the 'if' part is the hypothesis and the 'then' part is the conclusion.\n3. To determine if we can infer \"The whiffle did not tink\", we need to check if the negation of the conclusion contradicts the original statements.\n4. If the whiffle did not tink, then the negation of \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\" would be \"The whiffle was shanked and the whiffle did not tink\".\n5. This new statement does not contradict the original statements, so we cannot infer \"The whiffle did not tink\".\n\nAnswer: No."
