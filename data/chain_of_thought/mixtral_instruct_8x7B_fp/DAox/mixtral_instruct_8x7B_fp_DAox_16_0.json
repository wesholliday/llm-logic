            "content": "Explanation: This question involves logical reasoning, specifically using contrapositive reasoning. The given statement \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" can be written in logical form as:\n\np -> q\n\nwhere p represents \"the sneg was crampled\" and q represents \"the sneg sproted the frink\".\n\nThe contrapositive of this statement is:\n\n~q -> ~p\n\nwhich means \"if the sneg did not sprot the frink, then the sneg was not crampled\".\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer \"The sneg did not sprot the frink\" from \"The sneg was not crampled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
