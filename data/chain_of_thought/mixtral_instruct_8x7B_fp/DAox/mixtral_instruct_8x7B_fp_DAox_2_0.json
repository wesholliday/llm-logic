The second statement is \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The wug did not bim the zoint\" based on these two statements.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means it only applies if the condition (in this case, \"the wug was flooped\") is true. However, the first statement tells us that the wug did not floop, which means the condition in the second statement is not met.\n\nSince the condition in the second statement is not met, we cannot infer the conclusion \"The wug did not bim the zoint\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No."
