If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint (Statement 2 - this is a conditional statement)\n\nWe want to prove: The smip did not lup the zoint\n\nTo prove this, we can use the contrapositive of Statement 2, which is: If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped. This contrapositive statement is logically equivalent to Statement 2.\n\nNow, given Statement 1 (The smip was not shripped), using the contrapositive statement, we can indeed infer that The smip did not lup the zoint.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
