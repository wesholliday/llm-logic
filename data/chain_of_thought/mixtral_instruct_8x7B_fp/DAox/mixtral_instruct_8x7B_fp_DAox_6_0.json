We also know that \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n3. The question asks if we can infer \"The grommet did not plop the frink\" based on the given information.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to determine if the grommet not sploffing means that it also didn't plop the frink. Let's look at the second statement more closely. It says that if the grommet was sploffed, then it plopped the frink. This is a conditional statement, and its truth depends on the condition being met.\n\nIn our case, the condition (the grommet being sploffed) is not met because we were told that it didn't sploff. Since the condition is not met, the consequence (the grommet plopping the frink) doesn't necessarily follow. Therefore, we cannot infer that the grommet did not plop the frink based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No."
