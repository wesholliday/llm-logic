This statement tells us that if the 'if' clause were true, then the wug would be 'garbled'.\n\nHowever, since we know from the first statement that the 'if' clause is not true (because the wug was not sproinged), this means that the second part of the conditional statement does not necessarily have to be true. In other words, just because the wug wasn't sproinged, it doesn't mean it couldn't still be garbled through some other means.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, we cannot infer 'The wug was not garbled'.\n\nAnswer: No."
