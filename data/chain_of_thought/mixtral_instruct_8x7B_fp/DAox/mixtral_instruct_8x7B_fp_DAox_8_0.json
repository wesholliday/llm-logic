If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n\nWe want to determine if we can conclude that the sprocket was not daggled based on these two statements.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that it only applies when the sprocket is cranked. However, since we know from the first statement that the sprocket was not cranked, this condition is never met.\n\nAs a result, the second statement does not provide any information about whether the sprocket was daggled or not when it was not cranked. Therefore, we cannot infer that the sprocket was not daggled based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No."
