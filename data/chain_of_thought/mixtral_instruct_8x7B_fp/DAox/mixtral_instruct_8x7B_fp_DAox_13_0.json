'The glip was not slogged' means that the glip did not undergo some process or action denoted by 'slog.'\n2. 'If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged' is a conditional statement, which means if the first part (the glip being slogged) is true, then the second part (the glip being tragged) must also be true.\n\nHowever, the given information does not provide enough evidence to conclude that 'The glip was not tragged.' The second statement only tells us what would happen if the glip were slogged. Since we know that the glip was not slogged, this statement does not apply in this case. Therefore, we cannot infer that the glip was not tragged based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No."
