If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\n\nFrom the second statement, we can infer that fraggled and smoogled are related such that if something is fraggled, it must also be smoogled.\n\nHowever, the given information starts with the statement that the zinger is not fraggled. Since we know that not being fraggled implies not being smoogled either, we can conclude that the zinger is not smoogled.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
