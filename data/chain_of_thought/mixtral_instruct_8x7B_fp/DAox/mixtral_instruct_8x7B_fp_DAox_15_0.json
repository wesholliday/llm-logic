The second statement \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\" is a conditional statement, which means that if the first condition (dreb being vroombed) is true, then the second condition (dreb being spened) is also true. However, since the first condition is not true (as stated in the first sentence), the second condition is not evaluated. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The dreb was not spened\" based on the given statements.\nAnswer: No."
