If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\n\nFrom the second statement, we can derive a conditional relationship. If the condition (the fribble being snurgled) is true, then the consequence (the fribble crinkling) follows.\n\nHowever, the first statement tells us that the condition is false, because the fribble was not snurgled. In logic, when the condition of a conditional statement is false, the entire statement is considered to be true.\n\nSince the condition is false, we cannot infer anything about the consequence. It's possible that the fribble crinkled for some other reason, or it's possible that it didn't crinkle at all. The given information does not allow us to determine either way.\n\nAnswer: No."
