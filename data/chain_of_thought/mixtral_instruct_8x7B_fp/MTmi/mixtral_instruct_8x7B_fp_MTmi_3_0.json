            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel' is a conditional statement, also known as an 'if-then' statement. This statement means that if the condition (the book was written by James) is true, then the consequence (the book must be a mystery novel) must also be true.\n\nHowever, the second statement 'The book might not be a mystery novel' suggests that the book might not be a mystery novel, which contradicts the consequence of the original conditional statement.\n\nTo resolve this contradiction, we can infer that the condition of the original statement must be false, which means that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
