            "content": "Explanation: This question involves logical reasoning using conditional statements. The statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis' is a Type 2 conditional, which can be rewritten as 'If Jeff plays basketball, then Amy plays tennis'. This means that there is a direct relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis.\n\nThe second statement given is 'Amy might not have played tennis'. This is a Type 1 conditional, which can be rewritten as 'It is possible that Amy does not play tennis'.\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'Jeff did not play basketball' from these two statements, we need to consider the implications of 'Amy might not have played tennis'. This statement introduces the possibility that Amy did not play tennis, which contradicts the direct relationship established in the first statement.\n\nTherefore, if Amy did not play tennis, then it is not possible that Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
