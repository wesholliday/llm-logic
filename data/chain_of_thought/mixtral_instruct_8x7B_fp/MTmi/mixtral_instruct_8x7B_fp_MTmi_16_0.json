This is because even if there's a possibility that the pants are not denim, the shirt could still be cotton. The truth of B (pants being denim) does not affect the truth of A (shirt being cotton).\n\nHowever, we cannot confirm that \"The shirt was cotton\" either, because the possibility of the pants not being denim means that the original conditional statement might not be fulfilled.\n\nAnswer: No."
