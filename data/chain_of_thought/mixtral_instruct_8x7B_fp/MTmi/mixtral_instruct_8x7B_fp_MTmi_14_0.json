            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den' is a conditional statement, often called if-then statement. This statement means that the condition of the bear being in the cave logically leads to the consequence that the wolf must have been in the den. However, the truth of the consequence does not necessarily mean the truth of the condition.\n\nThe statement 'The wolf might not have been in the den' indicates that the wolf being in the den is not certain, which contradicts the consequence of our conditional statement above. \n\nIf the wolf might not have been in the den, then the condition (the bear being in the cave) that leads to the consequence (the wolf must have been in the den) might not have occurred. Therefore, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
