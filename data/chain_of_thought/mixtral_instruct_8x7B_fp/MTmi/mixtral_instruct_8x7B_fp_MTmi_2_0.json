            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest' is a conditional statement, also known as a logical if-then statement. It tells us that the existence of the griffin in the forest is sufficient for the existence of the unicorn in the forest. However, it does not tell us that the existence of the griffin is necessary for the existence of the unicorn.\n\nThe statement 'The unicorn might not have been in the forest' is a possibility statement, indicating that the presence of the unicorn in the forest is uncertain.\n\nBased on these two statements, we cannot infer that 'The griffin was not in the forest'. This is because the conditional statement only tells us that the griffin's presence implies the unicorn's presence, not the other way around. Therefore, even if the unicorn might not have been in the forest, the griffin could still have been there.\n\nAnswer: No."
