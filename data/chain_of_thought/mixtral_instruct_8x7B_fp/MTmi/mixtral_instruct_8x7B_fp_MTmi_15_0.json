            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train' is a conditional statement, often called a hypothetical or \"if-then\" statement. This statement means that Sam taking a plane is a sufficient condition for Erin taking a train, but it does not necessarily mean that Sam taking a plane is the only condition for Erin taking a train.\n\nThe statement 'Erin might not have taken a train' is a possibility statement, indicating that Erin taking a train is not certain.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that 'Sam did not take a plane'. This is because the first statement only tells us that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train, but it does not tell us that Sam actually took a plane. The second statement tells us that there is a possibility that Erin did not take a train, but it does not necessarily mean that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nTherefore, it is possible that Sam took a plane and Erin took some other mode of transportation, or that neither of them took the modes of transportation mentioned in the conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
