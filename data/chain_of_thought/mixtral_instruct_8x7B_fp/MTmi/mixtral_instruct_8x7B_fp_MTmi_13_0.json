            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue' is a conditional statement, often called if-then statement in logic. It means that the truck being blue is a necessary condition for the car being red. \n\nThe second statement 'The truck might not have been blue' indicates that the necessary condition for the car being red might not have been met. \n\nIf the necessary condition for a statement is not met, then the statement cannot be true. Therefore, from these two statements, we can infer that the car could not have been red.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
