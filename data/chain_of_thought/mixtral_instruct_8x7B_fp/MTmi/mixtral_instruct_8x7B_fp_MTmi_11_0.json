            "content": "Explanation: This question involves reasoning through conditional statements and negations. \n\nFirst, let's break down the given information:\n1. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry. This is a conditional statement where the condition (cake being chocolate) leads to a consequence (muffins being blueberry).\n2. The muffins might not have been blueberry. This means there's a possibility that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the cake was not chocolate. If the cake was not chocolate, then according to the first statement, it doesn't necessarily mean the muffins have to be blueberry; they could be any flavor or even not exist at all. Therefore, the second statement \"The muffins might not have been blueberry\" still holds true regardless of whether the cake is chocolate or not.\n\nHowever, the given statements do not allow us to definitively conclude that \"The cake was not chocolate\". The most we can say is that the color of the muffins does not depend on the cake's flavor in this scenario.\n\nAnswer: No."
