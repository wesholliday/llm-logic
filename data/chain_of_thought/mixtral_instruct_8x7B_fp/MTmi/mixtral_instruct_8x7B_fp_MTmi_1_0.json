            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding' is a conditional statement, often called if-then statement. This statement means that Mary's presence at the wedding guarantees Sue's presence. However, Sue's possible absence does not necessarily mean that Mary was absent. It's possible that Sue is not at the wedding even if Mary is there. But it's also possible that neither of them were at the wedding. The given information doesn't exclude this possibility.\n\nAnswer: No."
