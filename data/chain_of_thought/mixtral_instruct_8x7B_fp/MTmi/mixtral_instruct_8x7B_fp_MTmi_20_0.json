            "content": "Explanation: This question involves conditional logic and reasoning about possibilities. \n\nFirst, let's break down the first statement: 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow'. This is a form of implication known as a conditional statement. It means that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the consequence (the banana being yellow) must also be true.\n\nHowever, the second statement tells us that 'The banana might not have been yellow', which implies that there is a possibility that the banana was not yellow.\n\nIf we assume that the first statement is true, then the only way for the second statement to be true is if the condition in the first statement is false, i.e., the apple was not red.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The apple was not red'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
