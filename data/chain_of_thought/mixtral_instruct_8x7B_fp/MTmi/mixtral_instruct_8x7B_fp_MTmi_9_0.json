            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement, often called if-then statement. This means that if the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\nHowever, the statement 'Mark might not have bought the blue shirt' indicates that there is a possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This means that the condition (Mark buying the blue shirt) is not necessarily true.\n\nNow, if the condition (Mark buying the blue shirt) is not necessarily true, then the whole conditional statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt' cannot be true either. This is because, in a conditional statement, if the condition is not true, then the whole statement is considered false, regardless of the truth value of the consequence.\n\nTherefore, if we assume that the second statement is true (Mark might not have bought the blue shirt), then the first statement cannot be true, and so Lisa buying the red shirt is not a necessary condition for Mark buying the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt."
