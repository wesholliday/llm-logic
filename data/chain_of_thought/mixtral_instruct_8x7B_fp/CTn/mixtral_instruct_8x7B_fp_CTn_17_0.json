The original statement is in the form \"If P, then not Q\", where P is \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q is \"Kate ate the salad\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If Q, then not P\", which means \"If Kate ate the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\". Since the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
