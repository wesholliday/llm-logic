This can be restated as \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\" by swapping the positions of Mary and Sue and negating both. This new statement is logically equivalent to the original, so yes, we can infer 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
