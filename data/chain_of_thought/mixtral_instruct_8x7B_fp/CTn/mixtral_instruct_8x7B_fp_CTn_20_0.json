            "content": "Explanation: This question is an example of a logical concept called contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". \n\nIn this case, the original statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow\". Here, P represents \"the apple was red\" and Q represents \"the banana was not yellow\". \n\nSo, the contrapositive would be \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red\". \n\nSince these two statements are logically equivalent (meaning they have the same truth value), we can infer 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
