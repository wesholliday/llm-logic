            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument in the form of a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. The original statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\" can be written in logical notation as:\n\nJ \u2192 \u00acL\n\nwhere J represents \"Joe went to the park\" and L represents \"Lucy went to the zoo,\" and the symbol \"\u00ac\" denotes negation (not).\n\nThe statement we want to infer is \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park,\" which can be written as:\n\nL \u2192 \u00acJ\n\nTo determine if we can validly infer the second statement from the first, we can use a technique called contrapositive reasoning. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and swapping their positions. The contrapositive of the original statement J \u2192 \u00acL is therefore \u00ac\u00acL \u2192 \u00acJ, which simplifies to L \u2192 \u00acJ. Since this is identical to the statement we want to infer, we can indeed validly infer \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
