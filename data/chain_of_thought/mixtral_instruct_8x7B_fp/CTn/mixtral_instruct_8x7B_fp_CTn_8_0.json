A contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement and then swapping their positions. Since the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
