            "content": "Explanation: This is a form of logical reasoning called contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". \n\nIn this case, the original statement is \"If the car was red (P), then the truck was not blue (Q)\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the truck was blue (not Q), then the car was not red (not P)\".\n\nSince they are contrapositives, they are logically equivalent. Therefore, from the original statement, we can infer 'If the truck was blue, then the car was not red'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
