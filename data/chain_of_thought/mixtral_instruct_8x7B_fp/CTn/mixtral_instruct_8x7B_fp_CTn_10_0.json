            "content": "Explanation: This statement is an example of a logical construct known as a contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". \n\nIn this case, the original statement is \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was not outside\". Here, P represents \"the dog was inside\" and Q represents \"the cat was not outside\". \n\nSo, the contrapositive would be \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside\", where 'not Q' is \"the cat was outside\" and 'not P' is \"the dog was not inside\".\n\nSince the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent (meaning they have the same truth value), we can indeed infer 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
