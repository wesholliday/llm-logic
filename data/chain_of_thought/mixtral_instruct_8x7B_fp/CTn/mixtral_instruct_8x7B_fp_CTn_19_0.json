            "content": "Explanation: This question is an example of a logical concept called contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement (in this case, \"If Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball\") is formed by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion and then reversing the order. So the contrapositive of \"If Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball\" is \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football\". If the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true, and we can infer the contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
