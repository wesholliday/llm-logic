            "content": "Explanation: This statement is an example of a logical concept known as contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. If the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa. In this case, the original statement is 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest'. The negation of this statement is 'If the griffin was not in the forest'. The contrapositive of the original statement is therefore 'If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest'. Since the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
