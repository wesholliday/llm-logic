The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning they have the same truth value.\n\nTherefore, from 'If the book was written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel', we can infer 'If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
