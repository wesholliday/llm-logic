            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was not metal' is a conditional statement in the form of 'if p then q'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'if not q then not p'. In this case, 'not q' is 'the truck was not metal' and 'not p' is 'the doll was not plastic'. So, the contrapositive of the given statement is 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic'. Since the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can infer 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
