            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\". The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis\" can be written as \"If P, then not Q\". What we are asked to infer is \"If not Q, then P\", or in other words, \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\". This is an example of the logical fallacy called \"denying the antecedent\". If the original statement is true, then the inferred statement is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No."
