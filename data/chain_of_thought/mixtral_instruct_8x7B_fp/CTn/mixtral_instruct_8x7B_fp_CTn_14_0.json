            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den' is a conditional statement in the form of 'if p, then q'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'if not q, then not p', which can be rephrased as 'If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave'. The advantage of using the contrapositive is that it has the same truth value as the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
