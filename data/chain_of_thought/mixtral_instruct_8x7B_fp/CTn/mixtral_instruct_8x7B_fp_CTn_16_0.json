            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim' is in the form of a conditional statement, specifically a Type 2 conditional. It tells us that if a certain condition is met (shirt being cotton), then a certain consequence follows (pants not being denim).\n\nTo determine if the converse of this statement is also true, we need to switch the hypothesis and conclusion. The converse would be 'If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton'.\n\nIn order for this converse to be logically equivalent to the original statement, the original statement must be true regardless of whether the pants are denim or not. In this case, the original statement only tells us about the situation when the shirt is cotton, not when it's not. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that if the pants are denim, the shirt must be not cotton.\n\nAnswer: No."
