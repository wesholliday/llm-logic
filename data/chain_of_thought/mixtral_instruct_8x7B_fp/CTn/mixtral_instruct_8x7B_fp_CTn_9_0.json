            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt' is a conditional statement in the form of 'if-then'.  The negation of this statement would be 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and 'Mark bought the blue shirt'.  The given statement does not explicitly state that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.  It only states the first part of this implication.  Therefore, we cannot infer the statement 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
