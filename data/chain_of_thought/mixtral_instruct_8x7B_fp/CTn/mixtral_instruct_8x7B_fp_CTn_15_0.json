            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin did not take a train' is a conditional statement in the form of 'if-then'. The negation of the conclusion 'Erin took a train' leads to 'Erin did not take a train'. Substituting this into the original statement, we get 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin did not take a train', which is the given statement. Therefore, the contrapositive of the given statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
