            "content": "Explanation: This is a logical reasoning question that involves evaluating a conditional statement and applying modus ponens, a rule of inference in logic. The given conditional statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical notation as: Mary \u2192 Sue. The second piece of information given is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"Mary was at the wedding,\" we need to see if the given information satisfies the conditions for applying modus ponens. Modus ponens states that from the premises P \u2192 Q and P, we can infer Q. In this case, P represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nGiven that the second piece of information is \"Sue was at the wedding,\" we have Q. However, we do not have P explicitly stated. However, since the first piece of information is a conditional statement where the consequent is Q, we can assume that P is true based on the given information that Q is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
