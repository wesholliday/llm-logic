            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical reasoning question using conditional statements. The original statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is in the form of a conditional statement P -> Q, where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue\". \n\nThe second statement given is \"The truck was blue\", which matches the consequence Q in our conditional statement. However, even if the consequence is true, it does not necessarily mean that the condition P is also true. This is because of the \"if\" in the original statement - just because the car being red would imply the truck being blue, it doesn't mean that the truck being blue implies the car being red. There could be other reasons why the truck is blue.\n\nTherefore, based on these two statements, we cannot infer that 'The car was red'.\n\nAnswer: No."
