            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument in the form of a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\". In this case, P represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q represents \"Amy played tennis\". This form of argument is called modus ponens, and it is a valid form of deductive reasoning. \n\nHowever, the argument also includes an additional piece of information, which is that \"Amy played tennis\" (Q) is true. In order to infer that \"Jeff played basketball\" (P) is true, we need to ensure that the truth of Q alone is sufficient to establish the truth of P. In other words, we need to make sure that there are no other factors that could cause Q to be true while P is false.\n\nIn this case, the original conditional statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" does not provide any information about other factors that could affect the truth of Q. Therefore, we can infer that if Q is true, then P must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
