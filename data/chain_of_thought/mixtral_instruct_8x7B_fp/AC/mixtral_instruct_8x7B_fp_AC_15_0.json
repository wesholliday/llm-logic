            "content": "Explanation: This is a logical reasoning question that involves evaluating a conditional statement and applying modus ponens, a rule of inference in logic. The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is a conditional statement, often denoted as \"Sam took a plane \u21d2 Erin took a train\". The second piece of information given is \"Erin took a train\", which is the consequent of our conditional statement. Modus ponens states that if you have a conditional statement and its consequent, you can infer the antecedent. In this case, the antecedent is \"Sam took a plane\". Therefore, given the truth of the conditional statement and \"Erin took a train\", we can indeed infer that \"Sam took a plane\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
