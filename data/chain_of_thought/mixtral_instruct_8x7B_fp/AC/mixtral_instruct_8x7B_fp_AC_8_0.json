            "content": "Explanation: This is a conditional statement: if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This means that the mummy's wakefulness is dependent on the vampire being awake. If we know that the mummy was awake, we can't directly infer that the vampire was awake as well, because there could be other reasons why the mummy is awake. However, in this case, since the mummy's wakefulness is dependent on the vampire's wakefulness (as stated in the conditional statement), we can indeed infer that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
