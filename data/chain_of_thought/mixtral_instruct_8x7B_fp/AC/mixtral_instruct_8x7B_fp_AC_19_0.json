            "content": "Explanation: This statement is an example of a logical proposition in the form of \"if p, then q\". This is called a conditional statement. The second statement, 'Jen watched basketball', is just a fact without any condition. To determine if we can infer that 'Tom watched football', we need to see if the second statement contradicts or supports the first statement's condition. In this case, it does not contradict. However, it also does not guarantee that Tom watched football. Jen watching basketball is compatible with both scenarios - Tom watching football and Tom not watching football. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that 'Tom watched football'.\n\nAnswer: No."
