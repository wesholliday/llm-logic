            "content": "Explanation: This is a logical reasoning question that follows the structure of a conditional statement, or an \"if-then\" statement. The first sentence, \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta,\" is the conditional statement. The second sentence, \"Bob chose pasta,\" is new information.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that Sue chose pizza, we need to consider the possible scenarios that would make the initial conditional statement and the new information true.\n\nIf the conditional statement is true, then there are two possibilities:\n1. Sue chose pizza, and therefore Bob chose pasta.\n2. Sue did not choose pizza, and therefore Bob did not choose pasta (this is called the contrapositive of the initial statement).\n\nNow, we are given the new information that Bob did choose pasta. This means that the second possibility (Sue did not choose pizza, and therefore Bob did not choose pasta) cannot be true, because we know that Bob did choose pasta.\n\nTherefore, the only remaining possibility is that Sue chose pizza, and the initial conditional statement is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
