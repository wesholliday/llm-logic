            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument in the form of a hypothetical syllogism. The original statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement, also known as a hypothetical proposition. This statement only allows us to make inferences when the condition is met.\n\nIn this case, the second statement \"The banana was yellow\" does not provide enough information to determine if the condition in the first statement is met. We cannot assume that the apple was red just because the banana was yellow. There could be other reasons why the banana was yellow, unrelated to the color of the apple.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the apple was red.\n\nAnswer: No."
