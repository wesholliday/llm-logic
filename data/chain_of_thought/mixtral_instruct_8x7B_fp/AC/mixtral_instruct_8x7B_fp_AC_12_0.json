If the statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is true, and we know that \"Lucy went to the zoo\" (q is true), then it could be the case that Joe went to the park (p is true). However, it's not 100% certain because there might be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo. But based on the given information, we can infer that Joe probably went to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
