            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of logical reasoning using if-then statements, also known as conditional statements. The original statement is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be broken down into two parts: the antecedent (the part before the 'then') and the consequent (the part after the 'then'). In this case, the antecedent is \"the book was written by James\" and the consequent is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"The book is a mystery novel.\" To determine if we can infer \"The book was written by James,\" we need to see if the second statement matches the consequent of the original statement. If it does, this means that the original statement's consequent is true. However, to conclude that the original statement's antecedent is also true, we need to apply a logical rule called \"modus ponens.\" Modus ponens states that if the original statement is true and its antecedent matches the given information, then the antecedent must be true.\n\nIn this case, the second statement matches the consequent of the original statement, but we still need to apply modus ponens to ensure that the antecedent is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
