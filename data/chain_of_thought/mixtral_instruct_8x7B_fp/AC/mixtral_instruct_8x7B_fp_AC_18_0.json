            "content": "Explanation: This is an application of logical reasoning, specifically modus ponens. The given statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is a conditional statement, also known as a hypothetical proposition. It tells us that if the doll has a certain property (being plastic), then the truck has a certain property (being metal). The second statement, \"The truck was metal\", is the consequent part of the conditional statement. \n\nTo infer whether the doll was plastic or not, we need to determine if the condition for the doll being plastic is met. In this case, the condition is not explicitly stated to be met. However, since the given statement \"The truck was metal\" is a possible consequent of the conditional statement, it suggests that the condition for the doll being plastic might be true. But without further information, we cannot definitively conclude that the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: No."
