            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical reasoning principle called \"modus ponens.\" The first statement, \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest,\" is a conditional statement, also known as a hypothetical or \"if-then\" statement. The second statement, \"The unicorn was in the forest,\" is an assertion of fact.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the griffin was in the forest, we need to consider whether the first statement (the condition) and the second statement (the fact) match up in a way that would allow us to draw that conclusion.\n\nIn this case, the second statement tells us that the unicorn was in the forest. According to the first statement, if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest. Since we know that the unicorn was in the forest, it follows that the griffin must have been in the forest as well.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can indeed infer that the griffin was in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
