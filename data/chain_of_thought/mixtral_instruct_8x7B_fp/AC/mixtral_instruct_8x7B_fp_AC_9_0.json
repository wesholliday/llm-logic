This is in the form of if-then statement P -> Q, where P is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and Q is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. \n\nGiven that Q is true (Mark bought the blue shirt), we cannot directly infer that P is true (Lisa bought the red shirt). This is because even if the consequence (Mark bought the blue shirt) is true, the condition (Lisa bought the red shirt) might not be true. It could be that Mark bought the blue shirt for some other reason and Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is an example of a fallacy known as affirming the consequent.\n\nAnswer: No."
