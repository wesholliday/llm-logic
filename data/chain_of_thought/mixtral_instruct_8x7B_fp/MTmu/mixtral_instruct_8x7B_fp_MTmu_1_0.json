            "content": "Explanation: This is a logical reasoning question that involves evaluating a conditional statement and its negation to infer a conclusion. \n\nFirst, let's break down the given information:\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This is a conditional statement where the presence of Mary at the wedding guarantees the presence of Sue.\n2. It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This is the negation of the second part of the conditional statement, implying that Sue's presence at the wedding is not guaranteed.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible scenarios:\n- If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there as well (from the conditional statement). However, we know that Sue's presence is not guaranteed, which creates a contradiction.\n- To avoid this contradiction, Mary cannot be at the wedding, because if she were, Sue would have to be there too (which contradicts the given information about Sue's presence not being guaranteed).\n\nAnswer: Yes, based on the given information, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding."
