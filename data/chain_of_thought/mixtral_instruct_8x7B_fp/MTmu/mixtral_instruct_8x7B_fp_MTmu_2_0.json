            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest' is a conditional statement, also known as a logical implication. It means that if the griffin was present in the forest, then the unicorn would also be present there.\n\nThe second statement 'It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest' is the negation of the consequent of the conditional statement. This implies that the unicorn was not necessarily in the forest, meaning it could have been somewhere else or not even exist.\n\nNow, since the conditional statement tells us that the presence of the griffin in the forest implies the presence of the unicorn, and we know that the unicorn was not in the forest, it follows that the griffin could not have been in the forest either.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
