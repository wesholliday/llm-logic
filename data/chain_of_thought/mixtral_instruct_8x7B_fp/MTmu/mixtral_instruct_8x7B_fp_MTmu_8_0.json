The original statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake\" can be restated as \"If the mummy is not awake, then the vampire is not awake\" (this is the contrapositive of the original statement and is logically equivalent to it).\n\nGiven that \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake\", we can infer that the mummy was not awake. Using our contrapositive statement, if the mummy is not awake, then the vampire is not awake. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"The vampire was not awake\".\n\nAnswer: Yes"
