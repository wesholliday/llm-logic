            "content": "Explanation: This question involves logical reasoning and the concept of conditional statements. The statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race\" is a conditional statement, often written as \"Alex finished the race\" -> \"Chris finished the race\". This statement means that if the condition (Alex finishing the race) is true, then the consequence (Chris finishing the race) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement, \"It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race,\" is denying the idea that Chris had to finish the race. In other words, it's possible that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nNow, let's think about the first statement. If the conditional statement \"Alex finished the race\" -> \"Chris finished the race\" is true, then the only way for \"It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race\" to be true is if \"Alex finished the race\" is false. This is because if Alex had finished the race, then Chris would have had to finish the race as well, but we're told that it's possible that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nTherefore, the only logical conclusion is that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
