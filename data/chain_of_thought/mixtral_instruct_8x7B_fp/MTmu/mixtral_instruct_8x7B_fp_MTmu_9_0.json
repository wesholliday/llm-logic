            "content": "Explanation: This question is a logical reasoning question that involves evaluating a conditional statement and its negation to infer a conclusion. \n\nThe conditional statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" can be written in logical notation as \"Lisa's purchase of the red shirt implies Mark's purchase of the blue shirt,\" or \"L -> M.\"\n\nThe negation of the statement \"Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" can be written as \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt,\" or \"not M.\"\n\nTo evaluate whether we can infer \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" (not L) from these two statements, we can use a technique called proof by contradiction. We assume the opposite of what we want to prove, which is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" (L), and see if we can derive a contradiction.\n\nIf Lisa bought the red shirt (L), then according to the conditional statement (L -> M), Mark must have bought the blue shirt (M). But this contradicts the given statement \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" (not M). Therefore, our assumption that Lisa bought the red shirt (L) must be false, and we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt (not L).\n\nAnswer: Yes."
