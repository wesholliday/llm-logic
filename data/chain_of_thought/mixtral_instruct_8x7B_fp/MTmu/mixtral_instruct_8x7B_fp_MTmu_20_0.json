            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow' is a conditional statement, also known as a logical if-then statement. It means that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the consequence (the banana being yellow) must also be true. \n\nThe statement 'It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow' means that the consequence of our conditional statement is false. Therefore, the condition must be false as well, because if the condition were true, the consequence would also have to be true.\n\nSo, if the condition (the apple being red) is false, then the original statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow' leads us to conclude that the banana did not have to be yellow.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
