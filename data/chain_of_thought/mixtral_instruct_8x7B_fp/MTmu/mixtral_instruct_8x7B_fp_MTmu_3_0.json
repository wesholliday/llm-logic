            "content": "Explanation: We are given the conditional statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\". This is also known as a material implication, where the truth of the statement depends only on the truth of its consequent (the book being a mystery novel) when its antecedent (the book being written by James) is true. \n\nFrom the second statement \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel\", we can infer that the book is not a mystery novel. Now, let's examine the possible cases:\n1. The book is written by James and is a mystery novel: This case is consistent with the first statement but contradicts the second statement.\n2. The book is written by James and is not a mystery novel: This case contradicts the first statement and is consistent with the second statement.\n3. The book is not written by James and is a mystery novel: This case is consistent with neither statement.\n4. The book is not written by James and is not a mystery novel: This case is consistent with both statements.\n\nSince cases 1 and 3 have been ruled out, only cases 2 and 4 remain. However, case 2 contradicts the second statement, so it must be rejected. Therefore, we are left with case 4, which is 'The book was not written by James'.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
