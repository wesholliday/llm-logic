            "content": "Explanation: This question involves logical reasoning using contrapositive and negation. The original statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside\" can be translated to \"If dog is inside, then not (cat is outside) is false\". This is equivalent to \"If not (cat is outside), then not (dog is inside)\". Given that \"It's not the case that the cat must have been outside\", we can infer \"The cat was not outside\". Using this information in our contrapositive statement, we get \"The dog was not inside\".\n\nAnswer: Yes"
