            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of logical reasoning using contrapositive method. The original statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den\" can be translated as \"Bear in cave implies Wolf in den\" or in logical symbols, P -> Q.\n\nThe negation of the second statement \"It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den\" is \"The wolf was not necessarily in the den\", or in logical symbols, ~Q.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement is \"If the wolf is not in the den, then the bear is not in the cave\", or in logical symbols, ~Q -> ~P.\n\nNow, if ~Q is true, then according to the contrapositive statement, ~P must also be true. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"The bear was not in the cave\".\n\nAnswer: Yes"
