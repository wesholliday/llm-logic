            "content": "Explanation: This question is a conditional statement where the initial statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\". This is a form of logical implication known as a conditional statement, where the first part (Tom watching football) is the antecedent and the second part (Jen watching basketball) is the consequent. \n\nThe second statement given is \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball\". This is a negation of the consequent of the initial conditional statement.\n\nThe question then asks if we can infer \"Tom did not watch football\" based on these two statements.\n\nTo answer this question, we can use a logical argument called contrapositive reasoning. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the antecedent and the consequent and then swapping their positions. In this case, the contrapositive of the initial statement would be \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\".\n\nGiven the second statement, \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball\", we can infer that Jen did not watch basketball. Therefore, using contrapositive reasoning, we can conclude that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
