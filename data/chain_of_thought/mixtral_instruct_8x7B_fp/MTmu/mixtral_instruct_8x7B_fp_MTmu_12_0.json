The given conditional statement is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical notation as:\n\nJ -> L\n\nThe negation of the statement \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" is given as \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo,\" which can be written in logical notation as:\n\n~L\n\nNow, let's analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. We have the conditional statement J -> L.\n2. We also have the negation of the consequent ~L.\n\nTo infer whether \"Joe did not go to the park\" (written as ~J), we need to examine the possible scenarios.\n\nScenario 1: If Joe went to the park (J), then according to the given conditional statement, Lucy must have gone to the zoo (L). However, this contradicts the negation of the consequent (~L). Therefore, Scenario 1 is impossible.\n\nScenario 2: If Joe did not go to the park (~J), then the conditional statement does not apply, and there is no information about whether Lucy went to the zoo or not.\n\nBased on our analysis, the only scenario that satisfies both the conditional statement and its negation is Scenario 2, where Joe did not go to the park (~J).\n\nAnswer: Yes"
