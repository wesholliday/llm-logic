This is a form of logical reasoning called modus ponens, where if the hypothesis is true, then the conclusion must be true.\n\nHowever, the question also states that \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis\", which contradicts the conclusion of the conditional statement. This means that the conditional statement cannot be true, and therefore, the hypothesis must be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"Jeff did not play basketball\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
