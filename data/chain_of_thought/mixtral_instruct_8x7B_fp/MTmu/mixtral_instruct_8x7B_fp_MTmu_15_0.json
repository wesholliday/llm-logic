If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. (Implicitly, if Erin didn't take a train, then Sam didn't take a plane.)\n2. It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train. (In other words, Erin could have taken some other mode of transportation or no transportation at all.)\n\nNow, let's analyze the given statements to draw a conclusion:\n- Since Erin didn't must have taken a train, it means that the condition for Sam taking a plane is not met.\n- Therefore, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
