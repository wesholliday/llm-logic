            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim' is a conditional statement, also known as a material implication. It tells us that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim, but it doesn't say anything about what happens if the shirt is not cotton.\n\nThe second statement 'It's not the case that the pants must have been denim' is the negation of the consequent of the original conditional statement. This means that the pants were not denim, but it doesn't tell us what the pants were made of.\n\nTogether, these two statements do not allow us to infer that the shirt was not cotton. The first statement only tells us what happens if the shirt is cotton, not what happens if it's not. The second statement tells us that the pants were not denim, but again, it doesn't tell us anything about the shirt.\n\nAnswer: No."
