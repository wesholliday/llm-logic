            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called denying the consequent, which is a valid form of logical reasoning. If the first premise is in the form \"If P, then Q\", the second premise negates the consequent Q, and the conclusion negates the antecedent P. In this case, P represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q represents \"Sue was at the wedding\". The argument follows the pattern:\n\nP -> Q (first premise)\n~Q (second premise)\n~P (conclusion)\n\nHere, the tilde (~) represents negation. If the first premise is true and the second premise denies the consequent of the first premise, then the antecedent must be false. Therefore, the conclusion \"Mary was not at the wedding\" is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
