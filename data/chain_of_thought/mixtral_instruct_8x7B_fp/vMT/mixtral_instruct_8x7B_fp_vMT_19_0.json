            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called transitive syllogism or hypothetical syllogism. It is valid when the truth of the first premise and the second premise would guarantee the truth of the conclusion. In this case, the argument can be represented as:\n\nPremise 1: If P, then Q\nPremise 2: Not Q\nConclusion: Not P\n\nIf the first premise is true (that is, if Tom watching football implies Jen watching basketball), and the second premise is true (that is, Jen did not watch basketball), then it necessarily follows that the conclusion must be true (that is, Tom did not watch football). This is because if Jen did not watch basketball, then the only way the first premise could be true is if Tom did not watch football.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
