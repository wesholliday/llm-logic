            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called modus tollens in classical logic. It states that if a conditional statement (p -> q) is true, then the negation of the consequent (not q) allows us to infer the negation of the antecedent (not p). In this case, the conditional statement is 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter'. The negation of the consequent is 'The robot did not visit Jupiter'. Therefore, according to modus tollens, we can infer the negation of the antecedent, which is 'The alien did not visit Mars'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
