            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called modus tollens, which is a valid form of deductive reasoning. The general structure of modus tollens is: if P, then Q; not Q; therefore, not P. In this case, the first premise 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis' can be restated as 'P implies Q'. The second premise 'Amy did not play tennis' can be restated as 'not Q'. Therefore, the conclusion 'Jeff did not play basketball' can be restated as 'not P'. Since the argument follows the structure of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
