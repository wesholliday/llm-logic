In this case, the first premise can be rephrased as \"A implies B\" (where A is 'the vampire was awake' and B is 'the mummy was awake'), and the second premise can be rephrased as \"not B\" (where not B is 'the mummy was not awake'). The conclusion is then 'the vampire was not awake', or 'not A'. Given the first premise and the second premise, the conclusion logically follows.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
