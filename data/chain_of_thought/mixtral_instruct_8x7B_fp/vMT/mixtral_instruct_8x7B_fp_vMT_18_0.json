            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as transitive syllogism or hypothetical syllogism. The argument is valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. In this case, the argument can be represented as:\n\nPremise 1: If P, then Q\nPremise 2: Not Q\nConclusion: Therefore, not P\n\nThis is a valid form of argument because if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. If the truck was not metal, then the first premise \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" implies that the doll cannot be plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid."
