            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called modus tollens, which is a valid form of deductive reasoning. The general structure of modus tollens is: if P, then Q; not Q; therefore, not P. In this case, P represents 'the griffin was in the forest' and Q represents 'the unicorn was in the forest'. The first premise states the conditional relationship between P and Q, the second premise negates Q, and the conclusion negates P. Since the argument follows the structure of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
