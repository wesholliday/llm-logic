            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called Denying the Antecedent, which is a fallacy in logic. The argument goes as follows:\n\n1. If Sue chose pizza (P), then Bob chose pasta (Q). This is the conditional statement or the 'if-then' statement.\n2. Bob did not choose pasta (not Q).\n3. Therefore, Sue did not choose pizza (not P).\n\nThe argument is invalid because even if the second premise is true (Bob did not choose pasta), it does not necessarily mean that the first premise is false (Sue did not choose pizza). There could be other reasons why Bob didn't choose pasta. The argument fails to consider other possible scenarios where Sue might have chosen pizza but Bob still didn't choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: No."
