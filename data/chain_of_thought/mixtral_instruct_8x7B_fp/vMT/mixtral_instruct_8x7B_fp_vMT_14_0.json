In this case, the first premise can be restated as 'P implies Q', where 'P' is 'the bear was in the cave' and 'Q' is 'the wolf was in the den'. The second premise is 'Q is false', which means 'the wolf was not in the den'. Therefore, according to the principle of transitive contradiction, the conclusion 'P is false', or 'the bear was not in the cave', must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
