If the first premise is a conditional statement (P -> Q), and the second premise negates the consequent (~Q), then the conclusion negates the antecedent (~P). In this case, the first premise is 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' (P -> Q), the second premise is 'Chris did not finish the race' (~Q), and the conclusion is 'Alex did not finish the race' (~P). Therefore, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
