            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as modus tollens in formal logic. The general structure of modus tollens is: if P, then Q; not Q; therefore, not P. In this case, the first premise can be rewritten as 'P: the book was written by James' and the second premise as 'not Q: the book is not a mystery novel'. Therefore, the argument follows the structure of modus tollens and is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
