            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is an example of a logically valid argument form called contrapositive. The argument 'If P, then Q' and 'not Q, therefore not P' is logically valid. In this case, 'Lisa bought the red shirt' is P and 'Mark bought the blue shirt' is Q. So, 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is the same as 'If P, then Q'. The second premise 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt' is 'not Q'. Therefore, the conclusion 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' is 'not P'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
