            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called modus tollens in logic, where the general form is \"If P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\" In this case, P represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q represents \"the pants were denim.\" The second premise \"the pants were not denim\" is the negation of Q. The conclusion \"the shirt was not cotton\" is the negation of P. Therefore, the argument follows the form of modus tollens and is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
