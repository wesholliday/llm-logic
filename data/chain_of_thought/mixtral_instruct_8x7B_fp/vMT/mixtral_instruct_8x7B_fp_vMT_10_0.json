            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called contrapositive reasoning, which is a type of logical reasoning that is based on the statement \"If P, then Q\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not Q, then not P\", which is logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nIn this argument, the first premise \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" can be written as \"If dog inside (P), then cat outside (Q)\". The second premise \"The cat was not outside\" can be written as \"not Q\". Therefore, the argument is in the form of \"If P, then Q; not Q; therefore, not P\".\n\nSince this argument follows the logical form of contrapositive reasoning, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
