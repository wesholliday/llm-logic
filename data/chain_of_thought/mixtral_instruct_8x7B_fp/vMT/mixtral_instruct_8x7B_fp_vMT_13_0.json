            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called modus tollens in logic, where the premises are in the form of \"If P, then Q\" and \"not Q\", which allows us to infer \"not P\". In this case, P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue\". Since the second premise states \"the truck was not blue\" (or \"not Q\"), we can infer \"the car was not red\" (or \"not P\"). Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
