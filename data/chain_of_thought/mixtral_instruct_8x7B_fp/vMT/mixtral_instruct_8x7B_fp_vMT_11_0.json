            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is an example of a hypothetical syllogism, which is a type of logical argument that involves two conditional statements and a conclusion that follows from them. In this case, the first premise is a conditional statement: 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry'. The second premise is also a conditional statement: 'The muffins were not blueberry'. The conclusion is derived from these two premises by negating the consequent of the first premise and making it the antecedent of the second premise. This is a valid form of argument because if the first premise is true and the second premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
