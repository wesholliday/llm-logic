The argument is structured as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If P, then Q\nPremise 2: Not Q\nConclusion: Therefore, not P\n\nHowever, this form of argument is not logically valid. If the first premise were instead \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" and the second premise were \"Kate did not eat salad,\" it would be more accurate to conclude \"Kate eating salad was not a result of Ben eating pasta,\" rather than \"Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\nAnswer: No."
