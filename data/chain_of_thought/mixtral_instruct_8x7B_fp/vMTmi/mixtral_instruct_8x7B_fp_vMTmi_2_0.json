            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as Modus Tollens in logic, where the general structure is \"If P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\" In this case, the first premise \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest\" can be rewritten as \"If griffin (G), then unicorn (U).\" The second premise \"The unicorn might not have been in the forest\" means that unicorn's presence is uncertain, which can be written as \"Possibly not U.\" This is logically equivalent to \"Not necessarily U.\" \n\nThe conclusion \"The griffin was not in the forest\" is \"Not G.\" \n\nGiven that the argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens and the second premise has been interpreted appropriately to fit this structure, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
