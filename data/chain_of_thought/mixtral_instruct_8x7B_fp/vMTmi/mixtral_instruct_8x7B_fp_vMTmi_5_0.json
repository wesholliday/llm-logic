            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called Denying the Antecedent, which is a fallacy in logic. The argument goes as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis)\n2. Not Q (Amy might not have played tennis)\n3. Therefore, not P (Jeff did not play basketball)\n\nThis is invalid because even if the second premise is true (Amy didn't play tennis), it doesn't necessarily mean that the first premise is false (Jeff could still have played basketball). The argument fails to consider the possibility that there could be other reasons why Amy didn't play tennis.\n\nAnswer: No."
