            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called modus tollens in logic, where the premises are 'If P, then Q' and 'not Q', leading to the conclusion 'not P'. In this case, 'P' represents 'the shirt was cotton' and 'Q' represents 'the pants were denim'. The first premise 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim' is 'P implies Q'. The second premise 'The pants might not have been denim' can be interpreted as 'not Q' or 'the pants were not denim'. Therefore, the conclusion 'The shirt was not cotton' or 'not P' follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
