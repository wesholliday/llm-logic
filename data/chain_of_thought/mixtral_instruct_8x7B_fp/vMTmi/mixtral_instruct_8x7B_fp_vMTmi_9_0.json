            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called Denying the Antecedent in formal logic, which makes it invalid. The argument assumes that if the second premise is true (Mark might not have bought the blue shirt), then the first premise must be false (Lisa did not buy the red shirt). However, this does not logically follow. The truth of the second premise does not necessarily negate the truth of the first premise. Even if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, Lisa could still have bought the red shirt. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No."
