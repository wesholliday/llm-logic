The argument assumes that if the second premise is true (Chris might not have finished the race), then the first premise must be false (If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race). However, the truth of the second premise does not necessarily negate the truth of the first premise. It could be the case that both Alex and Chris finished the race, or that neither of them did. The argument fails to consider these possibilities.\n\nAnswer: No."
