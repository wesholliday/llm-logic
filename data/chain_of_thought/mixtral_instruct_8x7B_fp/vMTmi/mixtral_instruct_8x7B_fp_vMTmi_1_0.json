            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is known as denying the antecedent, which is a fallacy in logic. The argument assumes that if the second premise is true (Sue might not have been at the wedding), then the first premise must be false (Mary was not at the wedding). However, the first premise only states that if Mary was at the wedding, Sue had to be there too. It does not exclude the possibility that both Mary and Sue were not at the wedding. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No."
