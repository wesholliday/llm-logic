            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called modus tollens in logic, where the general form is \"If P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\" In this case, the first premise \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\" can be rewritten as \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\" The second premise \"The book might not be a mystery novel\" implies that the book is not definitely a mystery novel, or that it is possible that the book is not a mystery novel. This can be rewritten as \"Not Q.\" Therefore, using modus tollens, we can validly infer \"Not P,\" which is \"The book was not written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes."
