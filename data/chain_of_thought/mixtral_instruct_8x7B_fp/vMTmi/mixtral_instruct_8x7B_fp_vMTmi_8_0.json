In this case, P represents 'the vampire was awake' and Q represents 'the mummy must have been awake.' The second premise 'The mummy might not have been awake' is equivalent to 'It is not the case that the mummy was awake.' This allows us to infer 'The vampire was not awake' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
