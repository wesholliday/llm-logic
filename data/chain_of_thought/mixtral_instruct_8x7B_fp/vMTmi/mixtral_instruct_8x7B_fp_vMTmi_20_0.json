            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called Denying the Antecedent, which is a fallacy in logic. The argument assumes that if the second premise (the banana might not have been yellow) is true, then the first premise (if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow) cannot be true. However, the truth of the second premise does not necessarily negate the first premise. Even if the banana might not have been yellow, the apple could still have been red. The argument fails to consider the possibility that the apple could be red regardless of the color of the banana. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No."
