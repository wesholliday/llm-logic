            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called modus tollens in classical logic. The general form is \"If P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\" In this case, the premises can be translated as \"If the car was red (P), then the truck must have been blue (Q)\" and \"The truck might not have been blue (not Q)\". From these premises, we can infer that the car was not red (not P). This is because if the car had been red, the truck would have been blue, but since the truck might not have been blue, the car could not have been red.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
