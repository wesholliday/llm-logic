            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called Denying the Antecedent in formal logic. The argument goes as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If P, then Q (If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal)\nPremise 2: Not Q (The truck might not have been metal)\nConclusion: Therefore, not P (The doll was not plastic)\n\nHowever, this argument is not logically valid. According to the rules of logic, denying the antecedent (P) does not necessarily mean that the consequent (Q) is also denied. In this case, even if the truck was not metal, it doesn't mean that the doll couldn't have been plastic. There could be other reasons why the truck was not metal, unrelated to the material of the doll.\n\nAnswer: No."
