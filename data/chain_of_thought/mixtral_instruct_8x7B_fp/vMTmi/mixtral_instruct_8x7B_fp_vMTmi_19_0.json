The argument assumes that if the second premise is true (Jen might not have watched basketball), then the first premise must be false (Tom did not watch football). However, this is not necessarily the case. It's possible that Tom watched football and Jen still didn't watch basketball, which would mean the first premise is true and the conclusion is false. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No."
