            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called Denying the Antecedent, which is a fallacy in logic. The argument assumes that if the consequence is false, then the initial condition must be false as well. However, this is not necessarily true. The second premise only states that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo, not that she definitely didn't. Therefore, even if Lucy didn't go to the zoo, it doesn't definitively mean that Joe didn't go to the park. There could be other reasons why Lucy didn't go to the zoo. \n\nAnswer: No."
