            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The team might win the game\" implies that there is a possibility that the team wins. However, it does not explicitly rule out the possibility of the team losing. In a typical context, a game can have two main outcomes: win or lose. Therefore, when we say that the team might win, it can be inferred that there is a chance they might not win, which includes losing the game. Hence, the statement \"The team might win the game or lose\" can be inferred from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
