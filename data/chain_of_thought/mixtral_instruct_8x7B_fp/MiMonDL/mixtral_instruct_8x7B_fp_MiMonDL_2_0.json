The statement \"The book might be on the shelf or in the library\" is expanding the possible locations of the book to include both the shelf and the library. Since the original statement does not exclude the possibility of the book being in the library, it is reasonable to infer that the book might be on the shelf or in the library.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
