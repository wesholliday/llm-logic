            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The computer might be broken\" is an assertion that there is a possibility the computer is not functioning correctly. When considering the possibility of it being broken or working, it's important to remember that a statement in the form \"A or B\" can be true even if only one of the conditions is true. In this case, \"The computer might be broken or working\" suggests that the computer could be in either state.\n\nSince the original statement only discusses the possibility of the computer being broken and does not rule out the possibility of it working, the expanded statement \"The computer might be broken or working\" is a more inclusive representation of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
