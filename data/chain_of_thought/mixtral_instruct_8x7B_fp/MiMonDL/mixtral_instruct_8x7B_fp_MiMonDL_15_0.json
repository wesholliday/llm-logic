When we consider the possibility of the student passing the exam, we also need to take into account the other possible outcome, which is the student failing the exam. The statement \"The student might pass the exam or fail\" is a more comprehensive description of the possible outcomes, as it includes both passing and failing scenarios. Therefore, the first statement can be inferred to mean the same thing as the second statement, as it encompasses the idea of the student's potential success or failure.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
