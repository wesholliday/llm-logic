'The weather might be sunny or rainy' is a more inclusive statement that encompasses both potential outcomes. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The weather might be sunny or rainy' directly from 'The weather might be sunny' because the latter does not explicitly mention the possibility of rain.\n\nAnswer: No."
