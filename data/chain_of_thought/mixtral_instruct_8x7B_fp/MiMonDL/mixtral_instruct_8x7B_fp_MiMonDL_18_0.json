When we consider the possibility \"The restaurant might be open or closed,\" we are acknowledging two possibilities: that the restaurant is open and that it is closed. The original statement only acknowledges one possibility, so it does not allow us to infer the disjunction \"The restaurant might be open or closed.\"\n\nAnswer: No."
