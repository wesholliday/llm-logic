The statement does not exclude the possibility of the envelope being in other locations, but it also does not explicitly include the possibility of the envelope being upstairs. Therefore, we cannot directly infer from the given statement that \"The envelope might be under a bed or upstairs\". However, if we have additional information suggesting that the only possible locations for the envelope to be, upstairs or under a bed, then we could make that inference.\n\nAnswer: No."
