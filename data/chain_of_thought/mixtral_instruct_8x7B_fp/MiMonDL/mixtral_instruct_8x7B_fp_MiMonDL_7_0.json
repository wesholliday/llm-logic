When we consider the possibility of it being \"on time,\" this addition represents an alternative outcome to the situation. By including this possibility, we expand the scope of potential outcomes to include both \"late\" and \"on time.\" Therefore, the original statement can be inferred to include the possibility of the train being late or on time.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
