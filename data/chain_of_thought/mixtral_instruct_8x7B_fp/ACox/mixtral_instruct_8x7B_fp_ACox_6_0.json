It tells us that if the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink. However, it does not explicitly state that the grommet was indeed sploffed.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the grommet was sploffed, we need to check if the first statement, \"The grommet plopped the frink,\" can lead us to that conclusion. Unfortunately, this statement only tells us that the grommet plopped the frink, but it does not provide any information about the grommet's state before plopping the frink.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The grommet was sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: No."
