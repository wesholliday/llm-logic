We know that 'The fribble was crinked' is a given fact.\n2. We also know that 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble was crinked'. This statement tells us that if the fribble had been snurgled, it would have been crinkled.\n3. However, we are not told that the fribble was only crinkled if it was snurgled. It could be that there are other ways for the fribble to become crinkled.\n4. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer 'The fribble was snurgled'.\n\nAnswer: No."
