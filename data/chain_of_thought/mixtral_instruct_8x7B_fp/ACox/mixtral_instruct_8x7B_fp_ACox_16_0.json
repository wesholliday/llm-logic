It does not assert that the condition is actually true.\n\nFrom this statement, we cannot infer that the grommet was actually sploffed, only that if it was, then it was also plopped. The sentence 'The grommet was plopped' also doesn't tell us anything about whether or not the grommet was sploffed, only that it was plopped.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that 'The grommet was sploffed'.\n\nAnswer: No."
