            "content": "Explanation: This question is a formal representation of a logical argument, often called a syllogism. The given syllogism is:\n\nMajor premise: If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\nMinor premise: The splat quanked.\nConclusion: Therefore, the splat was morphed.\n\nTo determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises, we can use the rules of inference in logic. In this case, we are given a conditional statement (if-then) in the major premise and a statement of fact in the minor premise. The argument follows a form of logical reasoning called modus ponens, where if the antecedent (the 'if' part) is true, then the consequent (the 'then' part) must also be true.\n\nIn the given syllogism, the minor premise states that the splat quanked. If the major premise is true, then this implies that the splat was morphed. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
