            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called a hypothetical syllogism. It has the structure: if P, then Q; P; therefore, Q. In this case, P is 'the book was written by James' and Q is 'the book is a mystery novel'. The first premise gives us the conditional relationship between P and Q, and the second premise asserts that P is true. From these two premises, the conclusion follows logically that Q (the book is a mystery novel) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
