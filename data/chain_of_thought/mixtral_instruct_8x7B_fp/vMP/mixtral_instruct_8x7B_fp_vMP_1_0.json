            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called a modus ponens argument, where the first premise is a conditional statement (if P, then Q), the second premise affirms the antecedent of the conditional statement (P), and the conclusion asserts the consequent of the conditional statement (Q). In this case, the first premise is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', the second premise is 'Mary was at the wedding', and the conclusion is 'Sue was at the wedding'. Since the argument follows the structure of modus ponens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
