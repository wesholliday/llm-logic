            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called a modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. The argument is valid if and only if the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. In this case, the argument is valid because if the first premise 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest' is true, and the second premise 'The griffin was in the forest' is also true, then it must be the case that 'The unicorn was in the forest'. This is because the first premise establishes a conditional relationship between the griffin's presence in the forest and the unicorn's presence in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
