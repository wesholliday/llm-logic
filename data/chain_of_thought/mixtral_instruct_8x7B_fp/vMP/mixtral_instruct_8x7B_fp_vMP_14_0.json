            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called a hypothetical syllogism. It's structure is: If P, then Q; P; therefore, Q. In this case, P represents 'the bear was in the cave' and Q represents 'the wolf was in the den'. The first premise gives us the conditional relationship between the bear's location and the wolf's location. The second premise states that the condition stated in the first premise is true. Therefore, based on this information, it logically follows that Q (the wolf was in the den) must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
