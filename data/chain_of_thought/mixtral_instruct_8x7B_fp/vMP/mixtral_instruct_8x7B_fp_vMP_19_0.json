            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called a hypothetical syllogism. It's structured with two conditional statements (if-then sentences) as premises, from which a conclusion is drawn. In this case, the first premise is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'. The second premise is 'Tom watched football'. \n\nGiven these two premises, the argument concludes 'Jen watched basketball'. This follows the pattern of hypothetical syllogism where if the first premise is true (i.e., if A implies B), and the second premise is also true (i.e., A is true), then the conclusion must be true (i.e., B is true). \n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
