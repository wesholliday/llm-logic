            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called a hypothetical syllogism. It's structure is: if P, then Q; P; therefore, Q. In this case, P is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and Q is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. The first premise gives us the conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. The second premise states that the condition has been met, namely, Lisa did buy the red shirt. Therefore, based on the hypothetical syllogism, we can infer that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
