            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is an example of a hypothetical syllogism, which is a valid form of argument in deductive logic. A hypothetical syllogism consists of two conditional statements (if-then statements) and a conclusion that follows logically from those two conditionals. In this case, the first premise is a conditional statement that states 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry'. The second premise is another conditional statement that asserts 'The cake was chocolate'. Given these two premises, the conclusion that 'The muffins were blueberry' necessarily follows. This is because if the cake being chocolate implies that the muffins were blueberry, and the cake was indeed chocolate, then it must be the case that the muffins were blueberry. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
