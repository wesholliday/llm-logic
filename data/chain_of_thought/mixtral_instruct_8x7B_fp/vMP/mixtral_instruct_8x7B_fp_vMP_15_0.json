In this case, P is 'Sam took a plane' and Q is 'Erin took a train'. The first premise gives us the conditional relationship between Sam's action and Erin's action. The second premise states that the condition stated in the first premise is true. Therefore, based on this information, it logically follows that Erin took a train.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
