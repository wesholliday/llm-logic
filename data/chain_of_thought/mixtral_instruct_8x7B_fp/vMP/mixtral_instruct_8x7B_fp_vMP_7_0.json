In this case, P is 'Alex finished the race' and Q is 'Chris finished the race'. The first premise gives us the conditional statement 'if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race'. The second premise tells us that Alex did indeed finish the race. Given these two premises, the conclusion that Chris finished the race logically follows.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
