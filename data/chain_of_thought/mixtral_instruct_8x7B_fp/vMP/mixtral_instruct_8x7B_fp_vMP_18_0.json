            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called modus ponens, which has the general form 'If P, then Q; P; therefore Q.' In this case, P is 'the doll was plastic' and Q is 'the truck was metal.' Given the first premise 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' and the second premise 'the doll was plastic,' it follows logically that 'the truck was metal.' This is because the first premise establishes a conditional relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal, and the second premise affirms the antecedent of that conditional statement. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
