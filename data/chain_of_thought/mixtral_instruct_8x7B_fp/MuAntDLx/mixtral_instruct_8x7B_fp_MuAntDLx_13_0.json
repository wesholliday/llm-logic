However, it does not explicitly state that the fribble cannot be in both or that it cannot be in some other state. Nonetheless, if we are to make a logical inference based solely on the information given, we can only conclude that the fribble is in one of those two states, but not specifically that it must be in plimp and not flim.\n\nAnswer: No."
