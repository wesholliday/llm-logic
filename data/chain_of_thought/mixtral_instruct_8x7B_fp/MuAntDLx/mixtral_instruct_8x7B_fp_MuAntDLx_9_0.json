In this case, the component statements are 'The floob must be wobble' and 'The floob must be on wozzle'.\n\nHowever, just because one of the statements must be true, it doesn't necessarily mean that the other statement must also be true. It's possible that the second statement 'The floob must be on wozzle' is the one that must be true, in which case the first statement 'The floob must be wobble' could still be false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The floob must be wobble' based on the given statement 'The floob must be wobble or on wozzle'.\n\nAnswer: No."
