In this case, the options are 'quibble flump' or 'flimble frozz'. To infer 'The frazzle must be quibble flump' from this statement, we would need some additional information that rules out the possibility of the frazzle being 'flimble frozz'. Without such information, we can't definitively make that inference.\n\nAnswer: No."
