The condition is \"The wump is quank on zibber or wobble for quank quork,\" and the conclusion is \"The wump must be quank on zibber.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer the conclusion from the condition, we need to consider the logical structure of the statement. In this case, the statement is a disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid form of argument in logic. A disjunctive syllogism is an argument that has the following form:\n\nP or Q\nNot Q\nTherefore, P\n\nIn this case, the condition \"The wump is quank on zibber or wobble for quank quork\" can be broken down into \"The wump is quank on zibber\" (P) or \"The wump wobbles for quank quork\" (Q). The conclusion \"The wump must be quank on zibber\" is equivalent to \"The wump is quank on zibber\" (P). The second part of the condition is \"not Q,\" since it states that the wump must wobble for quank quork.\n\nTherefore, since the statement is a valid disjunctive syllogism, we can infer the conclusion \"The wump must be quank on zibber\" from the condition \"The wump is quank on zibber or wobble for quank quork.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes."
