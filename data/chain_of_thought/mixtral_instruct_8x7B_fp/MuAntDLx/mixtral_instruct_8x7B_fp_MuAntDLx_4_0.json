The two component statements are \"The quorple must be at grooble frazzle\" and \"The quorple must be at snork.\"\n\nIf we are to infer that \"The quorple must be at grooble frazzle\" is true, then the original statement does not require \"The quorple must be at snork\" to be true. It's possible that the quorple must be at both grooble frazzle and snork, but the original statement does not explicitly state this requirement.\n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide any information that would exclude the possibility of the quorple being at grooble frazzle. Thus, while the information provided does not definitively establish that the quorple must be at grooble frazzle, it also does not contradict that possibility.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
