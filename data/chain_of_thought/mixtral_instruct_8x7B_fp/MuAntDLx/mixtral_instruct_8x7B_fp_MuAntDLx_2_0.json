It suggests that either the first condition (flump on plonk) is true, or the second condition (flump in glorp) is true, or both could be true.\n\nHowever, this statement does not allow us to infer that 'The flump must be on the plonk'. It could be the case, but it could also be that the flump is in the glorp. The original statement does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the flump is on the plonk.\n\nAnswer: No."
