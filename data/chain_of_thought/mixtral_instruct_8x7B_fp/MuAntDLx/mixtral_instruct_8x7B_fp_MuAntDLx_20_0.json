In this case, the two statements are \"The gribble must be flim\" and \"The gribble must be bimboozle\". \n\nIn a disjunction, if at least one of the two statements is true, then the whole statement is true. However, we cannot infer that \"The gribble must be flim\" is true just from the information given. It could be true, but it could also be false, and the statement \"The gribble must be bimboozle\" could be true instead. Without further information, we cannot determine which of the two statements is true.\n\nAnswer: No."
