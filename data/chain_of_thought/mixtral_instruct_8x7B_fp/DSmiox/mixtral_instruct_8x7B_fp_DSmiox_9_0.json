It doesn't exclude the possibility of both happening, but since we know from the first statement that the twonk might not be plinked, it suggests that it could be varnished.\n\nHowever, the information provided does not definitively confirm that 'The twonk is varnished'. It only suggests this as a possibility. The statements do not negate the possibility of the twonk being plinked at a later time or having some other disposition that doesn't require plinking.\n\nAnswer: No."
