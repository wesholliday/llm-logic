The second statement \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spended\" presents two possibilities: either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spent. If the dreb is not spent (as suggested by the first statement), then the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the dreb is vroombed. Therefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that \"The dreb is vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes."
