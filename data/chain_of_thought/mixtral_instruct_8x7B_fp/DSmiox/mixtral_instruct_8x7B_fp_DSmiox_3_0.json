This statement introduces a level of uncertainty about the quanking of the splat.\n\n2. \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked\" which presents two possibilities: either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked. \n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that if the splat might not be quanked (as per statement 1), then the only remaining possibility from statement 2 is that \"the splat is morphed\". \n\nAnswer: Yes."
