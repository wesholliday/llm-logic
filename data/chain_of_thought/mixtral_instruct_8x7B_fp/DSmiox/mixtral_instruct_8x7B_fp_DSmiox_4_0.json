This means that it's possible for the fribble not to be crinkled, which can also be interpreted as 'The fribble may be uncrinkled'.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinkled\". This is a disjunctive statement, meaning one or the other condition must be true. \n\nGiven these two statements, if the fribble might not be crinkled (as per the first statement), then the second part of the second statement (\"it must be crinkled\") cannot be true. Therefore, the first part of the second statement must be true, which is \"the fribble is snurgled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that 'The fribble is snurgled'."
