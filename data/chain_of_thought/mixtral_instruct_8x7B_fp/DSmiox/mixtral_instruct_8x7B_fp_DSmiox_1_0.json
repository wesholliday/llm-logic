In this case, the first part of the disjunction is 'The flugel is blimmed'.\n\nSince we know that it is possible for the flugel not to be zargled, it is possible for the second part of the disjunction 'it must be zargled' to be false. If the second part is false, then the first part 'The flugel is blimmed' must be true in order for the entire disjunction to be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The flugel is blimmed'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
