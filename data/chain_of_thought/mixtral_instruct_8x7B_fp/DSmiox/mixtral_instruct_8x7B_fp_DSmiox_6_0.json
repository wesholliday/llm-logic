This statement suggests that the grommet not being plopped is a possibility, but it doesn't exclude the possibility of the grommet being plopped.\n\n2. The second statement is 'Either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped.' This statement means that the grommet being sploffed and the grommet being plopped are the only two possibilities.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot infer that 'The grommet is sploffed.' This is because the first statement tells us that the grommet might not be plopped, but it doesn't exclude the possibility of the grommet being plopped. Since the grommet being plopped is still a possibility, we cannot definitively say that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: No."
