This statement implies that there is a possibility that the flug is not zimmed, which means it could be unzimmed or blummed.\n2. Either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed. This statement presents two possibilities: either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed (not possibly unzimmed).\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the flug could be blummed or unzimmed. But the second statement rules out the possibility of the flug being unzimmed. Therefore, if the flug is not zimmed, then it must be blummed.\n\nSince we are given the first statement, which tells us that there is a possibility that the flug is not zimmed, we can infer based on the second statement that the flug must be blummed.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
