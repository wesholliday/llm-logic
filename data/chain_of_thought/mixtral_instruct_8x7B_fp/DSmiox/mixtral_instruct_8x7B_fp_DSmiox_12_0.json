The second statement \"Either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped\" presents two possibilities: either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped. However, the first statement already tells us that there is a possibility that the smip is not lupped. Therefore, the second statement does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: No."
