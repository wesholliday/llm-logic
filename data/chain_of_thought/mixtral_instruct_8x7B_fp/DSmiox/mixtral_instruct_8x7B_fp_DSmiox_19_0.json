It does not rule out the possibility that the smonk could be plagged, but it also does not guarantee that it is plagged.\n\nThe second statement \"Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged\" presents two possibilities for the smonk: it is vreebled or it must be plagged. If the smonk is not plagged, then it must be vreebled.\n\nGiven these two statements, if the smonk might not be plagged, then it could be vreebled instead. Therefore, we can infer that \"The smonk is vreebled\" is a possibility.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that \"The smonk is vreebled\" is a possibility."
