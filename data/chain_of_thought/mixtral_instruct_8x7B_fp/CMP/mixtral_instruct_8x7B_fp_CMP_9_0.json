    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it\u2019s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be. Moreover, it\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: The information given states that apples are likely to be the top-selling fruit, followed closely by bananas, and oranges are trailing distantly behind. This implies that if apples aren't the top-seller, then the top position is more likely to be taken by bananas, as they are the second most popular fruit. The only way oranges would become the top-seller is if both apples and bananas had significantly less sales than expected. Therefore, while it's possible for oranges to be the top-selling fruit if apples aren't, it's not the most likely scenario.\n\nAnswer: Yes, it is likely that if apples aren't the top-selling fruit, oranges will be, but it's not the most likely scenario. Bananas are more likely to be the top-seller if apples aren't."
