    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Ford, Toyota, and Honda lead US auto sales. Industry analysis expects Ford will sell the most vehicles this year, followed closely by Toyota, with Honda lagging significantly behind. These brands lead the market, so if Toyota isn\u2019t #1 in sales, then if Ford isn\u2019t, Honda will be. Moreover, Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Ford doesn\u2019t lead in sales, Honda will?",

            "content": "Explanation: The key to this question is understanding the relationships between the three brands' sales and how they compare to each other. According to the information given, Ford is expected to sell the most vehicles, Toyota is expected to sell the second most, and Honda is expected to sell significantly less than both Ford and Toyota. If Ford doesn't lead in sales, then it's possible that Toyota could have higher sales, but since Toyota is expected to have the second most sales, it's unlikely that they will have a significant enough increase to make up the difference between their expected sales and Ford's expected sales. Therefore, if Ford doesn't lead in sales, it's more likely that Honda would be the brand to have the highest sales.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
