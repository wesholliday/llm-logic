    "user_prompt": "Suppose that spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons. Forecasts show it's likely most vacations this year will happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with many fewer happening in the winter. These are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. Moreover, spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": "Explanation: The information given states that spring is the most popular travel season, followed closely by summer, and then there are significantly fewer vacations in winter. It also states that if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then winter will. The question asks if, given that spring doesn't have the most vacations, it follows that it's likely that winter will.\n\nHowever, the information provided does not give any indication of how likely it is that winter will have the most vacations if summer doesn't. It only states that if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then winter will. It's possible that even if spring has the most vacations, winter could still have more vacations than summer, but we don't have enough information to determine the likelihood of this scenario.\n\nAnswer: No."
