    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don\u2019t increase the most, then if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won\u2019t increase the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

            "content": "Explanation: The statement is structured as a conditional: \"if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.\" However, this conclusion is based on the assumption that if rents don't increase the most, then home prices will increase the most. This assumption is given in the scenario, but it's important to note that this is still an assumption. \n\nThe statement also mentions that mortgage rates are expected to rise the least among the three. \n\nGiven these points, if rents don't increase the most and home prices increase the most instead, then yes, mortgage rates will increase the most in this case. However, if home prices also don't increase the most, then the statement's assumption is not met and we can't conclude that mortgage rates will increase the most. \n\nAnswer: Yes, but only under the assumption that if rents don't increase the most, then home prices will increase the most."
