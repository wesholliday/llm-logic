    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians are the leading political parties. Based on recent polling, the Democrats likely will gain the most new voters, followed by Republicans, with Libertarians trailing distantly. These are the only major parties, so if Republicans don\u2019t gain the most voters, then if Democrats don\u2019t, Libertarians will. Moreover, Democrats likely will gain the most voters and hence Republicans likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will?",

The validity of the argument depends on the truth of the premises, which are not provided in this case. But even if the premises were true, the argument would still be fallacious. Here's why:\n\nIf Democrats don't gain the most voters, it doesn't necessarily mean that Libertarians will gain the most voters. It's possible that neither Democrats nor Libertarians will gain the most voters, and some other party will instead. Therefore, we cannot conclude that it's likely that Libertarians will gain the most voters if Democrats don't.\n\nAnswer: No."
