    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the Lakers, Warriors, and Celtics have the best odds to win the NBA championship. Based on expert projections, it is most likely the Lakers will win, followed closely by the Warriors, with the Celtics having much lower odds. These are the only top contenders, so if the Warriors don\u2019t win, then if the Lakers don\u2019t win, the Celtics will win. Moreover, it is most likely the Lakers will win and hence that the Warriors won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the Lakers don\u2019t win, the Celtics will?",

It also tells us that if the Warriors don't win, and the Lakers don't win either, then the Celtics will win. \n\nHowever, the information does not provide any specific details about the likelihood of the Celtics winning if the Lakers don't win. It only tells us that the Celtics have lower odds than the Lakers and Warriors, but it doesn't say that they have a high likelihood of winning if the Lakers don't win.\n\nAnswer: No."
