    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": "Explanation: The argument is structured as follows: \n\n1. Coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers.\n2. If coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then tea is also unlikely to retain the most morning drinkers (because coffee and tea are the two major morning drinks).\n3. If tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then soda will retain the most morning drinkers (since coffee, tea, and soda are the only major morning drinks).\n\nFrom these premises, the conclusion is drawn that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nThe argument is valid in the sense that the conclusion follows logically from the premises. However, the argument's strength depends on the reliability of the market research and the assumption that there are no other significant morning drinks besides coffee, tea, and soda.\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is valid, and if we accept the premises as true, then it's likely that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers."
