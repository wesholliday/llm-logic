    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options in a city. According to ridership data, Uber likely will have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. These are the only major transportation providers, so if Lyft doesn\u2019t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. Moreover, Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won\u2019t give the most rides. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will?",

            "content": "Explanation: The passage states that Uber is likely to have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, and then there are significantly fewer rides for taxis. It also mentions that if Lyft doesn't give the most rides, then taxis will have the most rides. Given that Uber is likely to have the most rides, it means Lyft is unlikely to have the most rides. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is likely that if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
