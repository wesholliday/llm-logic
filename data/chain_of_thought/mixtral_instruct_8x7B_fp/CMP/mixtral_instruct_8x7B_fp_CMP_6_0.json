    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, and Beyonce have the top-selling albums this year. Industry experts project it's likely Taylor Swift's album will sell the most copies, followed closely by Bad Bunny's, with Beyonce's album far behind. These are the only top-sellers, so if Bad Bunny\u2019s album doesn\u2019t sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift\u2019s doesn\u2019t, Beyonce\u2019s will. Moreover, Taylor Swift\u2019s likely will sell the most and hence Bad Bunny's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else.

            "content": "Explanation: The information given states that Taylor Swift's album is projected to sell the most copies, followed closely by Bad Bunny's, and then Beyonce's is far behind. This means that Bad Bunny's album sales are expected to be less than Taylor Swift's but more than Beyonce's. If Taylor Swift's album doesn't sell the most copies, it can only be surpassed by Bad Bunny's album, as Beyonce's is far behind. Therefore, it's not likely that if Taylor Swift's album doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will.\n\nAnswer: No."
