    "user_prompt": "Suppose that banana bread, chocolate chip cookies, and carrot cake are the most popular baked goods. According to a consumer survey, it is very likely that banana bread will be the top seller, followed closely by chocolate chip cookies, with carrot cake far behind. These are the only top sellers, so if chocolate chip cookies aren\u2019t the top seller, then if banana bread isn\u2019t, carrot cake will be. Moreover, it is likely banana bread will be top and hence that chocolate chip cookies won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if banana bread isn\u2019t the top seller, carrot cake will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: The key to this question is understanding that there are only three options for the top seller and that banana bread is the most likely to be the top seller. If banana bread isn't the top seller, then there are only two options left: chocolate chip cookies and carrot cake. We are also told that if banana bread isn't the top seller, then chocolate chip cookies are unlikely to be the top seller. Therefore, it is more likely that carrot cake will be the top seller if banana bread isn't.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
