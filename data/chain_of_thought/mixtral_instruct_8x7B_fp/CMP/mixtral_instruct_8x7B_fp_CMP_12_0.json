Publishing data indicates thrillers will likely be the #1 genre this year, followed closely by romances, with mysteries far behind. These genres lead the market, so if romances aren\u2019t #1, then if thrillers aren\u2019t, mysteries will be. Moreover, thrillers likely will lead sales and hence romances likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if thrillers aren\u2019t #1, mysteries will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: The passage states that thrillers are expected to be the best-selling genre this year, followed by romances, with mysteries significantly behind. It also mentions that if romances aren't the top-selling genre, then mysteries will be second. However, the passage also states that thrillers are likely to lead sales, implying that they will be the number one genre. Therefore, even if romances aren't the second-highest selling genre, it doesn't necessarily mean that mysteries will be. It's still likely that thrillers will be the best-selling genre.\n\nAnswer: No."
