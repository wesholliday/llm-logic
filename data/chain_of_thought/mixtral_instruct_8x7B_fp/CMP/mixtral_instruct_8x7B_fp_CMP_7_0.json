    "user_prompt": "Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it\u2019s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn\u2019t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn\u2019t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": "Explanation: The information given states that if solar power doesn't generate the most electricity, then wind power will. It also states that tidal power is likely to generate the most electricity, which implies that it's unlikely for solar power to generate the most electricity. However, the information does not provide any direct relationship between tidal power and wind power. Even if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, it doesn't necessarily mean that wind power will. There could be a scenario where solar power generates the second most electricity, and wind power still lags behind. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that it's likely that if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will.\nAnswer: No."
