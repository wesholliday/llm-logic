    "user_prompt": "Suppose that India, China, and Russia are the world's leading emerging economies. Economists project it's likely India's economy will grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind. These are by far the biggest emerging economies, so if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn\u2019t, Russia will be. Moreover, India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if India isn\u2019t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: The initial information tells us that India's economy is projected to grow the fastest this year, followed by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind. This means that if India isn't the top-growing emerging economy, then China's economy must have a higher growth rate than Russia's. However, the passage also states that China's growth rate is likely to be lower than India's. Therefore, even if India isn't the top-growing emerging economy, China's growth rate will still be higher than Russia's. Thus, the statement does not follow.\n\nAnswer: No."
