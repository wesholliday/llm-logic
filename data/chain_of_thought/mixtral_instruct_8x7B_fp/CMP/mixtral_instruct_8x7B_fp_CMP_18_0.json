    "user_prompt": "Suppose that pizza, burgers, and tacos are the most frequently ordered takeout foods. According to restaurant data, pizza likely will be the top takeout item ordered, followed by burgers, with tacos ordered much less frequently. These foods lead takeout orders, so if burgers aren\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn\u2019t, tacos will be. Moreover, pizza likely will lead takeout orders and hence burgers likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if pizza isn\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: The information given states that pizza is the most likely top takeout item, followed by burgers, and then tacos. If burgers aren't the top takeout item, it doesn't necessarily mean that tacos will be. It could be the case that pizza still leads the takeout orders. However, since tacos are ordered much less frequently than pizza and burgers, if neither pizza nor burgers are the top takeout item, then it's reasonable to assume that tacos would be the next in line. But this doesn't mean it's likely, just that it could be a possibility.\n\nAnswer: It doesn't necessarily follow that it's likely that, if pizza isn't the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be."
