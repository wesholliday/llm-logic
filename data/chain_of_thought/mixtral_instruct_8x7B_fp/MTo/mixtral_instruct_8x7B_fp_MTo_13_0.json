This statement tells us that the truck's color is something other than blue.\n2. If the car was red, then the truck was blue. This statement is a conditional statement, which means it only applies under certain conditions - in this case, when the car is red.\n\nNow, let's think about whether the car could be red or not, based on these statements:\n- If the car were red, then the truck would have to be blue, according to the second statement.\n- However, we know from the first statement that the truck is not blue.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible for the car to be red, because if it were, the truck would have to be blue, which contradicts the information given in the first statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
