If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the result (Amy playing tennis) must also be true.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot directly infer that 'Jeff did not play basketball'. The given facts only tell us that Amy didn't play tennis, but they don't provide any information about whether Jeff played basketball or not. It's possible that Jeff played basketball and the condition for the second statement was satisfied, but Amy still chose not to play tennis for some other reason. So, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively say that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: No."
