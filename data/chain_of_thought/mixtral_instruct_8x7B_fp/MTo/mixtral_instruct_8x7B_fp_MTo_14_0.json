Second, we have the conditional statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\".\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The bear was not in the cave\", we need to consider whether the truth of the first statement and the conditional statement together imply the truth of the second statement.\n\nIn this case, the second statement is a conditional statement. If the condition (the bear being in the cave) is not met, then the statement as a whole is true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent (the wolf being in the den).\n\nGiven that the wolf was not in the den, the condition of the second statement is not met, so the second statement is true, and thus we can indeed infer \"The bear was not in the cave\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
