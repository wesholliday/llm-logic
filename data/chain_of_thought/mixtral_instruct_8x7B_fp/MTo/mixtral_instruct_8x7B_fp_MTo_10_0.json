This means that the cat could be somewhere else, possibly inside the house. \n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\". This implies that if the condition (the dog being inside) is true, then the consequence (the cat being outside) must also be true.\n\nHowever, since we know from the first statement that the cat was not outside, the condition stated in the second statement cannot be true. Therefore, the dog must have been somewhere other than inside, because if it were inside, it would contradict the information we have about the cat's location.\n\nAnswer: No."
