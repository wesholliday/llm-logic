            "content": "Explanation: Let's analyze the given statements one by one. \n\n1. 'Lucy did not go to the zoo' tells us that Lucy is not at the zoo.\n2. The second statement 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' is a conditional statement, also known as an 'if-then' statement. It tells us that if Joe went to the park, then as a result, Lucy would go to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's think about the scenario where 'Joe did not go to the park'. If Joe didn't go to the park, then the condition for Lucy to go to the zoo hasn't been met. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot say for certain that Lucy would have gone to the zoo.\n\nSince we cannot definitively say that Lucy went to the zoo, it is possible that Joe did not go to the park. This is because the conditional statement only links going to the park (Joe) with going to the zoo (Lucy), and does not make any claims about what happens if Joe doesn't go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
