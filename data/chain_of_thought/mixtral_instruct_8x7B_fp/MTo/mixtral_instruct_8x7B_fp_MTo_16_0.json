If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the pants are not denim. \n\nNow let's look at statement 2. It's a conditional statement where the condition is \"the shirt was cotton.\" The consequence of this condition is \"the pants were denim.\" But we already know from statement 1 that the pants are not denim.\n\nThis means that the condition stated in 2 cannot be true because if it were, then according to 2, the pants would have to be denim, which contradicts what we know from statement 1. Therefore, the negation of the condition must be true, which is \"the shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes"
