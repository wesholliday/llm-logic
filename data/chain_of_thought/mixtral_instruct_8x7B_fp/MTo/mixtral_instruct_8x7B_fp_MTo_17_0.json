Second, we have an conditional statement: if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad. \n\nTo use this conditional statement to infer something about Ben, we need to think about its contrapositive, which is: if Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta. \n\nThis contrapositive follows logically from the original statement because it's based on the same truth relationship. Given that our first piece of information matches the condition in the contrapositive, we can indeed infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
