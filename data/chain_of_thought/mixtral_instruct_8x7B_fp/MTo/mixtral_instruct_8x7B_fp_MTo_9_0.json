            "content": "Explanation: Let's analyze the given statements one by one. \n\n1. 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt' tells us that Mark did not purchase the blue shirt.\n2. 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement. If the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the result (Mark buying the blue shirt) follows.\n\nNow, we want to find out if we can infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' based on these statements. To do this, let's consider the two possible scenarios for Lisa:\n\na) Lisa bought the red shirt: According to the second statement, if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark should have bought the blue shirt. However, this contradicts the first statement, which says Mark did not buy the blue shirt. Therefore, this scenario is impossible.\n\nb) Lisa did not buy the red shirt: In this case, since she didn't buy the red shirt, the condition of the second statement is false. Therefore, we cannot determine if Mark bought the blue shirt or not based on the second statement alone. But more importantly, this scenario does not contradict any of the given statements.\n\nSince only scenario (b) is possible without contradicting any of the given statements, we can indeed infer that 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
