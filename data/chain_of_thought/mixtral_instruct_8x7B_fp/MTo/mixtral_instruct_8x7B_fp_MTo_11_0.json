If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. This is a conditional statement, often referred to as \"if-then\" statement. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'The cake was not chocolate', we need to consider the truth of this statement in light of the given information. If the muffins are not blueberry, then the condition of the second statement is false. And according to the rules of logic, a false condition makes the entire conditional statement false, regardless of the truth value of its consequence.\n\nTherefore, the truth of 'The muffins were not blueberry' does not necessitate 'The cake was not chocolate'. Both scenarios - the cake being chocolate or not - could be possible or impossible together with the fact that the muffins are not blueberry.\n\nAnswer: No."
