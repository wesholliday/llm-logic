It doesn't provide any information about the apple.\n\n2. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. This is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the result (the banana being yellow) must also be true.\n\nNow let's think about the possibility of the apple being red. If the apple were red, then according to the second statement, the banana should be yellow. However, we know from the first statement that the banana is not yellow. Therefore, the condition in the second statement cannot be true, which implies that the apple cannot be red.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
