If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball (we can write this as T -> ~J)\n\nWe want to find out if we can infer that Tom did not watch football (~T).\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that if Tom watched football (T), then Jen would have watched basketball (~J). However, we already know from the first statement that Jen did not watch basketball (~J). Therefore, it contradicts the assumption that Tom watched football (T).\n\nTo avoid this contradiction, we must conclude that Tom did not watch football (~T).\n\nAnswer: Yes"
