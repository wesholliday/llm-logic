The second statement is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\". \n\nNow, let's think about what the second statement means. It tells us that if Alex did finish the race, then as a consequence, Chris also finished the race. However, it does not say anything about what happens if Alex does not finish the race. \n\nGiven the first statement, we know that Chris did not finish the race. This means that even if Alex had finished the race, the second statement would be false because Chris did not finish. But since we have no information about whether Alex finished or not, we cannot make a definitive statement about Alex.\n\nAnswer: No."
