First, we know that \"Erin did not take a train.\" Second, we have the conditional statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer that \"Sam did not take a plane,\" we need to examine the truth values of these statements. \n\nThe first statement is a fact, so its truth value is true (T). \n\nFor the second statement to be true, both conditions must be met: Sam took a plane and Erin took a train. However, we already know that Erin did not take a train, which contradicts the second part of the second statement. Therefore, the whole conditional statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is false (F).\n\nNow, let's examine the possible scenarios based on these two statements:\n1. If Sam took a plane, he would contradict the given information about Erin. This scenario is impossible because it leads to a contradiction.\n2. If Sam did not take a plane, the condition for the second statement is not met, so its truth value is already false (F). In this case, not taking a plane for Sam does not contradict any given information.\n\nSince the second statement is false, it does not necessarily mean that Sam did not take a plane. However, since there is no contradiction when assuming Sam did not take a plane, this scenario is more plausible.\n\nAnswer: We cannot definitively infer that \"Sam did not take a plane,\" but we also cannot disprove it based on the given information."
