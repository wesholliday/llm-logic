If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nTo infer 'The alien did not visit Mars', we would need a connection between the alien's visit to Mars and the robot's visit to Jupiter. The second statement provides this conditional connection.\n\nHowever, even if the robot didn't visit Jupiter, it doesn't necessarily mean that the alien didn't visit Mars. There could be other reasons why the robot didn't go to Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: No."
