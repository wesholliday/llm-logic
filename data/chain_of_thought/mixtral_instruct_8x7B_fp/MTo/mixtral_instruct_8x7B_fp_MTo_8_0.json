The second statement is a conditional statement, 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake'. \n\nFrom the second statement, if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would also be awake. But the first statement tells us that the mummy was not awake. Therefore, the vampire cannot be awake, because if the vampire were awake, then the mummy would also be awake, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that 'The vampire was not awake'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
