The second statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement, also known as a hypothetical syllogism. It means that if Mary had been present at the wedding, then Sue would have also been present.\n\nHowever, the given information only states that Sue was not at the wedding, without providing any details about Mary's presence or absence. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive conclusion about Mary's attendance based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No."
