The unicorn was not in the forest (this is statement A).\n2. We have a conditional statement: If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest (this is statement B, which can be rewritten as B: the griffin in the forest \u2192 unicorn in the forest).\n\nWe want to find out if the griffin was not in the forest (not-griffin in the forest). To do this, let's use the contrapositive of statement B, which is: not-unicorn in the forest \u2192 not-griffin in the forest.\n\nGiven statement A (unicorn not in the forest), we can use the contrapositive of statement B to conclude that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
