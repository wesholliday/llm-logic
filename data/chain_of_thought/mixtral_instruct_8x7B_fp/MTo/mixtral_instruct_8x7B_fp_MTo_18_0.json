If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nFrom the second statement, we can infer that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. But we know from the first statement that the truck is not metal. Therefore, it follows that the doll cannot be plastic.\n\nThis is a form of logical reasoning called transitive inference, where if A implies B and B implies C, then A implies C.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
