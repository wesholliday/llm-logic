This is not a definitive statement that Sue did not choose pizza, but it suggests that it's possible.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza' is a negation of the necessity for Sue to have chosen pizza. This statement is true as long as it's possible that Sue did not choose pizza, regardless of whether she actually did or not.\n\nSince the statement 'Sue might not have chosen pizza' suggests that it's possible that Sue did not choose pizza, we can infer that 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza' is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
