It's not definitively saying that the shoes are not in the closet, but it's implying a possibility that they could be somewhere else. \n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet\" is a more abstract way of saying that it's possible the shoes are not in the closet. It's negating the necessity or requirement for the shoes to be in the closet.\n\nThese two statements are expressing similar ideas, but they're not exactly the same. However, they both convey the idea that there's a possibility the shoes are not in the closet. Therefore, while not logically equivalent, they are consistent with each other and allow us to infer one from the other.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
