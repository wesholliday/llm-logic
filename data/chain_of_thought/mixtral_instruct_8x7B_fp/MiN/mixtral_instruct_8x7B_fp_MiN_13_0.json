            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The toy might not be in the toy box\" implies that there is a possibility or chance that the toy is not in its designated place, the toy box. On the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" means that it's possible or there is a chance that the toy is not in the toy box. Both statements convey the same idea, which is the uncertainty of the toy's location, specifically whether it is in the toy box or not. Therefore, we can infer one statement from the other.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
