On the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" is denying the necessity or certainty of Mary's presence at the wedding. \n\nThese two statements are logically equivalent because both express the same idea - that it is not required or certain that Mary attended the wedding. The first statement acknowledges a possibility of her absence, while the second statement negates the assumption of her presence.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
