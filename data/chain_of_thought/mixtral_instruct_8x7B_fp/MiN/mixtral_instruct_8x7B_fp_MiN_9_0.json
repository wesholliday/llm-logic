            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\" implies that there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. On the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" is denying the necessity or certainty of Lisa buying the red shirt. These two statements are logically equivalent because both are expressing the same idea - that it is not certain that Lisa bought the red shirt. The first statement is acknowledging the possibility of Lisa not buying the red shirt, while the second statement is denying the necessity of Lisa buying the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
