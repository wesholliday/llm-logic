This is similar to the statement \"It's possible that the griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\" means that it's not necessary that the griffin was in the forest, or in other words, there is a possibility that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nSince both statements convey the same meaning, we can infer that \"The griffin might not have been in the forest\" implies \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes."
