It does not definitively state that the notebook is not in the drawer, but rather that it's possible that it's not.\n\nHowever, this statement still allows for the possibility that the notebook is in fact in some other location, not just the drawer. Therefore, while \"the notebook might not be in the drawer\" weakens the assumption that the notebook is in the drawer, it does not completely negate it.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from \"the notebook might not be in the drawer\" that \"it's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer\".\n\nAnswer: No."
