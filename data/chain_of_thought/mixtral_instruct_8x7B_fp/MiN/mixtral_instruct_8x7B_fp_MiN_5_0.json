This is not the same as saying that it's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball. However, it does not rule out the possibility that Jeff did not play basketball either. The original statement does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that Jeff did play basketball at some point.\n\nAnswer: Yes, because the original statement 'Jeff might not have played basketball' implies that there is a possibility that Jeff did not play basketball, which means it's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball."
