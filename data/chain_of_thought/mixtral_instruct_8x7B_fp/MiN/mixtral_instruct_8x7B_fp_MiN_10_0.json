This implies that it is not certain that the dog was inside, and there is a chance that the dog was outside. \n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the dog must have been inside\" means that it is not necessary that the dog was inside. This statement is equivalent to saying that there is a possibility that the dog was not inside.\n\nSince both statements convey the same meaning, we can infer that \"The dog might not have been inside\" implies \"It's not the case that the dog must have been inside.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes."
