            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The milk might not be on the counter\" is negating the certainty of the milk's presence on the counter, suggesting that it could be elsewhere or not present at all. This aligns with the logical negation of the statement \"the milk must be on the counter\", which asserts that it is not necessarily the case that the milk is on the counter. Therefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter' from 'The milk might not be on the counter'.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
