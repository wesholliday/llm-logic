This is similar to the statement \"It's possible that the sunglasses are not in her bag.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag\" means that it is not necessary or certain that the sunglasses are in her bag. Instead, there is a possibility that they are not in her bag.\n\nSince both statements convey the same idea, that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not in her bag, we can infer one from the other.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
