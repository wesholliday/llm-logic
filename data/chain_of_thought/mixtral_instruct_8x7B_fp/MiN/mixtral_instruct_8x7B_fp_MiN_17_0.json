On the other hand, the statement \"It's not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack\" is equivalent to saying \"The scarf does not have to be in my backpack\" or \"It's possible that the scarf is not in my backpack.\" These two statements convey the same idea, that there is a possibility that the scarf is not in the backpack. Therefore, we can infer one statement from the other.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
