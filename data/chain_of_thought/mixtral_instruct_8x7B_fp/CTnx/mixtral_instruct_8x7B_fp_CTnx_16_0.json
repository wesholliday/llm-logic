It is logically equivalent to the statement \"If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\" This is because the negation of \"the sneg was crampled\" is \"the sneg was not crampled,\" and the negation of \"the sneg did not sprotet the frink\" is \"the sneg sprotet the frink.\" Therefore, the given statement implies the desired statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
