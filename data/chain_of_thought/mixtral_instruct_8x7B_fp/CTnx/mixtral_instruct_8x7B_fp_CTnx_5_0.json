The converse would be 'If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was fraggled'. However, the original statement tells us that if the zinger is fraggled, then it cannot be smoogled. \n\nTherefore, the converse 'If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was fraggled' is not necessarily true, because the original statement already established that a fraggled zinger cannot be smoogled.\n\nAnswer: No."
