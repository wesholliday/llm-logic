The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. If the original statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled' is true, then its contrapositive 'If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked' will also be true, because they are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
