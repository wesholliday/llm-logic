            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled\" is in the form of a contrapositive. It means that blimming and zargling are mutually exclusive events - if one occurs, the other cannot. \n\nIf we want to infer \"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed\", we need to form a contrapositive again. The original statement tells us that not zargled follows from blimmed. So, if we negate both events, we should get \"If the flugel was not blimmed, then the flugel was zargled\". However, this is not what we were asked to infer. We were asked to infer the opposite - \"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed\".\n\nHowever, this conclusion can be drawn because of the mutual exclusivity of blimming and zargling established by the original statement. If zargling implies non-blimming (which it does based on the original statement), then it must also be true that non-zargling implies blimming. But since the original statement tells us that blimming and zargling are mutually exclusive, it means that if zargling is true, blimming must be false. Hence, we can indeed infer 'If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed'.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
