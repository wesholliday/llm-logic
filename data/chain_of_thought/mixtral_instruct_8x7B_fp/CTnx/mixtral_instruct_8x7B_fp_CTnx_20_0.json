The converse would be \"If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was bluttered.\"\n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide enough information to determine if the converse is true. It only tells us what happens when the fleeg is bluttered, not when it surns. Therefore, we cannot infer that the converse is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No."
