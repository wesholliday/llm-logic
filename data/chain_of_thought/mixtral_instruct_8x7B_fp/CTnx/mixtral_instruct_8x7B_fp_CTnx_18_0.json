The original statement is \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was not nugged.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\"\n\nIn logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa. This is because they are just different ways of expressing the same logical relationship.\n\nTherefore, if the original statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was not nugged\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
