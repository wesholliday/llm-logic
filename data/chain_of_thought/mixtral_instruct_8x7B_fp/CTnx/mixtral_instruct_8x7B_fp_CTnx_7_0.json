The converse would be \"If the whiffle tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\". \n\nTo determine if this statement is true, we need to consider the possible meanings of \"shanked\" and \"tink\". If \"shanked\" means that the whiffle was hit poorly and \"tink\" means that the whiffle made a clear ringing sound, then it is possible that the converse is true. However, without further context or information about the meanings of these words, we cannot be certain.\n\nAnswer: Based on the given information, we cannot definitively say whether or not the converse is true."
