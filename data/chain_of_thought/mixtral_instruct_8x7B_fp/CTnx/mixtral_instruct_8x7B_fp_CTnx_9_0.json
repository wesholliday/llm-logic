The negation of Q (~Q) represents \"it was not varnished\". \n\nWe want to determine if the converse of this statement is true, which would be written as: Q -> ~P. \n\nHowever, just because the original statement is true, it does not mean that its converse must also be true. In fact, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true, even if the original statement is true.\n\nTo test whether the converse is true, we would need additional information or evidence that supports it. In this case, we only have the original statement, so we cannot definitively say whether or not the converse is true.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'If the twonk was varnished, then the twonk was not plinked' based solely on the given statement 'If the twonk was plinked, then it was not varnished'."
