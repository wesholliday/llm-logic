It is logically equivalent to the statement \"If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\" This is because the negation of \"the grommet was sploffed\" is \"the grommet was not sploffed,\" and the negation of \"the grommet plopped the frink\" is \"the grommet did not plop the frink.\" Therefore, the given statement and the desired statement are logically equivalent and can be inferred from one another.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
