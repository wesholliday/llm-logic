It is logically equivalent to the statement \"If the fribble did crink, then the fribble was not snurgled.\" This is because the negation of \"the fribble was snurgled\" is \"the fribble was not snurgled,\" and the negation of \"the fribble did not crink\" is \"the fribble did crink.\" Therefore, the given statement implies the desired conclusion.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
