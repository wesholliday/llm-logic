The converse would be \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was vreebled\". \n\nHowever, the original statement tells us that if a smonk was vreebled, it did not plag. This means that even if a smonk plagged, it doesn't necessarily mean it was vreebled before, because vreebling and plagging are separate conditions that don't depend on each other.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled' from the given statement?\" is no.\n\nAnswer: No."
