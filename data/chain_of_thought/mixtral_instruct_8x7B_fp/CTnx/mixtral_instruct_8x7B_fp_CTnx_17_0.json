            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical inference and specifically about the validity of a particular logical argument. The argument in question is a form of contrapositive, which is a statement that has the opposite conclusion and opposite hypothesis of a given conditional statement. The original statement is \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob did not movated.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the flob movated, then the flob was not skizzled.\"\n\nTo determine if the contrapositive is valid, we can use the concept of logical equivalence. Two statements are logically equivalent if they have the same truth value for all possible combinations of truth values of their component statements. In other words, if two statements are logically equivalent, then they are either both true or both false under the same conditions.\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa. Therefore, we can infer \"If the flob movated, then the flob was not skizzled\" from \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob did not movated.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes."
