The hypothesis is \"the splat was morphed\" and the conclusion is \"the splat did not quank\". \n\nTo determine if the converse of this statement is true, we switch the hypothesis and the conclusion. The converse would be \"If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed\". \n\nIn general, the truth of a statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse. However, in this case, the statement and its converse are logically equivalent, meaning if one is true, then the other must also be true, and vice versa. This is because the original statement is a negation of the converse. \n\nAnswer: Yes."
