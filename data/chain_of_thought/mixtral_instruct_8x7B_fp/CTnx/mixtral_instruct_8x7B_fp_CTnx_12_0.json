It can be rewritten as \"If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was not shripped\" which is also a contrapositive. \n\nTo determine if the second statement can be inferred from the first, we need to check if they are logically equivalent. Two statements are logically equivalent if they have the same truth value in all possible circumstances. In this case, both statements are in the form of contrapositives, so they are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
