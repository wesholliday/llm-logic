The converse would be \"If the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was flooped\". \n\nHowever, the original statement \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint\" implies that the two events (flooping and bimming the zoint) are mutually exclusive - they cannot happen at the same time. Therefore, the converse \"If the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was flooped\" cannot be true, because if the wug is bimming the zoint, it cannot be flooped at the same time.\n\nAnswer: No."
