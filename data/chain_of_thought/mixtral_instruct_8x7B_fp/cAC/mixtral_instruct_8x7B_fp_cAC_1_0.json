            "content": "Explanation: This is a logical reasoning question that involves evaluating a conditional statement and applying it to given information. The conditional statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is also known as a material implication. It tells us that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) is also true.\n\nThe second piece of information provided is 'Sue was at the wedding'. This is a simple statement, not a conditional one.\n\nTo determine if we can conclude 'Mary was at the wedding', we need to consider whether the given information satisfies the condition of our conditional statement. In other words, does the fact that 'Sue was at the wedding' mean that 'Mary was at the wedding'?\n\nLooking at our conditional statement, we see that it only tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, Sue would be too. However, it does not tell us anything about the reverse scenario - it doesn't say that if Sue is at the wedding, then Mary must be there as well.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and our conditional statement, we cannot definitively conclude that 'Mary was at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer: No."
