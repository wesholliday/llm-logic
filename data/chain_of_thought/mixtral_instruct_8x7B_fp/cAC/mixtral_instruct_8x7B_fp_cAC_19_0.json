This is also known as a material implication where the truth of the whole statement is dependent on the truth of its constituent parts. The statement is only false when the hypothesis is true but the conclusion is false. \n\nGiven the statement 'Jen watched basketball', we cannot definitively conclude that 'Tom watched football'. This is because even if the second part of the conditional statement is true, the first part could be true or false. The truth of 'Jen watched basketball' does not necessarily imply the truth of 'Tom watched football'. \n\nAnswer: No."
