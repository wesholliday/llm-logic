            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical reasoning question using conditional statements. The original statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is in the form of a conditional statement P -> Q, where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue\". \n\nThe second statement given is \"The truck was blue\", which is the consequence (Q) of our original conditional statement. \n\nHowever, even if the consequence is true, it does not necessarily mean that the condition (P) is also true. This is because of the nature of \"if-then\" statements: if the condition is false, the whole statement can still be true. \n\nIn this case, the fact that the truck is blue does not guarantee that the car being red was the only possibility. Perhaps the car was some other color, and the truck happened to be blue regardless. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that 'The car was red'.\n\nAnswer: No."
