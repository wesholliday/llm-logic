            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical reasoning principle known as modus ponens, which states that if \"P implies Q\" and P is true, then Q must also be true. In this case, the statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" is equivalent to \"P implies Q,\" where P is \"the griffin was in the forest\" and Q is \"the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\nThe second statement, \"The unicorn was in the forest,\" is equivalent to Q being true. Therefore, if both \"P implies Q\" and Q are true, then P must also be true. In this case, P is \"the griffin was in the forest,\" so we can conclude that the griffin was indeed in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
