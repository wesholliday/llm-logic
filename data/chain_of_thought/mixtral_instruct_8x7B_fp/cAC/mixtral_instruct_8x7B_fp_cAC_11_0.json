In this case, we have two statements:\n\n1. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. (If P, then Q)\n2. The muffins were blueberry. (Q)\n\nWe want to determine if we can validly conclude that the cake was chocolate. (P)\n\nTo do this, we need to see if the given statements fit into a valid form of argument. The given statements match the form of a hypothetical syllogism, which is as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Q\n-----------------\n3. P\n\nThe validity of this argument form can be understood by considering the truth table for conditionals (if-then statements). If the conditional statement (If P, then Q) is true, and the consequent (Q) is also true, then the antecedent (P) must be true as well.\n\nApplying this to our given statements, if \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is true, and \"The muffins were blueberry\" is true, then it follows that \"The cake was chocolate\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
