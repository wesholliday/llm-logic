            "content": "Explanation: This statement is an application of logical reasoning, specifically modus ponens. Modus ponens is a rule of inference that allows one to infer a conclusion from two propositions when the first proposition (if p then q) is a conditional statement, and the second proposition (p) is the antecedent of the conditional statement. If both propositions are true, then the conclusion (q) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the first proposition is 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake', and the second proposition is 'The mummy was awake'. The first proposition is a conditional statement, and the second proposition matches the antecedent of the conditional statement. Therefore, we can apply modus ponens and infer the conclusion 'The vampire was awake'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
