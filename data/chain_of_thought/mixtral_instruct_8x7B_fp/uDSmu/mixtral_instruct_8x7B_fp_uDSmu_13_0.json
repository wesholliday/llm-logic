We are also told that it's not the case that the toy must be on the bookshelf, which means that the toy being on the bookshelf is not a certainty. \n\nFrom this information, we can infer that the toy is likely in the toy box. This is because if the toy being on the bookshelf is not a certainty, then the only remaining possibility, with certainty, is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
