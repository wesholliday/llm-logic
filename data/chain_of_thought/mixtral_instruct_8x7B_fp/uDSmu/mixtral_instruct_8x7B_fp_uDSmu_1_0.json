The second statement rules out the possibility that Fido must be in the garden (meaning it's not necessary for Fido to be there). Since the only other possibility given is that Fido is inside, and we know Fido can't be forced to be in the garden, it follows logically that Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
