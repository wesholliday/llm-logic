However, we are told that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head, which means that the sunglasses could be in her bag or they could be somewhere else entirely (not just perched on her head). Since we cannot exclude the possibility that the sunglasses are in her bag, and there is no information suggesting they are elsewhere, we can infer that the sunglasses could be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
