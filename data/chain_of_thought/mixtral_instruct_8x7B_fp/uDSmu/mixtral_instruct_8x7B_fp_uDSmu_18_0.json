We are also told that it is not necessarily on the nightstand, which means that the notebook could still be on the nightstand, but it does not have to be. However, since there are no other options or information given, and because the notebook must be somewhere, if it's not on the nightstand, then it must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
