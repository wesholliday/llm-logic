We are also told that it's not necessary that the umbrella is tucked away in the closet. This information implies that the umbrella being in the car is a possibility, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the umbrella is in the car. However, since there are no other options given, and the umbrella being in the car is a possibility, we can infer that the umbrella might be in the car.\nAnswer: Yes."
