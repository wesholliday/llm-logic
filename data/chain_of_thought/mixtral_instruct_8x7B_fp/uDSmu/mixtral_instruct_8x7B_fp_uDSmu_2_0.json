However, the negation of the second statement, \"it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table,\" indicates that the book is not necessarily required to be on the table. This does not exclude the possibility that the book could be on the table, but it does mean that we cannot infer for certain that the book is on the shelf based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No."
