We also know that it's not necessarily the case that the keys are dangling in the cabinet. This information doesn't rule out the possibility that the keys could be in the drawer. Since there's no other option given for the keys' location, we can infer that the keys are indeed in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
