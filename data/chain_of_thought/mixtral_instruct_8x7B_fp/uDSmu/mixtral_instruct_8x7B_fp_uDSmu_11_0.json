We are also told that it's not the case that the newspaper must be on the porch, meaning that the newspaper could still be somewhere else. However, since we only have two options and one of them has been ruled out, the other option must be true. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the newspaper is in the driveway.\nAnswer: Yes."
