We are then told that it is not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom. This negative information eliminates one of the original possibilities, leaving us with only one option for the cat's location.\n\nSince the cat cannot be playing in the bedroom, it must be napping on the couch. The given information allows us to make this deduction with certainty.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
