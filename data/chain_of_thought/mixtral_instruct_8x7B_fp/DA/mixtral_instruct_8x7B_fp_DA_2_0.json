            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical reasoning problem that can be solved using rules of inference, specifically Modus Tollens. The given statement 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest' is a conditional statement, often denoted as P -> Q. The second statement 'The griffin was not in the forest' is the negation of P, denoted as ~P. According to Modus Tollens, if P -> Q is true and ~P is true, then we can infer that ~Q is also true. In this case, P is 'The griffin was in the forest', Q is 'The unicorn was in the forest', ~P is 'The griffin was not in the forest', and ~Q is 'The unicorn was not in the forest'. Since both P -> Q and ~P are true, we can infer that ~Q is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
