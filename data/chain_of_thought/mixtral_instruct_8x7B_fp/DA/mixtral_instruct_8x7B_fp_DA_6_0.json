The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This can be represented as \"Sue (choosing pizza) -> Bob (choosing pasta)\". The second statement is \"Sue did not choose pizza\". \n\nNow, let's think about what the first statement means in terms of Bob's choice. It says that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. However, it doesn't say that Bob will only choose pasta when Sue chooses pizza. It's possible that Bob could still choose pasta even if Sue didn't choose pizza.\n\nThe second statement tells us that Sue did not choose pizza. Given this information, we cannot definitively say what Bob chose because the first statement only tells us that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta, not that Bob will only choose pasta under all circumstances.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer 'Bob did not choose pasta'.\n\nAnswer: No."
