            "content": "Explanation: This question is a test of logical reasoning, specifically using the concept of contrapositive. The original statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement, where the apple's color (red) is the hypothesis and the banana's color (yellow) is the conclusion.\n\nThe negation of the hypothesis \"The apple was not red\" does not necessarily mean that the negation of the conclusion \"The banana was not yellow\" is true. This is because there could be other reasons for the banana not being yellow.\n\nHowever, if we form the contrapositive of the original statement, it would be \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\". Given that the apple was not red, the contrapositive would hold true, and thus we can infer that the banana was not yellow. But this is not the correct way to approach this problem because we are not given that the contrapositive is true.\n\nAnswer: No. The given information does not allow us to infer that the banana was not yellow."
