The original statement is in the form of \"If A, then B\". Here, A represents \"the dog was inside\" and B represents \"the cat was outside\".\n2. We are given another piece of information: \"The dog was not inside\", which negates statement A.\n3. However, the given statements do not provide any direct or indirect information about the cat's location other than when the dog is inside.\n4. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot infer that 'The cat was not outside'.\n\nAnswer: No."
