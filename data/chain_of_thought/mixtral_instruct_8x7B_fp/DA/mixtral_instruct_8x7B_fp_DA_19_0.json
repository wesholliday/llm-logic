            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical reasoning question using transitive inference. The original statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is in the form of a conditional statement, often referred to as a logical implication. The second statement \"Tom did not watch football\" is a denial of the original conditional statement's hypothesis. \n\nHowever, the original conditional statement does not necessarily mean that Jen will only watch basketball if Tom watches football. It's possible that Jen could watch basketball regardless of whether Tom watches football or not. \n\nAnswer: No. We cannot infer 'Jen did not watch basketball' based on the given statements. The statements only tell us that Tom did not watch football, but they do not provide enough information to determine whether Jen watched basketball or not."
