            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of logical reasoning using transitive properties. The statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is a conditional statement, specifically a type of implication known as a hypothetical syllogism. \n\nThe second statement 'The vampire was not awake' is a negation of the antecedent from the first statement. \n\nGiven these two statements, we can indeed infer 'The mummy was not awake'. This is because if the condition (the vampire being awake) is false, then the consequence (the mummy being awake) must also be false.\n\nThis is a form of logical reasoning called modus tollens, which states: if p implies q, and not-p is true, then not-q must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
