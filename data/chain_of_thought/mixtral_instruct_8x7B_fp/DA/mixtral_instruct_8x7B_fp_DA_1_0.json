            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical reasoning, specifically whether we can make a certain conclusion based on the given information. The given information consists of two statements:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n2. Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nTo determine if we can conclude that Sue was not at the wedding, we need to think about the logical relationship between the two statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement. It tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding.\n\nThe second statement tells us that Mary was not at the wedding. To determine if Sue was also not at the wedding, we need to consider what the first statement tells us about the relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence.\n\nIn this case, the first statement tells us that if Mary was present, then Sue was also present. It does not tell us anything about what happens if Mary is not present. Therefore, we cannot use the first statement to infer that Sue was not present if Mary was not present.\n\nAnswer: No."
