            "content": "Explanation: This question involves logical reasoning using conditional statements.  The original statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" can be translated into logical notation as: \n\n(1) James wrote the book -> The book is a mystery novel\n\nThe second statement \"The book was not written by James\" means:\n\n(2) ~(James wrote the book)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer:\n\n(3) The book is not a mystery novel, or in logical notation: ~(The book is a mystery novel)\n\nFrom (1) and (2), we can infer (3) using the concept of contrapositive in logic. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing the order. The contrapositive of (1) is:\n\n(4) ~(The book is a mystery novel) -> ~(James wrote the book)\n\nSince (2) is ~(James wrote the book), and (4) tells us that ~(The book is a mystery novel) follows from this, we can indeed infer (3) - The book is not a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
