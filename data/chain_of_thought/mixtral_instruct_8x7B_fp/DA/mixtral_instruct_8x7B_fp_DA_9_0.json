            "content": "Explanation: This is a logical reasoning question that follows the structure of a conditional statement, or \"if-then\" statement. The first sentence, \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is the conditional statement. The second sentence, \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" is the given fact. \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\", we need to consider the truth values of the given fact in relation to the conditional statement. \n\nIn the conditional statement, if Lisa buys the red shirt, then Mark buys the blue shirt. However, the given fact is that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Therefore, the condition of the conditional statement is not met. \n\nIn logic, if the condition of a conditional statement is not met, then the statement as a whole is considered to be true. However, in this case, we are not simply looking for the truth value of the conditional statement, but rather trying to determine if we can infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nSince the condition of the conditional statement is not met, we cannot make any conclusions about what Mark did or did not buy. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\".\n\nAnswer: No."
