            "content": "Explanation: This is a contrapositive reasoning problem. The original statement is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,\" which can be written as \"Shirt is cotton -> Pants are denim.\" Its contrapositive is \"Not (Pants are denim) -> Not (Shirt is cotton),\" or \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nGiven that the shirt was not cotton, we can infer that if the pants were denim, then the shirt would not be cotton, which contradicts the given information that the shirt was not cotton. Therefore, the pants cannot be denim.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
