            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument in the form of a conditional statement, often called a \"hypothetical syllogism\" in formal logic. The first sentence, \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den,\" is the conditional statement, also known as a hypothetical. The second sentence, \"The bear was not in the cave,\" is the denial of the hypothesis.\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'The wolf was not in the den', we need to examine if the truth of the hypothesis is necessary for the truth of the conclusion in the original conditional statement. In this case, the conditional statement 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den' implies that the wolf's presence in the den is contingent upon the bear being in the cave. However, the second sentence denies the presence of the bear in the cave.\n\nSince the wolf's presence in the den is contingent upon the bear being in the cave, and the bear is not in the cave, it is reasonable to infer that the wolf is also not in the den.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
