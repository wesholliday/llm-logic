            "content": "Explanation: This question involves logical reasoning, specifically using transitive inference. The original statement 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. This statement means that if the condition (the cake being chocolate) is true, then the consequence (the muffins being blueberry) must also be true.\n\nHowever, the second statement 'The cake was not chocolate' negates the condition of the first statement. Since the condition is false, the truth of the consequence cannot be determined solely based on the given information.\n\nIn other words, just because the cake was not chocolate, it doesn't necessarily mean that the muffins weren't blueberry. There could be other reasons why the muffins weren't blueberry. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The muffins were not blueberry' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No."
