            "content": "Explanation: The initial statement \"The movie must have been in English\" implies that the movie was spoken in the English language. However, it does not explicitly state whether or not the movie was subtitled. If the movie was in English but also had subtitles in another language, it would still technically meet the condition of the original statement. But if we are to consider the possibility of subtitles being present, then the inferred statement \"The movie must have been subtitled or in English\" would cover all possible scenarios where the movie is either originally in English or in another language but has English subtitles. Therefore, the inference is reasonable.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
