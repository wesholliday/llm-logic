The statement \"The book must be in the library or on the shelf\" is making a broader claim about the location of the book, suggesting that it could be in the library or on the shelf, but not specifying that it is necessarily on the shelf. Without further information, we cannot infer that the book is in the library, only that it is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: No."
