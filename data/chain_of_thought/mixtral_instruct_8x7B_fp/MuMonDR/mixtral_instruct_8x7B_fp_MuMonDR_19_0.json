            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The application must have been completed online\" implies that there is no other option to complete the application except online. It inherently excludes the possibility of completing the application in person. Therefore, if we were to consider the possibility of the application being completed in person, we would be adding an option that is not allowed by the original statement. This is a logical fallacy known as \"adding to the premises.\" Hence, we cannot infer that \"The application must have been completed in person or online\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
