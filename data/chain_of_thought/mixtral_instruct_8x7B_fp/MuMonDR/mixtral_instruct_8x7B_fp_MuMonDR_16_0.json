            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The room must have been cleaned daily\" implies that the cleaning of the room is a regular, daily occurrence. However, this does not necessarily mean that the room can also be cleaned upon request. The phrase \"The room must have been cleaned upon request or daily\" introduces the possibility of the room being cleaned in response to a request, which is not included in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that the room must have been cleaned upon request based on the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: No."
