            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package must have been delivered today\" implies that the delivery of the package is certain to have occurred on the day that has already been completed, which is today. The statement \"The package must have been delivered tomorrow or today\" suggests that the delivery could have happened on the upcoming day (tomorrow) as well. Since the original statement asserts that the delivery took place today, it doesn't provide any room for the package to be delivered tomorrow. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The package must have been delivered tomorrow or today\" from \"The package must have been delivered today\".\n\nAnswer: No."
