It does not necessarily mean that the signature was witnessed or authenticated by a notary public. Notarization is the process of having a document signed and then stamped or sealed by a notary public to verify the identity of the signer and ensure that they are signing voluntarily. Therefore, the statement \"The document must have been signed\" does not allow us to infer that the document was notarized.\n\nAnswer: No."
