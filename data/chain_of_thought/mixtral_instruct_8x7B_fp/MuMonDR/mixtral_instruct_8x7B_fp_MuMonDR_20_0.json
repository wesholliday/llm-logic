            "content": "Explanation: The term \"formal\" in the statement \"The event must have been formal\" implies a certain level of formality in the event's dress code or conduct. A semi-formal event also requires a higher level of dress and etiquette compared to casual events, although it is less strict than a formal event. Since a semi-formal event falls under the category of events that are not as casual as informal events but not as strict as formal events, it can be inferred that if an event must have been formal, then it could also have been semi-formal or formal.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
