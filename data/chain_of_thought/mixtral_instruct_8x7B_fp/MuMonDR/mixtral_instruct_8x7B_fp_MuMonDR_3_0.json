It does not explicitly state that the keys cannot be on the table or any other location. However, the statement does not provide any information that would allow us to infer that the keys could also be on the table. Therefore, based on the given statement, we cannot infer that the keys must be on the table or in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: No."
