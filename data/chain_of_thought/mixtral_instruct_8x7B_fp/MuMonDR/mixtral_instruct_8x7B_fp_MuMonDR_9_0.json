            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The flight must have been delayed' implies that the flight did not operate at its scheduled time. When we consider the possibility that 'The flight must have been on time', it contradicts the original statement because 'on time' and 'delayed' are mutually exclusive. Therefore, the inferred statement would be 'The flight must have been on time or delayed', but this is equivalent to the original statement. So, inferring 'The flight must have been on time or delayed' from 'The flight must have been delayed' does not add any new information.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
