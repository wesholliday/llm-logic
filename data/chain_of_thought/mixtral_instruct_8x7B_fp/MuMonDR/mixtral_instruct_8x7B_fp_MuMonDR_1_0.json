It could be on any floor of a building. In order to infer that the envelope must be upstairs or under a bed, we would need additional information that the bed in question is located upstairs. Without this information, we cannot make the inference that the envelope must be upstairs or under a bed. It could be on the first floor or in a basement, as long as it is under a bed.\n\nAnswer: No."
