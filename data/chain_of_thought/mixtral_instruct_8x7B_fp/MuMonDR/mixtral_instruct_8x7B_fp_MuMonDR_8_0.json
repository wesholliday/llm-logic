The suggested inference \"The restaurant must have been open for limited hours or closed on Mondays\" includes an additional possibility that the restaurant could be open with limited hours on other days. This goes beyond the information provided in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot make this inference based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No."
