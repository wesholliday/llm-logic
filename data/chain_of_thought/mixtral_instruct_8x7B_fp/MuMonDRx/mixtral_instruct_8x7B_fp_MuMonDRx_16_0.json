The introduction of new terms 'quimble' and 'flonk' without any context or definition makes it impossible to establish a logical connection between the two statements. In order to determine if one statement can be inferred from another, we need to have a clear understanding of the terms and concepts involved, as well as the logical relationships between them.\n\nAnswer: No."
