            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The frazzle must be wozzle on quork\" contains the term 'wozzle on quork' which is applied to 'frazzle'. The proposed statement \"The frazzle must be frazzle for snorkel quork or wozzle on quork\" includes the term 'frazzle' twice, once as it is and the second time as 'frazzle for snorkel quork'. The latter term is not mentioned or implied in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the proposed statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
