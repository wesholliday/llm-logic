However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the fizzle can't also be froodle under the same or different conditions. \n\nTo infer that 'The fizzle must be froodle or zizz by zooble', we would need additional information suggesting that the fizzle can have more than one state or characteristic under zooble's influence. Without such information, we cannot infer that the fizzle can be froodle as well.\n\nAnswer: No."
