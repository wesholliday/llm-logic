It does not exclude the possibility that the grazzle could also be frazzle, but it also does not explicitly state that the grazzle must be frazzle.\n\nIn order to infer that \"The grazzle must be frazzle or wumble,\" we would need some additional information or context that suggests that the grazzle can only be in one of those two states. For example, if we knew that the only possible states for the grazzle were being frazzle or wumble, then we could infer that it must be one or the other based on the original statement.\n\nHowever, without any additional information, we cannot make this inference. It is possible that the grazzle could be both frazzle and wumble, or that it could be some other state entirely. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that the grazzle must be frazzle or wumble based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
