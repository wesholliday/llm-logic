It does not indicate any other possible locations for the grooble. The phrase 'The grooble must be in grazzle or blimp zibble' suggests that there are two possible locations for the grooble, 'grazzle' and 'blimp zibble'. Since the original statement does not provide any information about 'grazzle' or imply that it is a possible location for the grooble, we cannot infer that 'The grooble must be in grazzle or blimp zibble' based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
