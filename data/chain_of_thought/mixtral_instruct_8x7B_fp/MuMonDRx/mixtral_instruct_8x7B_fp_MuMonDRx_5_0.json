It does not rule out other possibilities, but it also does not provide any information that would suggest other possibilities. In order to infer that the snorkel must be 'quorple or glorp zizz', there would need to be some indication that the snorkel could be 'quorple'. However, there is no such indication in the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
