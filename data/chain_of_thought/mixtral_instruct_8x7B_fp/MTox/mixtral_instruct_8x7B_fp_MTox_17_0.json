We know that \"The flob did not movated\" (which should be \"motivated,\" but I'll stick with the original spelling). This tells us that, for whatever reason, the flob did not move or take action.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional: \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\" This can be rewritten in logical notation as: Skizzled(flob) -> Movated(flob).\n\n3. Now, we want to find out if we can infer that \"The flob was not skizzled\" (Not(Skizzled(flob))) from these two statements.\n\n4. To do this, we'll use a technique called contrapositive reasoning. The contrapositive of a conditional statement (if P, then Q) is: if NOT Q, then NOT P. In our case, the contrapositive of the second statement would be: Not(Movated(flob)) -> Not(Skizzled(flob)).\n\n5. Since we know that \"The flob did not movated\" (Not(Movated(flob))), and the contrapositive of the second statement tells us that Not(Movated(flob)) -> Not(Skizzled(flob)), we can now infer that \"The flob was not skizzled\" (Not(Skizzled(flob))).\n\nAnswer: Yes."
