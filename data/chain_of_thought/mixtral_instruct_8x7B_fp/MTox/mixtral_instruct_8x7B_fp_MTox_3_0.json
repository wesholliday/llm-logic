            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The splat did not quank' implies that the splat did not exhibit the behavior of quanking. The statement 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked' is a conditional statement, which means that if the splat was morphed, then it would quank. However, the negation of the conclusion of this conditional statement (that the splat quanked) has already been established as false. Therefore, the negation of the condition (that the splat was morphed) must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
