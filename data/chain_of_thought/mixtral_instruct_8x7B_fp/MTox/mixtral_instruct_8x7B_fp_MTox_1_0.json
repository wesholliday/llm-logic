If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the flugel is in a state that is not zargled. \n\nNow let's analyze statement 2. It's a conditional statement which means if the condition (the flugel being blimmed) is true, then the consequence (the flugel being zargled) must also be true.\n\nHowever, since statement 1 tells us that the flugel is not zargled, this contradicts the consequence of statement 2. Therefore, in order for statement 2's consequence to be true (the flugel being zargled), its condition (the flugel being blimmed) must be false.\n\nSo yes, from 'The flugel was not zargled' and 'If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled', we can infer 'The flugel was not blimmed'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
