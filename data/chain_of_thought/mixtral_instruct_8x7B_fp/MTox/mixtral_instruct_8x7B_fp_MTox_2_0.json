If the condition (the wug being flooped) is true, then the result (the wug bimming the zoint) follows.\n\nTo infer \"The wug was not flooped\", we need to establish that the condition that leads to the wug bimming the zoint is not met. However, the given information does not provide any direct link between the wug not bimming the zoint and the wug not being flooped. It's possible that the wug isn't flooped, but it's also possible that the wug is flooped but still didn't bim the zoint for some other reason.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that \"The wug was not flooped\".\n\nAnswer: No."
