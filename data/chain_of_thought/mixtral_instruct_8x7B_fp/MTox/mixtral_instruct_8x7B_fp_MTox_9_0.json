If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the twonk is not varnished. \n\nNow let's consider statement 2. It says that if the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished. This is a conditional statement where the condition is 'the twonk was plinked' and the result is 'it was varnished'.\n\nSince we already know from statement 1 that the twonk is not varnished, this contradicts the result part of the conditional statement in 2. Therefore, the condition (that the twonk was plinked) cannot be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The twonk was not plinked'."
