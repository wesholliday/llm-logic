            "content": "Explanation: The sentence 'The wug was not garbled' tells us that the wug was in a state that did not meet the criteria for being garbled. The second sentence, 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garbled', is a conditional statement that tells us that if the wug was in a sproinged state, then it would also be in a garbled state. However, since we know that the wug was not garbled, it cannot be true that it was sproinged. Therefore, from these two sentences, we can infer that 'The wug was not sproinged'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
