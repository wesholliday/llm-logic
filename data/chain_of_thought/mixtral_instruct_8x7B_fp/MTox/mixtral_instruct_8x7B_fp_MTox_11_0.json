The second statement is \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The flug was not blummed,\" we need to analyze whether the truth of the second statement contradicts the first statement. If it does, then we could potentially infer \"The flug was not blummed.\"\n\nThe second statement is in the form of a conditional statement, often called an \"if-then\" statement. In this case, the statement can be broken down as follows:\n- The flug being blummed is the condition (if part).\n- The flug being zimmed is the consequence (then part).\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility of the flug being blummed. According to the second statement, if the flug were blummed, it would also have to be zimmed. However, the first statement contradicts this possibility by stating that the flug was not zimmed.\n\nSince the first statement negates the possibility of the flug being zimmed, the flug cannot be both blummed and zimmed at the same time, assuming the logic is consistent and without exceptions.\n\nTherefore, if the flug is not zimmed, as stated in the first statement, and it would have to be zimmed if the flug were blummed, as stated in the second statement, we can indeed infer that the flug was not blummed.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
