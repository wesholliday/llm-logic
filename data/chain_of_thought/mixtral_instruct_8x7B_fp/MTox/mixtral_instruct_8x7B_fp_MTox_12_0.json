If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.\n\nWe are asked if we can infer that \"The smip was not shripped\" from these two statements.\n\nTo do this, let's first assume that the second statement is true: \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the smip being shripped) is met, then the consequence (the smip lapping the zoint) follows.\n\nHowever, the first statement tells us that the smip did not lup the zoint. Since the second statement says that the smip would only have lapped the zoint if it was shripped, the fact that the smip did not lup the zoint implies that the smip was not shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
