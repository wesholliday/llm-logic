If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nFrom this, we want to determine if we can infer that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nTo do this, let's consider the second statement as a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A represents \"the sneg was crampled\" and B represents \"the sneg sprotet the frink.\"\n\nGiven that the second statement is a conditional statement, we can use logical reasoning to analyze it. Specifically, we can use contrapositive reasoning. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the sneg did not sprotet the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nSince the first statement is \"The sneg did not sprotet the frink,\" and the contrapositive of the second statement is also \"The sneg did not sprotet the frink implies that the sneg was not crampled,\" we can indeed infer that \"The sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes."
