If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the sprocket being cranked and the sprocket being daggled are directly related - if one happens, so does the other. \n\nGiven that the sprocket is not daggled, according to the second statement, it follows that the sprocket was also not cranked. This is a form of logical reasoning known as contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
