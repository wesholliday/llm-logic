To determine if we can infer \"The dreb was not vroombed\", we need to consider the logical relationship between these statements.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the dreb was vroombed) is true, then the consequence (the dreb was spened) must also be true.\n\nHowever, the first statement tells us that the consequence (the dreb was spened) is actually false. Since the consequence is false, this means that the condition cannot be true, because if the condition were true, then the consequence would also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that \"The dreb was not vroombed\", because if the dreb had been vroombed, then it would have been spened, but we know that it was not spened.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
