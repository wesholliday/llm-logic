If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\n\nWe want to find out if we can infer that the shank was not plooked. \n\nTo do this, let's consider the second statement as a conditional statement: \"If plooked, then nugged.\" This means that if the shank was plooked, it would definitely be nugged.\n\nHowever, we know from the first statement that the shank was not nugged. Given the conditional statement, this implies that the shank could not have been plooked either, because if it were, it would have been nugged.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that the shank was not plooked."
