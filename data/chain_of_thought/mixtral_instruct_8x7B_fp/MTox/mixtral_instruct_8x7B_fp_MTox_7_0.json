It tells us that if the whiffle was shanked, then we would hear a \"tink\" sound.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer from this information. The key is to remember that the \"if-then\" statement only applies when the conditions are met. In this case, the condition is that the whiffle must be shanked for the whiffle to tink. However, we know from the first statement that the whiffle did not tink. Therefore, the condition stated in the \"if-then\" statement was not met, which implies that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
