            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled' is a conditional statement, also known as an 'if-then' statement. It means that if the zinger has the quality of being fraggled, then it will definitely have the quality of being smoogled.\n\nThe negation of this conditional statement would be 'The zinger is not fraggled AND the zinger is smoogled' or 'The zinger is not fraggled, but the zinger might still be smoogled'.\n\nHowever, the given statement 'The zinger was not smoogled' contradicts the second part of the negation. If the zinger was not smoogled, then it cannot be the case that the zinger is not fraggled but still smoogled.\n\nTherefore, from 'The zinger was not smoogled' and 'If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled', we can infer 'The zinger was not fraggled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
