It means that if the fleeg had performed the action 'bluttered', then it would have performed the action 'surn'.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot directly infer that 'The fleeg was not bluttered'. The given information only tells us about the actions 'surn' and 'bluttered', but it doesn't explicitly state whether the fleeg performed 'bluttered' or not.\n\nHowever, the given information also doesn't contradict the statement 'The fleeg was not bluttered', so we can assume it to be true based on the available information.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
