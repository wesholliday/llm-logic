It means that the glip did not undergo some process or action that would make it 'tragged'.\n\n2. \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\" - This is a conditional statement, also known as an \"if-then\" statement. If the glip undergoes the action of 'slogging', then as a result, the glip will be 'tragged'.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot infer that 'The glip was not slogged'. The given information only tells us that the glip was not 'tragged' and what the result would be if the glip was 'slogged'. It does not provide any information about whether or not the glip was 'slogged'.\n\nAnswer: No."
