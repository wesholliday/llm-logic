It tells us that if the 'fleeg' (whatever that may be) has been 'bluttered' (again, whatever that may mean), then it has 'surned' (and we don't know what that means either).\n\nThe first sentence, 'The fleeg was bluttered', is telling us that the condition in the second sentence has been met - the 'fleeg' has been 'bluttered'. \n\nSince the condition has been met, and the conditional statement tells us that when the condition is met, the 'fleeg' has 'surned', we can indeed infer that 'The fleeg surned'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
