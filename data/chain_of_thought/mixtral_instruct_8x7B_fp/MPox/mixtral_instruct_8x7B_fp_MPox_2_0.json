It does not state that the condition is true.\n\nIn this case, the given statement \"The wug was flooped\" is a separate piece of information and does not directly relate to the conditional statement. However, since the condition stated in the conditional statement is now known to be true (the wug was flooped), it follows that the consequence must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes."
