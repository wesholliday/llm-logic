It tells us that if the 'twonk' undergoes the action of 'being plinked', then it is also true that it was 'varnished'. \n\nThe first sentence, 'The twonk was plinked', is stating that the action of 'plinking' has indeed occurred to the 'twonk'. \n\nGiven that the conditional statement is true and the action of 'plinking' the 'twonk' has been confirmed, we can infer from the conditional statement that the 'twonk' was also 'varnished'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
