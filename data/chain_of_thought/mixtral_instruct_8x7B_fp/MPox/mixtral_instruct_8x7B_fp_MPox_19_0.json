However, we have another statement 'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the smonk was vreebled) is true, then the consequence (the smonk plagged) must also be true.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that if the smonk was vreebled, then it plagged. But we still don't know if the smonk was actually vreebled or not. Since the first statement doesn't provide enough information to determine whether the smonk was vreebled or not, we cannot definitively say whether the smonk plagged or not.\n\nAnswer: No."
