Given the two statements \"The splat was morphed\" and \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\", we can infer that \"The splat quanked\".\n\nThe first statement \"The splat was morphed\" is a factual statement that tells us that the splat has undergone some change. The second statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" is a conditional statement that tells us that if the splat has undergone some change (which we know from the first statement), then the splat has the property of \"quanking\".\n\nTherefore, since the splat has undergone the change mentioned in the first statement and the second statement tells us that if the splat undergoes that change, then it has the property of \"quanking\", we can infer that \"The splat quanked\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
