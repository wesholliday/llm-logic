In this case, P represents 'The whiffle was shanked' and Q represents 'The whiffle tinked'. \n\nThe given statement 'The whiffle was shanked' matches the condition P in our conditional statement. According to the rules of logic, if the condition P is true, then the statement Q (the consequence) must also be true. This is known as Modus Ponens.\n\nTherefore, since 'The whiffle was shanked' is true, it follows that 'The whiffle tinked' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
