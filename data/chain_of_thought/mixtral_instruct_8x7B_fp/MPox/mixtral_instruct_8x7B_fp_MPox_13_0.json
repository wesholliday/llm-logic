It doesn't necessarily mean that the glip was actually tragged, it only means that *if* the glip was slogged, *then* it was tragged.\n\nHowever, the first sentence 'The glip was slogged' is a declarative statement that asserts the glip was indeed slogged. If we accept this statement as true, then we can apply the condition from the second sentence, and infer that the glip was tragged.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
