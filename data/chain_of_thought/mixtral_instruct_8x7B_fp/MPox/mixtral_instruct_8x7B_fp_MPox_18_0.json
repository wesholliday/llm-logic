            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged' is a conditional statement, also known as an if-then statement. It means that the action of nugging the shank follows logically from the action of plooking the shank. In other words, plooking the shank is a sufficient condition for nugging the shank.\n\nIn this case, we are given that the shank was plooked. Since plooking the shank is a sufficient condition for nugging the shank, it follows that the shank was nugged.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
