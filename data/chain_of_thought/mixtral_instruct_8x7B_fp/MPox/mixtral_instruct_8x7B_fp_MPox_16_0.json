            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The sneg was crampled\" is a factual claim about the state of the sneg, but it does not provide any information about the frink or whether the sneg sprouted it. The second statement \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sprouted the frink\" is a conditional statement that only specifies the necessary condition for the sneg to sprout the frink. It does not specify whether the sneg actually sprouted the frink.\n\nHowever, the given information allows us to make a logical deduction based on the principle of modus ponens. According to this principle, if a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is true and the antecedent P is also true, then the consequent Q must also be true. In this case, P is \"the sneg was crampled\" and Q is \"the sneg sprouted the frink\". Since both the conditional statement and the antecedent are true, we can infer that the consequent \"the sneg sprouted the frink\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
