            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical inference and the concept of transitivity in logic. The statement given is a conditional one: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\". This means that the two events, the sprocket being cranked and the sprocket being daggled, are logically connected. \n\nGiven this conditional statement, if we are told that the sprocket was indeed cranked, we can apply transitivity and infer that the sprocket was therefore daggled. This is because the conditional statement tells us that the two events are linked, so if the first event (the sprocket being cranked) is true, then the second event (the sprocket being daggled) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
