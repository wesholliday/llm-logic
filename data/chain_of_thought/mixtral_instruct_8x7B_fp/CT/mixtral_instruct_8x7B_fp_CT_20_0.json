            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\". This statement can be rephrased as \"If not B, then not A\", which is the contrapositive of the original statement. \n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nIn this case, the original statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\". The negation of this statement is \"The apple was not red\". The negation of the conclusion \"the banana was yellow\" is \"the banana was not yellow\".\n\nSo, the contrapositive statement is \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
