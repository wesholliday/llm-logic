            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim' is a conditional statement in the form of 'if p, then q'. This statement does not cover all possibilities; it only tells us what happens to the pants (they are denim) when the shirt is cotton. It does not tell us anything about what happens when the pants are not denim.\n\nHowever, we want to infer 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton'. This is the contrapositive of the original statement, which would be true if the original statement was true. But since the original statement does not cover all possibilities, we cannot be sure that its contrapositive is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton' from 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'.\n\nAnswer: No."
