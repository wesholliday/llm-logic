It can be symbolized as 'Sue choosing pizza (S) implies Bob choosing pasta (B)', or 'S -> B'.\n\nTo determine if the converse 'If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza' is true, we need to consider the possible scenarios. The original statement 'S -> B' means that in the case where Sue chooses pizza (S is true), Bob must choose pasta (B is true). However, it does not specify what happens when Sue does not choose pizza (S is false).\n\nIn order for the converse to be true, the absence of Bob choosing pasta (B being false) would have to imply that Sue did not choose pizza (S being false). But from the original statement, we cannot definitively conclude this.\n\nAnswer: No."
