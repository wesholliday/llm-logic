To infer 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake', we need to find the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is 'if not q then not p'. In this case, 'not q' is 'the mummy was not awake' and 'not p' is 'the vampire was not awake'. Since the given statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, the answer is 'yes'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
