The part 'Tom watched football' is the hypothesis, and 'Jen watched basketball' is the conclusion. \n\nTo determine if the converse 'If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football' can be inferred, we need to consider the truth values of the original statement. \n\nIf the original statement is true, then whenever Tom watched football, Jen also watched basketball. However, the original statement does not tell us anything about what happens when Jen does not watch basketball. It could be that she never watches basketball, or it could be that sometimes she watches basketball but sometimes she doesn't.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the converse statement 'If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football' because the original statement does not provide enough information to make this conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No."
