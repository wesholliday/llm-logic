The contrapositive of this statement is \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race\". In logic, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if we know that the original statement is true, we can infer that the contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
