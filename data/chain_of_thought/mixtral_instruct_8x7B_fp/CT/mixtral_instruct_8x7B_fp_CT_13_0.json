            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of logical equivalence in the field of logic. The given statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' can be rewritten as 'If the car is not red, then the truck is blue' (this is known as the contrapositive and is logically equivalent to the original statement). From this contrapositive, we can infer 'If the truck is not blue, then the car is not red'. This is because if the truck is not blue, then according to the contrapositive, the car is not red. Therefore, the answer to the question is 'yes'."
