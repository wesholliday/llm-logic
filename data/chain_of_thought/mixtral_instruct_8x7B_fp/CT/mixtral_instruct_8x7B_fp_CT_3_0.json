The original statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' can be restated as 'If P, then Q'. Here, P represents 'the book was written by James' and Q represents 'the book is a mystery novel'. \n\nWe want to find out if we can infer 'If not Q, then not P'. This is the contrapositive of the original statement, which is logically equivalent to 'If P, then Q'. Therefore, if 'If P, then Q' is true, then 'If not Q, then not P' is also true.\n\nIn this case, 'not Q' represents 'the book is not a mystery novel', and 'not P' represents 'the book was not written by James'. So, we can infer 'If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
