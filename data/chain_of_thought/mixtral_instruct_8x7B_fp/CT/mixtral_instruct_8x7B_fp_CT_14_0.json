This is because the two statements are opposite sides of the same implication. The first statement says that the bear being in the cave implies that the wolf is in the den. The second statement says that the wolf not being in the den implies that the bear is not in the cave. These two statements are logically equivalent because they both express the same relationship between the bear and the wolf, just in different ways.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
