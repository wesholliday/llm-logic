            "content": "Explanation: This question is asking about the logical relationship between two statements, specifically whether the first statement implies the second one. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\" This can be represented as:\n\nalien(Mars) -> robot(Jupiter)\n\nThe second statement is also a conditional statement, but it is the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then swapping their order. If the first statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa. Therefore, the second statement can be represented as:\n\nnot robot(Jupiter) -> not alien(Mars)\n\nSince the second statement is the contrapositive of the first statement, and the first statement is true, it follows that the second statement is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
