The forward implication of this statement is that if Lisa bought the red shirt (antecedent), then Mark bought the blue shirt (consequent). \n\nHowever, the statement we are asked to infer is the converse of this, 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt'. \n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we need to consider the truth of both the original statement and its converse. \n\nThe original statement does not necessarily mean that if Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, then Lisa didn't buy the red shirt. Mark could have bought something else other than the blue shirt. Therefore, we cannot directly infer the converse statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
