            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"if p then q\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"if not q then not p\". In this case, p is \"Jeff played basketball\" and q is \"Amy played tennis\". The contrapositive \"if not q then not p\" can be written as \"if Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\". \n\nTo infer the contrapositive, we need to make sure that the original statement and the contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning they have the same truth value. This is indeed the case, so we can infer 'If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
