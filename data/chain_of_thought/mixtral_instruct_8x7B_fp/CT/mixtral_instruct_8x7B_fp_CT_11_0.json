            "content": "Explanation: This is a question of logical inference, specifically testing for the validity of a contrapositive statement. The original statement is \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\". This is a conditional statement, denoted as \"If P, then Q\". \n\nThe contrapositive of this statement is \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\", denoted as \"If not Q, then not P\". \n\nIn logic, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. This is because they are logically equivalent. \n\nHowever, we don't know if the original statement is true or not. We are only given the statement, not the truth values of P or Q. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether the contrapositive is true or false based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: No. We cannot infer 'If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate' because we don't know if the original statement 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' is true or false."
