            "content": "Explanation: This statement is an example of a logical concept known as contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". If we negate both the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement, the two statements are logically equivalent. \n\nHere, the original statement is \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\". Its contrapositive would be \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside\". \n\nSo, yes, from the original statement, we can infer 'If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
