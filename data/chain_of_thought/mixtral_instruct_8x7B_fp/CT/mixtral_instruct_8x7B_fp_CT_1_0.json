The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning they have the same truth value. \n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding'. \n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the desired statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
