            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' is a conditional statement in the form 'if p then q'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'if not q then not p'. In this case, 'not q' is 'the truck was not metal' and 'not p' is 'the doll was not plastic'. Therefore, the contrapositive of the given statement is 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic'. Since the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic' from 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
