            "content": "Explanation: This statement is an example of a logical construct known as a contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. In this case, P is 'the griffin was in the forest' and Q is 'the unicorn was in the forest'. The given statement is 'If P, then Q'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If not Q, then not P', which can be stated as 'If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest'. Since the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
