            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical inference and specifically about the logical relationship between two statements. The original statement is a conditional one, often called \"if-then\" statement in everyday language. It can be symbolized as \"If P, then Q\", where P stands for \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q stands for \"Kate ate the salad\". \n\nThe statement we want to infer is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement and then reversing their order, resulting in \"If not Q, then not P\". In this case, it means \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\".\n\nThe logical rule states that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning they have the same truth value. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true, and we can validly infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
