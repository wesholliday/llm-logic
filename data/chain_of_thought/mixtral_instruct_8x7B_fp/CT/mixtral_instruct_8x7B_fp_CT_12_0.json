            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical inference, specifically whether the given conditional statement implies its contrapositive. The original statement is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nTo understand why these two statements are equivalent, consider the possible scenarios. If Joe did not go to the park, then the original statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is vacuously true, regardless of whether Lucy went to the zoo or not. However, if Lucy did not go to the zoo, then the original statement cannot be true, so Joe must not have gone to the park either. Therefore, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
