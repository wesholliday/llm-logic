            "content": "Explanation: This question is asking about the logical relationship between two statements. The first statement is \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\" This is a conditional statement, often denoted as \"If P, then Q.\"\n\nThe statement we are asked to consider is \"If the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged,\" or in logical notation, \"If not P, then not Q.\"\n\nThe logical relationship we are checking for here is called contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nTo determine if \"If the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged\" is the contrapositive of \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged,\" we can check if \"not Q\" and \"not P\" in the second statement correspond to \"not P\" and \"not Q\" in the first statement, respectively.\n\nHere, \"not Q\" is \"the clug was not snugged\" and \"not P\" is \"the clug was not fleeked.\" In the first statement, \"not P\" is indeed followed by \"then not Q,\" which matches the structure of the second statement.\n\nTherefore, the second statement is indeed the contrapositive of the first statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
