This statement only tells us about the relationship between the cranking and dangling of the sprocket when the sprocket is cranked. It does not tell us anything about what happens when the sprocket is not cranked.\n\nTo infer 'If the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled', we need a contrapositive statement of the original statement. The contrapositive of 'If p then q' is 'If not q then not p'. Applying this rule to the original statement, we get 'If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked'. However, this is not given in the question.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer 'If the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled'.\n\nAnswer: No."
