            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical reasoning question that involves a concept called contrapositive. The original statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" is in the form of \"If P, then Q\". The statement we want to infer is \"If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank\", which is in the form of \"If not P, then not Q\". These two statements are logically equivalent, which means if the original statement is true, then the inferred statement must also be true, and vice versa. This relationship is known as the contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
