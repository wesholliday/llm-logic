            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical reasoning question that involves a concept called contrapositive. The original statement \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\" is in the form of \"If P, then Q\". The negation of this statement is \"If not P, then not Q\". The contrapositive of the original statement is the same as the negation of the original statement. In this case, the contrapositive is \"If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink\". Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer that if the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
