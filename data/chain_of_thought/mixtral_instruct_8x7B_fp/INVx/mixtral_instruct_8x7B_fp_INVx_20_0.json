            "content": "Explanation: This question is asking about the logical relationship between two statements, and whether the second statement can be inferred from the first. This is a form of logical reasoning called contrapositive reasoning. The contrapositive of a statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. If a statement and its contrapositive are both true, then they are logically equivalent.\n\nIn this case, the first statement is 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned'. The contrapositive of this statement would be 'If the fleeg did not surn, then it was not bluttered'. However, the statement we are asked to infer is 'If the fleeg was not bluttered, then it did not surn'. This statement is not the contrapositive of the original statement, but it is logically equivalent to the contrapositive.\n\nTherefore, if we can infer the contrapositive of the original statement, we can also infer the statement we are asked to infer.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer the contrapositive of the original statement, we need to consider the meanings of the terms 'bluttered' and 'surned' in this context. If these terms are such that the original statement is true, then its contrapositive will also be true.\n\nAssuming that the terms 'bluttered' and 'surned' are such that the original statement is true, then we can infer the contrapositive of the original statement, which is 'If the fleeg did not surn, then it was not bluttered'. Since this statement is logically equivalent to 'If the fleeg was not bluttered, then it did not surn', we can also infer this statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
