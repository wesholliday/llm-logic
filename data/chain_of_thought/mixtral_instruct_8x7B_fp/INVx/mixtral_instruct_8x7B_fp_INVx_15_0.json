            "content": "Explanation: This question is asking about the logical relationship between two statements, specifically whether the first statement implies the second. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\" This can be represented as P -> Q, where P is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and Q is \"the dreb was spened.\"\n\nThe second statement we are asked to consider is the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement P -> Q is ~Q -> ~P. In this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\" This is logically equivalent to the original statement, so if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nHowever, the statement we are asked to infer is not the contrapositive of the original statement. Instead, it is another conditional statement: \"If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened.\" This can be represented as ~P -> ~Q.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer this statement from the original statement, we need to consider the possible truth values of P and Q. If P is true (the dreb was vroombed), then Q must also be true (the dreb was spened). If P is false (the dreb was not vroombed), then we cannot determine the truth value of Q from the original statement alone.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened\" is true based on the original statement alone. It is possible that the dreb was not vroombed but was still spened, or it is possible that the dreb was not vroombed and not spened. We would need additional information to determine which of these possibilities is the case.\n\nAnswer: No."
