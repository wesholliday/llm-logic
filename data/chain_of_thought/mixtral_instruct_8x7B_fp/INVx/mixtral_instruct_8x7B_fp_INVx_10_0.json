            "content": "Explanation: This question is asking about the logical relationship between two statements, and whether the second statement (the conclusion) follows from the first statement (the premise). This is a form of logical reasoning called contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. If the original statement and its contrapositive are both true, then they are logically equivalent.\n\nIn this case, the original statement is 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garbled'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If the wug was not garbled, then it was not sproinged'. This is equivalent to the statement 'If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garbled'.\n\nTo determine if the contrapositive is true, we need to consider the meanings of the words 'sproinged' and 'garbled' in this context. If 'sproinged' means that some action has been taken on the wug that causes it to be in a certain state, and 'garbled' means that the wug is in a particular state as a result of that action, then it is reasonable to assume that if the wug is not in that state, then the action has not been taken.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, we can infer that 'If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garbled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
