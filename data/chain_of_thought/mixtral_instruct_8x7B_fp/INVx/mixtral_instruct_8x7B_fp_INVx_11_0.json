            "content": "Explanation: This question is asking about the logical relationship between the statements \"if P, then Q\" and \"if not P, then not Q\". This is called the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nIn this case, the original statement is \"if the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\", which can be written as \"if P, then Q\". The negation of P is \"the flug was not blummed\", and the negation of Q is \"the flug was not zimmed\". \n\nSo, the contrapositive statement is \"if the flug was not blummed, then the flug was not zimmed\", which can be written as \"if not P, then not Q\". \n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer 'If the flug was not blummed, then the flug was not zimmed' from 'If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
