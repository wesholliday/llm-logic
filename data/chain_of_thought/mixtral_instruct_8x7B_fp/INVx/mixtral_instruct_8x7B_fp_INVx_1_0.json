            "content": "Explanation: This question is asking about the logical relationship between two statements, specifically whether the first statement implies the second one. This is a form of logical reasoning called contrapositive reasoning. The contrapositive of a statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. If the contrapositive of a statement is true, then the original statement is also true, and vice versa.\n\nIn this case, the original statement is 'If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled'. The contrapositive of this statement would be 'If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed'. However, this is not the statement that we are being asked to infer. Instead, we are being asked to infer 'If the flugel was not blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled'.\n\nThis statement is not the contrapositive of the original statement, but it is logically equivalent to it. If the original statement is true, then this statement must also be true, and vice versa. This is because if it is not the case that 'the flugel was blimmed implies the flugel was zargled', then it must be the case that 'the flugel was not zargled implies the flugel was not blimmed'.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we can infer 'If the flugel was not blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
