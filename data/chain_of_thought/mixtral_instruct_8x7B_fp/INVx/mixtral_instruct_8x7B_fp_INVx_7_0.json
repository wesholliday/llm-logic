            "content": "Explanation: This question is asking about the logical relationship between two statements, which is a question of logical inference and the concept of contrapositive. The original statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"the whiffle was shanked\" and Q is \"the whiffle tinked\". The statement we want to infer is the contrapositive of this statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P\". The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, if the original statement \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
