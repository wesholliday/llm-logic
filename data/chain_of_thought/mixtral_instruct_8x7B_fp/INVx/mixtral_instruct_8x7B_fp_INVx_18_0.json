            "content": "Explanation: This question is an application of the concept of logical transitivity and contrapositive. The original statement 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged' is in the form of an implication, where the condition (shank was plooked) implies the consequence (shank was nugged). \n\nTo determine if the contrapositive of this statement is true, we negate both the condition and the consequence and then reverse their order, resulting in 'If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked'. \n\nThe contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa. \n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we can infer 'If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
