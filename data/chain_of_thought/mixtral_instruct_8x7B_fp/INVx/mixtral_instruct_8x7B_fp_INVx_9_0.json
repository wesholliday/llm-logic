            "content": "Explanation: This question is asking about the logical relationship between two statements. The first statement is \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\" This is a conditional statement, often denoted as \"If P, then Q.\"\n\nThe statement we are asked to consider is \"If the twonk was not plinked, then it was not varnished.\" This is also a conditional statement, but with the negative form of the first statement's condition.\n\nThe logical relationship between these two statements is called the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\" is \"If the twonk was not varnished, then it was not plinked.\"\n\nThis is different from the statement we are asked to consider, \"If the twonk was not plinked, then it was not varnished.\"\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: No."
