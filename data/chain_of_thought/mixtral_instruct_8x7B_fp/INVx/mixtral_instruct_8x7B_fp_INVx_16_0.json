            "content": "Explanation: This question is asking about the logical relationship between two statements, which is a concept known as logical contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". If the original statement and its contrapositive are both true, then they are logically equivalent.\n\nIn this case, the original statement is \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\". The negation of the conclusion is \"the sneg did not sprot the frink\", and the negation of the premise is \"the sneg was not crampled\". Therefore, the contrapositive of the original statement is \"If the sneg did not sprot the frink, then the sneg was not crampled\".\n\nTo determine whether we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement, we need to consider whether the original statement is true and whether it is a logically necessary relationship. In other words, is it logically possible for the sneg to be crampled and not sprot the frink, or for the sneg to not be crampled and still sprot the frink?\n\nWithout knowing the exact meanings of \"sneg,\" \"crampled,\" and \"sprot,\" it is difficult to say for sure. However, if we assume that \"crampled\" and \"sprot\" are mutually exclusive conditions (i.e., the sneg cannot be both crampled and sprot at the same time), then it is not possible for the sneg to be crampled and not sprot the frink. Therefore, the original statement implies that if the sneg was not crampled, it also did not sprot the frink.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
