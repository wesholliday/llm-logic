The original statement is \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\" To form the contrapositive of this statement, we negate both the hypothesis and the conclusion, and then reverse the order to get \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\" This is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nHowever, the statement we are asked to infer is not the contrapositive of the original statement. Instead, it is the converse, which is \"If the wug was not flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint.\" While the converse of a statement can sometimes be true, it is not necessarily true simply because the original statement is true.\n\nTo determine whether the converse is true, we would need to know more about the relationship between flooping and bimming zoints for wugs. If flooping always precedes bimming zoints, then the converse would be true. However, if there are cases where a wug bims a zoint without being flooped, then the converse would be false.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that the converse is true.\n\nAnswer: No."
