            "content": "Explanation: This question is asking about the logical relationship between two statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\" This can be represented as p -> q, where p represents \"the smonk was vreebled\" and q represents \"the smonk plagged.\"\n\nThe statement we want to infer is also a conditional statement, but it is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then swapping their positions. So, the contrapositive of p -> q is ~q -> ~p. In this case, ~q represents \"the smonk was not plagged\" and ~p represents \"the smonk was not vreebled.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa. Therefore, if we know that the original statement \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\" is true, then we can infer that its contrapositive \"If the smonk was not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
