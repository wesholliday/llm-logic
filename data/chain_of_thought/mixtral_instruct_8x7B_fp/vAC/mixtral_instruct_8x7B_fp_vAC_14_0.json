The argument can be represented as:\n\nPremise 1: If P, then Q\nPremise 2: P\nConclusion: Q\n\nIn this case, P represents 'the bear was in the cave' and Q represents 'the wolf was in the den'. Given the second premise that 'the wolf was in the den', if the conditional statement in the first premise is true, then the conclusion 'the bear was in the cave' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
