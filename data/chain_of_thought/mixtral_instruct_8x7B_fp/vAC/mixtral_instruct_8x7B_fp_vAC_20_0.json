The truth of the second premise (the banana was yellow) does not guarantee the truth of the first premise (if the apple was red). Even if the banana was yellow, the apple could have been any color, including red. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the apple was red based on these premises.\n\nAnswer: No."
