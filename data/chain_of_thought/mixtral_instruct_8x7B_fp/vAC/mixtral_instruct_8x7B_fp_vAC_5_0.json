In this case, P represents 'Jeff played basketball' and Q represents 'Amy played tennis.' The second premise 'Amy played tennis' is the statement Q in our general form. The conclusion 'Jeff played basketball' is the statement P in our general form. Since all the conditions for Modus Ponens are met, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
