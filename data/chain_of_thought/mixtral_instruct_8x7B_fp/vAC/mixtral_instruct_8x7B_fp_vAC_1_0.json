            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. The argument is valid if and only if the truth of the premises would guarantee the truth of the conclusion. In this case, the first premise states that Mary's presence at the wedding is a sufficient condition for Sue's presence at the wedding. The second premise asserts that Sue was indeed at the wedding. Therefore, if the first premise is true, then Mary must have been at the wedding as well, because Sue's presence is a guaranteed result of Mary's presence. Hence, the conclusion \"Mary was at the wedding\" is a necessary consequence of the premises, making the argument valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
