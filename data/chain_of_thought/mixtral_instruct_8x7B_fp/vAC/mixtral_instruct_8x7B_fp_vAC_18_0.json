            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. The argument has the general form 'If P, then Q; P; therefore, Q'. In this case, P is 'the doll was plastic' and Q is 'the truck was metal'. The second premise 'the truck was metal' (Q) is given, and if the first premise 'if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' (if P, then Q) is true, then the conclusion 'the doll was plastic' (P) logically follows. However, it's important to note that the truth of the conclusion depends on the truth of the premises. If either of the premises is false, the argument is still valid but not sound.\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid."
