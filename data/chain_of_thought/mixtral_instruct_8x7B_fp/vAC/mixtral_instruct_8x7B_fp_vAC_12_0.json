The general form of Modus Ponens is: \n\nP1: If P, then Q\nP2: P\nC: Therefore, Q\n\nIn this case, the first premise (P1) is 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'. The second premise (P2) is 'Lucy went to the zoo'. To determine if the argument is valid, we assume that the premises are true and see if the conclusion necessarily follows. \n\nHere, since P2 states that Lucy went to the zoo, and P1 states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo, it must be the case that Joe went to the park. If Lucy went to the zoo without Joe going to the park, the first premise would be false, which would violate our assumption that both premises are true. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
