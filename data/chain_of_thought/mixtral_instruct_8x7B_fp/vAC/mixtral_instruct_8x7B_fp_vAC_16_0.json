            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is called modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. The general form is: if P, then Q; P; therefore, Q. In this case, P is 'the shirt was cotton' and Q is 'the pants were denim'. The second premise 'the pants were denim' corresponds to Q in the general form. The conclusion 'the shirt was cotton' corresponds to P in the general form. Since the argument follows the valid form of modus ponens, the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
