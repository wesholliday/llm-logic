In this case, the first premise 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' can be rewritten as 'If dog\\_inside, then cat\\_outside'. The second premise 'The cat was outside' can be rewritten as 'cat\\_outside'. Given these two premises, the conclusion 'The dog was inside' or 'dog\\_inside' follows logically.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
