It's structure is: if P, then Q; Q; therefore, P. \n\nThe logical validity of an argument doesn't depend on its content, but on its form. In this case, the form is that of a hypothetical syllogism, which is valid. \n\nHowever, the validity of an argument does not guarantee its soundness. Soundness requires both validity and true premises. Here, while the premises might be true or false, we have no information to determine that. We're only considering the logical form of the argument.\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid."
