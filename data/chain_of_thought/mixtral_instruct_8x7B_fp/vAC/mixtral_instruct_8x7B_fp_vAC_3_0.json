Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, P represents 'the book was written by James' and Q represents 'the book is a mystery novel'. \n\nThe problem with this form of argument is that there could be other possible conditions that lead to Q being true. For example, the book could be a mystery novel even if it was written by someone other than James. \n\nTherefore, even if the second premise is true (the book is a mystery novel), it does not necessarily follow that the first premise is true (the book was written by James). There could be other possible explanations for why the book is a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: No."
