It's possible that the snizzle could be glorp, or any other number of things. However, just based on this statement alone, we cannot definitively say that \"The snizzle might be glorp or zazzle\" because the statement \"The snizzle might be zazzle\" does not explicitly mention glorp. It would depend on the context and other information provided.\n\nAnswer: No."
