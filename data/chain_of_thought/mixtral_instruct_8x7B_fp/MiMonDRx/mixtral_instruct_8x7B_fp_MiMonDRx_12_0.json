The statement 'The gronk might be zazzle or flimble' is a more general statement that includes the possibility that the gronk is flimble, but also allows for the possibility that the gronk is zazzle. Without further information, we cannot infer that the gronk can only be flimble and not zazzle, so we cannot make the jump from the first statement to the second.\n\nAnswer: No."
