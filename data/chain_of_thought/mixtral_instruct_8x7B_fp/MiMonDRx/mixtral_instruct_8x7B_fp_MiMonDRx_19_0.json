The term \"might be\" indicates a possibility, not a certainty. \n\nIf we want to infer that the flonk could be either frazzle or grazzle, we would need to interpret \"The flonk might be grazzle\" as meaning that the only possible states for the flonk are frazzle and grazzle, and it's currently in the grazzle state. However, this is an interpretation that goes beyond what's directly stated in the original sentence.\n\nThe original sentence does not exclude the possibility of the flonk being in other states besides grazzle. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that \"The flonk might be frazzle or be grazzle\".\n\nAnswer: No."
