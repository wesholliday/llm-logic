It does not exclude the possibility of the frazzle being a quork. However, the statement does not provide enough information to confirm that the frazzle could be a quork. It only confirms the possibility of it being a snork. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The frazzle might be quork or snork' based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
