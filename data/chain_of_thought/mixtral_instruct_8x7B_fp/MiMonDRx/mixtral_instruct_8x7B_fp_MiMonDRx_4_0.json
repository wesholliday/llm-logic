However, it does not exclude the possibility of other identities for the fizzle. Shimble could be another possible identity for the fizzle. Without further context, we cannot definitively say whether 'The fizzle might be shimble or glorp' is true.\n\nAnswer: Not certainly. The statement 'The fizzle might be glorp' does not provide enough information to infer that 'The fizzle might be shimble or glorp'."
