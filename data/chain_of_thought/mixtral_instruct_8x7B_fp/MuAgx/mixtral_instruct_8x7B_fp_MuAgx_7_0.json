            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The quazzle must be zibble and it must frazzle froodle zooble\" contains two independent clauses: \"The quazzle must be zibble\" and \"it must frazzle froodle zooble.\" These clauses are connected by the conjunction \"and.\" \n\nWhen we remove the repeated words \"it must\" from the second clause, we are left with \"frazzle froodle zooble,\" which still maintains the original meaning of the second clause. The subject of the second clause is implied, and since the two clauses are connected by \"and,\" it is understood that both actions apply to the same subject - the quazzle.\n\nTherefore, the shortened version \"The quazzle must be zibble and frazzle froodle zooble\" conveys the same meaning as the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
