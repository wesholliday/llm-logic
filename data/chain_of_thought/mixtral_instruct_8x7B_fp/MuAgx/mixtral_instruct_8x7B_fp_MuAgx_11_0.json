            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The glorp must be wobble and it must be zooble\" is composed of two requirements: the glorp must be wobble, and the glorp must be zooble. The proposed inferred statement \"The glorp must be wobble and zooble\" removes the repeated \"it must be\" from the original statement. However, this does not affect the meaning of the individual requirements. Therefore, based on the information given, we can infer that \"The glorp must be wobble and zooble\" is a valid inference.\nAnswer: Yes."
