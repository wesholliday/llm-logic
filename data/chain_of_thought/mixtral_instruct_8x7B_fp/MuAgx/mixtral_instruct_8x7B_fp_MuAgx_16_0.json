These are connected by the word \"and\", which means both conditions must be met. \n\nWhen we remove the repeated phrase \"it must\" from the original statement, the meaning does not change because we're still conveying the same two requirements. The word \"and\" still connects these two requirements.\n\nSo, yes, from the original statement, we can infer 'The flibbit must be quibble crunk and snork zooble wozzle'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
