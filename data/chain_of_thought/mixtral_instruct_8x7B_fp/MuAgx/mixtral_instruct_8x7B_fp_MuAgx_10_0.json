            "content": "Explanation: The given statement \"The plonk must be wibble and it must be wibble\" actually repeats the same information twice, once in the middle of the sentence and once at the end. The phrase \"it must be wibble\" is redundant because it repeats the same information as \"The plonk must be wibble.\" Therefore, the sentence can be simplified to \"The plonk must be wibble.\"\n\nThe original statement also includes the word \"and\" between \"wibble\" and \"it must be wibble,\" which is unnecessary because \"it must be wibble\" is just a repetition of \"wibble.\" Therefore, the word \"and\" can be removed from the statement.\n\nSo, the simplified and corrected version of the statement would be \"The plonk must be wibble.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes."
