            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The plimp must be fizzle snork and it must blimp frazzle\" contains two independent clauses: \"The plimp must be fizzle snork\" and \"it must blimp frazzle\". The first clause is stating that the plimp's identity or nature is fizzle snork. The second clause is stating that the plimp must perform an action, which is to blimp frazzle. \n\nWhen we remove the word 'it' from \"and it must blimp frazzle\", we are simply joining the two clauses together with a conjunction 'and'. This does not change the meaning of the original statement, because the subject 'the plimp' is already mentioned in the first clause. The revised statement \"The plimp must be fizzle snork and blimp frazzle\" still conveys the same meaning as the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
