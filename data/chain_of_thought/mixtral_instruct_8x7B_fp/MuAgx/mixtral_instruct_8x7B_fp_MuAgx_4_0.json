            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The quorple must be at snork gribble and it must be in the wibble plonk\" contains two separate clauses: \"The quorple must be at snork gribble\" and \"it must be in the wibble plonk.\" The first clause is specifying the location of the quorple as being at snork gribble, while the second clause is specifying that the quorple must also be in the wibble plonk.\n\nThe suggested statement \"The quorple must be at snork gribble and in the wibble plonk\" combines both of these clauses into one, using the conjunction \"and\" to connect the two location specifications.\n\nIn this case, the suggested statement is a more concise and grammatically correct way of expressing the same idea as the original statement. Therefore, we can infer that the suggested statement is true based on the information given in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
