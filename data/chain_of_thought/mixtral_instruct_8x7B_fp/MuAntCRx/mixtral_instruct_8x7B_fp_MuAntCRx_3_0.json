However, there is no information in the given phrase that suggests any connection between \"fribble quorple\" and \"the wobble\" or any other actions related to \"the wobble.\" Therefore, we cannot infer that \"the wobble\" must \"fribble quorple and frozz fizzle\" based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No."
