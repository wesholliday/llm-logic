The gribble might be blimple, and this blimpling is caused by flim. Alternatively, the gribble might be grooble.\n2. The gribble might be blimple by flim, or it might be blimple by grooble.\n\nHowever, the first interpretation is unlikely because it implies that \"blimple\" is a state that the gribble can be in, and that \"flim\" and \"grooble\" are causes of this state. This interpretation is inconsistent with the information provided in the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the second interpretation is more likely, which means that the original statement is equivalent to \"The gribble might be blimple by flim or it might be blimple by grooble\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
