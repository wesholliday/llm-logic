The statement suggests that there are only two possibilities for the frazzle: it might be snizzle, or it might be blurble, but not both.\n\nThe statement \"The frazzle might be snizzle or it might be blurble\" is a more explicit form of expressing the same idea. It spells out the two possibilities separately, making it clear that there are only two options and that they are mutually exclusive.\n\nTherefore, the two statements are logically equivalent, and the second statement is a valid inference from the first.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
