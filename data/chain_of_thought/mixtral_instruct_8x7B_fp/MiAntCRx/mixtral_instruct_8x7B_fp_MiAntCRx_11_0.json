However, this does not necessarily exclude the possibility that the bimboozle might also have properties or characteristics that are similar to or associated with the quazzle.\n\nIn other words, the first statement only makes a claim about the relationship between the bimboozle and the wumble, but it does not make any explicit claims about the relationship between the bimboozle and the quazzle. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is possible that the bimboozle might be both a wumble and a quazzle.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
