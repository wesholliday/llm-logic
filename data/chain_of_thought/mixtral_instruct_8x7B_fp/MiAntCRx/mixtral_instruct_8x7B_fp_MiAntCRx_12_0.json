It does not exclude the possibility of the blimple having other qualities. Therefore, if we are told that the blimple might be frozz as well, it would not contradict the initial statement. In fact, it would simply add another possibility to the characteristics of the blimple.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer 'The blimple might be frozz and quank'."
