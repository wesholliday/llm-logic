However, it does not give us any information about other possible actions such as 'plimp'. In order to infer that 'The blurble might plimp and floob', we would need additional information that connects 'blurble' with 'plimp'. Without this information, we cannot make the inference that 'The blurble might plimp and floob'. Answer: No."
