It means that based on the information available, it's plausible that a grooble could be a zooble. However, this does not exclude other possibilities.\n\nThe statement does not deny the possibility of a grooble being frozz or anything else. Therefore, based on the given information, it is possible to infer that \"The grooble might be frozz and zooble\". This doesn't mean that a grooble is definitely frozz and zooble, but rather that it's possible.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
