A disjunctive syllogism is valid when it follows this pattern:\n\nPremise 1: P or Q\nPremise 2: Not-P\nConclusion: Q\n\nIn this argument, the first premise asserts that either the sunglasses are in her bag (P) or they must be perched on her head (Q). The second premise denies that the sunglasses must be perched on her head (Not-P). Therefore, the conclusion asserts that the sunglasses must be in her bag (Q).\n\nThe argument follows the pattern of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid form of argument.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
