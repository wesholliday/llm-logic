A disjunctive syllogism has the following form:\n\nPremise 1: P or Q\nPremise 2: Not-Q\nConclusion: Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, the first premise asserts that either the keys are in the drawer (P) or they must be dangling in the cabinet (Q). The second premise denies that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet (not-Q). Therefore, the conclusion asserts that the keys are in the drawer (P).\n\nSince this argument follows the form of a valid disjunctive syllogism, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
