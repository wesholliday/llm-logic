A disjunctive syllogism has the following form:\n\nPremise 1: P or Q\nPremise 2: Not-P\nConclusion: Q\n\nIn this case, the first premise asserts that the milk is either on the counter (P) or chilling in the fridge (Q). The second premise denies that the milk must be chilling in the fridge (Not-Q). Therefore, by the rules of disjunctive syllogism, we can infer that the milk must be on the counter (P).\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
