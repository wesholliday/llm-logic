A disjunctive syllogism has the following form:\n\nPremise 1: P or Q\nPremise 2: Not-P\nConclusion: Q\n\nIn this case, the first premise asserts that either the shoes are in the closet (P) or they must be lined up by the door (Q). The second premise denies that the shoes must be lined up by the door (Not-P). Therefore, according to the rules of disjunctive syllogism, we can infer that the shoes are in the closet (Q).\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
