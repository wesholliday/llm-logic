A disjunctive syllogism has the following general structure:\n\nPremise 1: P or Q\nPremise 2: Not-P\nConclusion: Therefore, Q\n\nIn this case, the first premise asserts that the missing puzzle piece is either in the box (P) or blending in on the floor (Q). The second premise denies that the missing piece is blending in on the floor (Not-P). Therefore, the conclusion asserts that the missing puzzle piece must be in the box (Q).\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
