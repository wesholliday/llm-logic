            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is an example of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. A disjunctive syllogism consists of a disjunction (an 'or' statement) and the negation of one of the disjuncts, leading to the conclusion that the other disjunct must be true. In this case, the first premise presents a disjunction between the pen being in the bag and the pen having to be on the desk. The second premise negates the second disjunct, stating that it's not the case that the pen must be on the desk. Therefore, based on the rules of disjunctive syllogism, we can conclude that the pen must be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
