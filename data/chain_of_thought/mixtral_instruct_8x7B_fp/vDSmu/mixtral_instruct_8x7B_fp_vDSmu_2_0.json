A disjunctive syllogism has the following form:\n\nPremise 1: P or Q\nPremise 2: Not-P\nConclusion: Q\n\nIn this case, the first premise asserts that the book is either on the shelf (P) or on the table (Q). The second premise denies that the book must be on the table (not-Q). Therefore, by the rules of disjunctive syllogism, we can infer that the book must be on the shelf (P).\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
