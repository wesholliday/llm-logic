A disjunctive syllogism has the following form:\n\nPremise 1: P or Q\nPremise 2: Not-Q\nConclusion: Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, the first premise asserts that the phone is either in the living room (P) or ringing in the kitchen (Q). The second premise denies that the phone is ringing in the kitchen (not-Q). Therefore, by the rules of disjunctive syllogism, we can conclude that the phone must be in the living room (P).\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
