            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is an example of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. A disjunctive syllogism consists of a disjunction (an 'or' statement) and the negation of one of the disjuncts, leading to the conclusion that the other disjunct must be true. In this case, the first premise presents a disjunction between the scarf being in the backpack and it being on the coat rack. The second premise negates the second disjunct, stating that the scarf is not on the coat rack. Therefore, the conclusion that the scarf is in the backpack follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
