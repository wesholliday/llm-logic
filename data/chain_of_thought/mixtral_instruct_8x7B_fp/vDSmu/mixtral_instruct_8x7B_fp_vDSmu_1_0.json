A disjunctive syllogism has the following form:\n\nPremise 1: P or Q\nPremise 2: Not-P\nConclusion: Q\n\nIn this case, the first premise asserts that Fido is either inside (P) or in the garden (Q). The second premise denies that Fido must be in the garden (Not-Q). Therefore, by the rules of disjunctive syllogism, we can infer that Fido is inside (P).\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
