            "content": "Explanation: This is a conditional statement, often referred to as 'if p then q'. In this case, 'p' represents 'the car was red' and 'q' represents 'the truck was blue'. \n\nThe statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' is true when either 'p' is true and 'q' is true, or when 'p' is false and 'q' is true, or when both 'p' and 'q' are false. It's also true if 'p' is false and we don't know the truth value of 'q'. However, it's not true when 'p' is false and 'q' is false, nor when 'p' is true and 'q' is false.\n\nGiven that 'The truck was blue' (q) is true, it could be because 'the car was red' (p) is true. But it could also be because 'the car was not red' and we have no information about the color of the car. So, from the given information, we cannot definitively say that 'the car was red' is true.\n\nAnswer: No."
