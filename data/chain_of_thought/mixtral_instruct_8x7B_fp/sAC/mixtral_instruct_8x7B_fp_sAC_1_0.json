The statement 'Sue was at the wedding' is given as true, which is the consequent q in our conditional statement. To determine if Mary was at the wedding, we need to use Modus Ponens, a valid rule of inference in classical logic, which states that from 'if p, then q' and p, we can infer q. However, in this case, we are trying to infer p (Mary was at the wedding) from 'if p, then q' and q (Sue was at the wedding). This is not logically valid and is an example of the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nAnswer: No."
