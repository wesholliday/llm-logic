            "content": "Explanation: This is a conditional statement, often referred to as \"if p then q\". In this case, p is \"Joe went to the park\" and q is \"Lucy went to the zoo\". \n\nThe statement 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' is true when both conditions are true or when the condition of the if-statement (p) is false. This is known as material implication in logic.\n\nWe are given that 'Lucy went to the zoo' is true. If 'Lucy went to the zoo' is true, then the whole statement 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' could be true if Joe also went to the park. However, it could also be true if Joe didn't go to the park, because the statement is still true when its condition is false.\n\nBut in this case, we are also told that 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' is true. Therefore, if 'Lucy went to the zoo' is true, then 'Joe went to the park' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
