The statement 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' means that the truth of 'the cake was chocolate' (referred to as p) guarantees the truth of 'the muffins were blueberry' (referred to as q). \n\nHowever, the truth of 'the muffins were blueberry' does not guarantee the truth of 'the cake was chocolate'. This is because there could be other reasons why the muffins were blueberry, not necessarily because the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: No."
