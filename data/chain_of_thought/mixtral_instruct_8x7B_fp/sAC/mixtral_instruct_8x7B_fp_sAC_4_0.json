There could be other reasons why the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nHowever, in this case, since the given statement is a material conditional, if the premise \"The robot visited Jupiter\" is true, and it is known that this is the effect of the cause \"The alien visited Mars\", then we can infer that the cause must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
