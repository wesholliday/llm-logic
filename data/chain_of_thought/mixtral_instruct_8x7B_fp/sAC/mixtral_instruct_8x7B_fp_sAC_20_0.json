Given that this conditional statement is true, and that the statement 'the banana was yellow' is also true, we cannot definitively conclude that 'the apple was red' is true. This is because even if the conclusion is true, the truth of the conditional statement does not guarantee the truth of its condition. It is possible that the condition is false, and the apple was not red, but something else.\nAnswer: No."
