However, we cannot directly conclude that the vampire was awake as well, because the truth of the mummy being awake does not necessarily imply the vampire being awake. It only gives us a condition under which the vampire would be awake. Without knowing if this condition was met, we cannot definitively say that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: No."
