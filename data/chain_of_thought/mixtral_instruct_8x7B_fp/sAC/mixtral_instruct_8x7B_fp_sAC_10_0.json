This means that if the condition (the dog being inside) is true, then the consequence (the cat being outside) is also true. \n\nThe statement \"The cat was outside\" matches the consequence of our conditional statement. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the dog was inside. It's possible that the dog was outside as well. \n\nBut according to the given information, \"The cat was outside\" is true, and the conditional statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" is true. If the cat being outside is a result of the dog being inside, then yes, the dog was inside. But if the cat being outside is not related to the dog's location, then no, we cannot conclude that the dog was inside.\n\nAnswer: We cannot definitively say 'yes' or 'no' without additional information about the relationship between the cat's location and the dog's location."
