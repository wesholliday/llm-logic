            "content": "Explanation: This is a conditional statement, often written as \"If P, then Q\". The statement 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad' means that the eating of pasta by Ben is the cause or condition for the eating of salad by Kate. \n\nSymbolically, we can represent this as:\nP (Ben ate pasta)\nQ (Kate ate salad)\n\nThe truth table for this conditional statement would look like this:\n\nP | Q | P -> Q\n-----------------\nT | T | T\nT | F | F\nF | T | T\nF | F | T\n\nFrom this, we can see that even if Q (Kate ate salad) is true, P (Ben ate pasta) can still be false. However, if the statement 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad' is true and 'Kate ate salad' is true, then for consistency, 'Ben ate pasta' must also be true. This is because a true conditional statement can only be false when the condition (P) is true but the result (Q) is false.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
