            "content": "Explanation: This question is a application of logical reasoning, specifically using the concept of conditional statements and logical equivalences.  The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" can be written in logical notation as: Tom \u2192 Jen, where \"Tom\" represents \"Tom watched football\" and \"Jen\" represents \"Jen watched basketball\". \n\nGiven that \"Jen watched basketball\" is true, we know that Jen = T. \n\nTo determine if \"Tom watched football\" is true, we need to evaluate Tom. According to the truth table for the conditional statement (Tom \u2192 Jen), Tom is true only if Jen is also true. Since we know that Jen is true, it follows that Tom must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
