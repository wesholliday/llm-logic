            "content": "Explanation: This is a conditional statement where if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This is represented as: Alex -> Chris. We are given that this statement is true. We are also given that the statement \"Chris finished the race\" is true. To determine if \"Alex finished the race\" is true, we can use a truth table or logical reasoning. If Alex -> Chris is true and Chris is true, then Alex can be either true or false. However, since the statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" implies that if Alex finished, then Chris must have finished as well, it is not possible for Alex to be false and the statement to be true. Therefore, if Chris finished the race, then Alex must have finished the race as well.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
