According to this statement, if the condition (shirt is cotton) is true, then the consequence (pants are denim) must also be true. \n\nHowever, this conditional statement does not claim anything about the situation when the condition is false. It doesn't say that if the pants are denim, then the shirt must be cotton. It only specifies the direction from the shirt to the pants, not the other way around.\n\nGiven that 'The pants were denim' is true, we cannot conclude that 'The shirt was cotton' is true based on this information alone. We need to check the condition of the shirt to make this conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No."
