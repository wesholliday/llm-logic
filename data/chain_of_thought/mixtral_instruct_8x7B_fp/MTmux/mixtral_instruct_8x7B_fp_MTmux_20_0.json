If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned. (We'll denote this as P -> Q)\n2. It's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned. (~Q)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer that the fleeg was not bluttered (~P).\n\nTo do this, we can use modus tollens, which states that if P -> Q is true, and ~Q is true, then ~P must be true. \n\nIn this case, ~Q is given as a fact, and our conditional statement is P -> Q. If the fleeg being bluttered implies that it must have been surned, and it's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned, then it follows that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
