            "content": "Explanation: This question involves logical reasoning using the concept of contrapositive. The original statement \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated\" can be written in logical form as \"P -> Q\", where P represents \"the flob was skizzled\" and Q represents \"the flob must have movated\". The negation of the statement \"the flob must have movated\" is given as \"it's not the case that the flob must have movated\", which can be written in logical form as ~Q.\n\nTo infer that \"the flob was not skizzled\" (~P), we can use the concept of contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \"P -> Q\" is \"~Q -> ~P\". In other words, if the conclusion of a statement is negated, then the negation of the original hypothesis is inferred.\n\nTherefore, if we negate the conclusion \"the flob must have movated\" to \"it's not the case that the flob must have movated\" (~Q), we can infer the negation of the original hypothesis \"the flob was skizzled\" (~P), which means \"the flob was not skizzled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
