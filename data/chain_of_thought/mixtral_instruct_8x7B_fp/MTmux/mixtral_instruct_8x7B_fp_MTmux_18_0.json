            "content": "Explanation: This question involves logical reasoning and the concept of contrapositive. The statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged\" can be rewritten as \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nGiven that \"It's not the case that the shank must have been nugged,\" we can infer that the shank was not nugged. Using the contrapositive, if the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"The shank was not plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes."
