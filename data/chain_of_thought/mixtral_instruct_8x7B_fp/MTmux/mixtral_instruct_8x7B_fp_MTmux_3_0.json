            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical inference and the concept of contrapositive in formal logic. The original conditional statement \"if the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked\" can be written in logical notation as \"P -> Q\", where P represents \"the splat was morphed\" and Q represents \"the splat must have quanked\". The negation of the second statement, \"it's not the case that the splat must have quanked\", can be written as \"~Q\". The question asks whether we can infer \"the splat was not morphed\", or \"~P\", from these two statements.\n\nTo answer this question, we can use the concept of contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"P -> Q\" is the statement \"~Q -> ~P\". This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. In this case, the contrapositive of \"P -> Q\" is \"~Q -> ~P\", or \"if the splat must not have quanked, then the splat was not morphed\". Since we know that \"it's not the case that the splat must have quanked\", or \"~Q\", we can infer that \"the splat was not morphed\", or \"~P\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
