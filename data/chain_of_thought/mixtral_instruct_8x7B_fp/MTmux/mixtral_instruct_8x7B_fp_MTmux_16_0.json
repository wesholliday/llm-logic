            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical inference and the concept of contrapositive in logic. The original statement \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink\" can be written in logical notation as \"C -> S\", where C represents \"the sneg was crampled\" and S represents \"the sneg sproted the frink\". The negation of the second statement \"It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink\" can be written as \"~S\". The question asks if we can infer \"The sneg was not crampled\", or \"~C\", from these two statements.\n\nTo answer this question, we can use the concept of contrapositive in logic. The contrapositive of a statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". The contrapositive of the original statement \"C -> S\" is \"~S -> ~C\". This means that if the sneg did not sprot the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\n\nSince we are given that \"It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink\", or \"~S\", we can infer from the contrapositive that \"The sneg was not crampled\", or \"~C\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
