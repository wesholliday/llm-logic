The statement \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been spened\" is a negation of the consequence of the conditional statement, which means that the consequence is false.\n\nIf the consequence is false, then the conditional statement is not true. This means that the condition (the dreb was vroombed) cannot be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The dreb was not vroombed\".\n\nAnswer: Yes."
