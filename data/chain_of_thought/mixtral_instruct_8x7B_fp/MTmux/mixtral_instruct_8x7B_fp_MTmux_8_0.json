            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical reasoning, specifically whether we can make a certain deduction based on the given information. The statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled' is a conditional statement, often referred to as 'if p then q'. The second statement 'It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled' is the negation of a necessity statement, which can be rephrased as 'The sprocket does not necessarily have to be daggled' or 'It's possible that the sprocket is not daggled', which is logically equivalent to 'It's possible that the sprocket was not cranked' (given the first statement). \n\nSince it's possible that the sprocket was not cranked, and there is no information suggesting that the sprocket was cranked but not daggled, we can indeed infer that 'The sprocket was not cranked'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
