            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked' is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the fribble was snurgled) is true, then the consequence (the fribble must have crinked) must also be true. The statement 'It's not the case that the fribble must have crinked' is the negation of the consequence of the conditional statement, which means that the consequence is false. Therefore, the condition must be false as well, because if the condition were true, then the consequence would also have to be true. So we can infer that 'The fribble was not snurgled'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
