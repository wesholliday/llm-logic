            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled\" is a conditional statement, often denoted as \"if P then Q\". This statement means that if the condition P (flugel being blimmed) is true, then the consequence Q (flugel must have been zargled) must also be true.\n\nThe second statement is \"It's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled\", which negates the consequence Q from the first statement. This can be denoted as \"not Q\".\n\nNow, we want to infer if \"The flugel was not blimmed\", denoted as \"not P\".\n\nTo do this, we apply logical reasoning using contrapositive. The contrapositive of an if-then statement \"if P then Q\" is \"if not Q then not P\". This means that if the consequence Q is false, then the condition P must also be false.\n\nIn this case, since \"not Q\" (it's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled) is true, we can infer \"not P\" (the flugel was not blimmed).\n\nAnswer: Yes"
