It's not the case that the whiffle must have tinked. This means that tinked is not true, or ~Tinked.\n\nWe want to find out if we can conclude ~Shanked (the whiffle was not shanked) from these statements.\n\nAccording to the first statement, if Shanked is true, then Tinked must also be true. However, the second statement tells us that ~Tinked is true. Therefore, Shanked cannot be true because if it were, Tinked would also have to be true, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nSince Shanked cannot be true, it means that ~Shanked is true. So, we can indeed infer that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
