            "content": "Explanation: This is a logical reasoning question that involves evaluating a conditional statement and applying modus ponens, a rule of inference in logic. The statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' is a conditional statement, often denoted as 'Sam took a plane \u2192 Erin took a train'. The second piece of information given is 'Erin took a train', which is the consequent of our conditional statement. Modus ponens states that if you have a conditional statement and its consequent, you can infer the antecedent. In this case, the antecedent is 'Sam took a plane'. Therefore, since we have the conditional statement and its consequent, we can indeed logically infer the antecedent, 'Sam took a plane'.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
