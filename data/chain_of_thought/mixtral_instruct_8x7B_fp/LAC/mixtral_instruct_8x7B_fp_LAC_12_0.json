If the statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is true, and we know that \"Lucy went to the zoo\" (q is true), then it could be the case that Joe went to the park (p is true) in order for the conditional statement to be true. However, we cannot definitively conclude that Joe went to the park. It's possible that Lucy went to the zoo for some other reason, not because Joe went to the park. This is known as affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy in logic.\n\nAnswer: No."
