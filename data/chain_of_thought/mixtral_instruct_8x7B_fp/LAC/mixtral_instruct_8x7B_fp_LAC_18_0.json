            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument known as a conditional statement. The first part, \"If the doll was plastic,\" is the condition. The second part, \"then the truck was metal,\" is the consequence. This statement allows us to make an inference when given that the truck was metal. Since the condition (the doll being plastic) corresponds to the truck being metal, and we know that the truck is metal, it is logical to infer that the condition (the doll being plastic) must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
