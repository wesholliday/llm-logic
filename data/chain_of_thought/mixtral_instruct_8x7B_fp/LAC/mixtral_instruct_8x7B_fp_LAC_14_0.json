            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical inference, specifically whether we can use Modus Ponens, a valid rule of inference in classical logic. The rule states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, we can infer that Q is also true.\n\nIn this case, the given statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" is the conditional statement, and \"The wolf was in the den\" is known to be true. We want to infer \"The bear was in the cave\", which is the consequent of the conditional statement.\n\nTo determine if we can logically infer \"The bear was in the cave\", we need to check if the given statement \"The wolf was in the den\" matches the antecedent of the conditional statement. In this case, it does.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
