            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument in the form of a conditional statement, often called \"modus ponens.\" The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is the conditional statement, also known as a hypothetical or implication. The second statement, \"The truck was blue,\" is the consequent of the conditional statement.\n\nHowever, even though the consequent is true, it does not necessarily mean that the car was red. There could be other reasons why the truck was blue, unrelated to the color of the car. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that the car was red based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: No."
