            "content": "Explanation: This is a question about logical inference and specifically, it's testing whether we can apply the rule of transitive inference here. The rule of transitive inference states that if A implies B and B is true, then A must be true. \n\nIn this case, the statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis' can be broken down into 'Jeff played basketball' implies 'Amy played tennis'. And the second statement is 'Amy played tennis'. \n\nSo, applying the rule of transitive inference, since 'Jeff played basketball' implies 'Amy played tennis', and 'Amy played tennis' is true, it would logically follow that 'Jeff played basketball' is also true.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this kind of logical inference only holds if the original conditional statement is true in the first place. Here, we're assuming the truth of the statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis', which may not necessarily be the case in reality.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
