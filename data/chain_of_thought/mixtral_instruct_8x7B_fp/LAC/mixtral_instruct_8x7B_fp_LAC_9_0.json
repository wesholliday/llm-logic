            "content": "Explanation: This is a logical reasoning question that follows the structure of a conditional statement, also known as if-then statement. The statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is in the form of \"p -> q\", where \"p\" is the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) and \"q\" is the consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt). \n\nGiven the second statement \"Mark bought the blue shirt\", which is the consequence in our original if-then statement, we can use logical reasoning to see if the condition is necessarily true. \n\nIn this case, the statement 'Mark bought the blue shirt' does not necessarily mean that 'Lisa bought the red shirt' is true. Mark could have bought the blue shirt for any number of reasons, and Lisa's purchase is not guaranteed. However, if the statement was 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt', then the answer would be yes.\n\nAnswer: No."
