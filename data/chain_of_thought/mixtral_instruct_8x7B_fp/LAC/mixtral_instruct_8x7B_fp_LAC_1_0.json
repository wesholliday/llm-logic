This means that the truth of P guarantees the truth of Q but the truth of Q does not guarantee the truth of P (it could be that Sue was at the wedding for some other reason).\n\nHowever, given that Sue was at the wedding, there are two possibilities: either Mary was at the wedding as well, or she wasn't. We don't know which one it is based on the information provided. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No."
