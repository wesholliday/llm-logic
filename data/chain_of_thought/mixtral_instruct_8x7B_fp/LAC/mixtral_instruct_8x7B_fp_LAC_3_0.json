            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of logical reasoning using if-then statements, also known as conditional statements. The original statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is in the form of a conditional statement P -> Q, where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel\". \n\nThe second statement \"The book is a mystery novel\" is equivalent to Q. We want to find out if we can infer P from Q and the original conditional statement. \n\nTo do this, we need to understand that if P implies Q, then the only way to guarantee Q is if P is true. This is known as modus ponens in logical reasoning. However, if we only know that Q is true, it does not necessarily mean that P is true. There could be other reasons why Q is true. \n\nIn this case, just because the book is a mystery novel, it doesn't mean that James wrote it. There could be other authors who write mystery novels. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that \"The book was written by James\".\n\nAnswer: No."
