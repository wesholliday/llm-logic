            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument in the form of a conditional statement, often referred to as \"modus ponens.\" The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is the conditional statement, also known as the 'if-then' statement. The second statement, \"The banana was yellow,\" is the confirmation of the result, if the condition was true. However, the 'if-then' statement does not necessarily mean that the apple's color causes the banana to be yellow. It only means that in this particular scenario, if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nThe crucial point here is that we do not have any information that contradicts the 'if-then' statement. Therefore, since the condition (the banana being yellow) is true, it is indeed logically sound to infer that the original condition (the apple being red) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
