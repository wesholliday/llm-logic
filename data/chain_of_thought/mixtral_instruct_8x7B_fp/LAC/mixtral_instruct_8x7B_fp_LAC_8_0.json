            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of logical reasoning using conditional statements. The statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is in the form of a conditional statement, often called a hypothesis. The second statement given is 'The mummy was awake', which is called the conclusion. In logic, we can use a rule called Modus Ponens to infer that if both the hypothesis and the conclusion are true, then the antecedent (the part before 'then') must also be true. In this case, the antecedent is 'The vampire was awake'. So using Modus Ponens, since the mummy being awake is true, and if the vampire being awake implies the mummy being awake, then the vampire being awake must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
