            "content": "Explanation: This statement is an example of a logical conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\". The first statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' can be written as \"If P, then Q\". Here, P represents 'Tom watched football' and Q represents 'Jen watched basketball'. \n\nThe second statement given is 'Jen watched basketball', which is the consequent of our original conditional statement. However, just because the consequent is true, it doesn't necessarily mean the antecedent (P) is also true. For example, there could be other reasons why Jen was watching basketball, not just because Tom was watching football. So, we cannot definitively conclude that Tom watched football based on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: No."
