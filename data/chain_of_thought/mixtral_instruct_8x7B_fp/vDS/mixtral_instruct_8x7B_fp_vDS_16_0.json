            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is an example of a logical argument structure called a disjunctive syllogism. A disjunctive syllogism is an argument with two premises. The first premise is a disjunction, which means it is a statement that presents two alternatives as exhaustive and exclusive (only one of the alternatives can be true). The second premise is a denial of one of the alternatives presented in the disjunction. The conclusion then follows that the remaining alternative must be true.\n\nIn this specific argument, the first premise 'Either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk' is a disjunction, presenting two alternatives: the pen being in the bag or the pen being on the desk. The second premise 'The pen isn't on my desk' denies one of those alternatives. Therefore, the conclusion 'The pen is in my bag' follows logically, since if the pen is not on the desk, then it must be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
