            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is an example of a logical reasoning technique called disjunctive syllogism. A disjunctive syllogism is an argument in which the premises are a disjunction (a logical term for 'either or') and the negation of one of the disjuncts. In this case, the disjunction is 'The missing sock is in the laundry basket or it's under the bed', and the negation of one of the disjuncts is 'The missing sock isn't under the bed'. The conclusion is then drawn that the missing sock must be in the laundry basket.\n\nThe logical validity of this form of argument can be demonstrated through a truth table. A truth table is a table that lists all possible combinations of true or false values for the propositions in an argument and shows whether the argument is valid (i.e., the conclusion must be true if the premises are true) or invalid (i.e., the conclusion may be false even if the premises are true).\n\nFor a disjunctive syllogism, the truth table would look like this:\n\n| Premise 1: A v B | Premise 2: \u00acA | Conclusion: B |\n|---|---|---|\n| T | F | T |\n| T | T | T |\n| F | F | F |\n| F | T | F |\n\nIn this table, A represents 'The missing sock is under the bed' and B represents 'The missing sock is in the laundry basket'. The symbol 'v' represents 'or', and the symbol '\u00ac' represents 'not'. The first column lists all possible true or false values for the first premise, the second column lists all possible true or false values for the second premise, and the third column lists the corresponding true or false values for the conclusion.\n\nAs you can see, in every row where both premises are true (rows 2 and 4), the conclusion is also true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
