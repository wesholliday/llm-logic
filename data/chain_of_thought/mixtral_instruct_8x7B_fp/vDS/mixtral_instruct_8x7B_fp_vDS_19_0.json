            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is an example of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. A disjunctive syllogism consists of a disjunction (an 'or' statement) and the negation of one of the disjuncts (one of the 'or' options). The conclusion is then drawn that the other disjunct must be true.\n\nIn this case, the first premise presents a disjunction: the watch is either charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist. The second premise negates one of the disjuncts by stating that the watch is not on his wrist. Therefore, according to the rules of a disjunctive syllogism, we can validly infer that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
