            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is an example of a logical reasoning technique called \"disjunctive syllogism.\" A disjunctive syllogism is an argument in which the premises are a disjunction (an 'or' statement) and the negation of one of the disjuncts, and the conclusion is the remaining disjunct. \n\nIn this case, the first premise presents us with a disjunction: the toy is either in the toy box or on the shelf. The second premise negates one of these disjuncts, stating that the toy is not on the shelf. Therefore, based on the rules of disjunctive syllogism, we can validly infer that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
