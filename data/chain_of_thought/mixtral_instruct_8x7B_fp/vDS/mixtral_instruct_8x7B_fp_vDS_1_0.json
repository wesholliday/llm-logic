A disjunctive syllogism has the form:\n\nPremise 1: P or Q\nPremise 2: Not-P\nConclusion: Q\n\nIn this case, the first premise asserts that Fido is either inside (P) or in the garden (Q). The second premise asserts that Fido is not in the garden (Not-P). Therefore, the conclusion must be that Fido is inside (Q).\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
