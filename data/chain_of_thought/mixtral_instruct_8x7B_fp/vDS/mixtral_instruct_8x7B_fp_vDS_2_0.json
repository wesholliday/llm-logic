            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is an example of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. A disjunctive syllogism consists of a disjunction (an 'or' statement) followed by the negation of one of the disjuncts, leading to the affirmation of the other disjunct. In this case, the first premise presents a disjunction ('the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table'), the second premise negates one of the disjuncts ('the book isn't resting on the table'), and the conclusion affirms the remaining disjunct ('the book is on the shelf'). Since the argument follows this valid form, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
