            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is an example of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. A disjunctive syllogism consists of a disjunction (an 'or' statement) and the negation of one of the disjuncts (one of the 'or' options). The conclusion is then drawn that the other disjunct must be true.\n\nIn this case, the first premise presents a disjunction: the newspaper is either in the driveway or on the porch. The second premise negates one of the disjuncts by stating that the newspaper is not on the porch. Therefore, according to the rules of a disjunctive syllogism, we can validly conclude that the newspaper must be in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
