            "content": "Explanation: This form of argument is an example of a logical reasoning technique called \"disjunctive syllogism.\" A disjunctive syllogism is a valid form of argument that has two premises. The first premise is a disjunction (an \"or\" statement), and the second premise is the negation of one of the disjuncts (one of the \"or\" parts). The conclusion then asserts the other disjunct.\n\nIn this case, the first premise presents two options: the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry. The second premise negates one of those options by stating that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry. Therefore, based on the rules of disjunctive syllogism, we can logically conclude that the cookies must be in the jar.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid."
