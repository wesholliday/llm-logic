A disjunctive syllogism is valid when it has the form:\n\nPremise 1: P or Q\nPremise 2: Not Q\nConclusion: Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, the first premise asserts that the shoes are either in the closet (P) or lined up by the door (Q). The second premise asserts that the shoes are not lined up by the door (not Q). Therefore, the conclusion must be that the shoes are in the closet (P).\n\nSince this argument follows the form of a valid disjunctive syllogism, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
