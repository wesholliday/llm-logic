When it is rephrased as \"The student might pass the exam and they might fail the exam\", it is simply restating those same two possibilities in a different way. The use of \"and\" instead of \"or\" in the second statement emphasizes that both possibilities are being considered, but it does not change the meaning of the statement. Therefore, the second statement can be inferred from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
