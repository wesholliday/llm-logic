The word \"or\" is used here to indicate that only one of these scenarios will occur.\n\nWhen we infer \"The package might arrive on Monday and it might arrive on Tuesday,\" we are changing the meaning of the original statement. The word \"and\" in this new statement implies that both scenarios could happen simultaneously, which is not the case.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The package might arrive on Monday and it might arrive on Tuesday\" from the original statement because it changes the meaning and implies something different from what was initially stated.\n\nAnswer: No."
