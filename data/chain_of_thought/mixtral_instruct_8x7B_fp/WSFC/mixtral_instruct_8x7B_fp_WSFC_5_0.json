However, the statement 'Sarah might study biology and she might study chemistry' suggests that Sarah is considering studying both subjects, which contradicts the information provided in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that Sarah might study both biology and chemistry based on the original statement.\nAnswer: No."
