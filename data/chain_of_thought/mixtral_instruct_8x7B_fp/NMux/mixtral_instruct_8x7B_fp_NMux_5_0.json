It's saying that it's not required or certain that the zinger was fraggled. \n\nWhen we negate a negative statement, we end up with an affirmative statement. So, \"The zinger might not have been fraggled\" is an affirmative statement that the zinger possibly was not fraggled, which aligns with the original statement's meaning.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
