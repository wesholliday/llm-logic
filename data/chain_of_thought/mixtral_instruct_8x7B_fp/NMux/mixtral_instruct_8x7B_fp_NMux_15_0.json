It's saying that it's not required or compulsory for the dreb to be vroombed.\n\nWhen we negate the necessity of something, we are opening up the possibility of its opposite. In this case, denying that the dreb must have been vroombed implies that there is a possibility that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nSo, the statement \"The dreb might not have been vroombed\" is indeed a valid inference from \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been vroombed\".\n\nAnswer: Yes"
