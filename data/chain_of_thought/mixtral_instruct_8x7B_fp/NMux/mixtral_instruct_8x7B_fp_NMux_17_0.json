It implies that there is a possibility that the flob was not skizzled. \n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"The flob might not have been skizzled\" is expressing a possibility or uncertainty about the flob being skizzled. \n\nSince both statements convey a similar idea of uncertainty or possibility regarding the flob's skizzling, we can infer one from the other.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
