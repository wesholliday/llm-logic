It's saying that it's impossible to say with 100% certainty that the twonk was plinked. \n\nWhen we negate a necessity, we are expressing a possibility. So, the statement can be interpreted as there being a possibility that the twonk was not plinked. \n\nTherefore, the paraphrase \"The twonk might not have been plinked\" is a valid interpretation of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
