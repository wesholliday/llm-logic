It does not confirm or deny whether the fribble was actually snurgled, it only clarifies that it was not required to happen.\n\nThe statement \"The fribble might not have been snurgled\" is expressing uncertainty or the possibility that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nSince both statements express uncertainty or lack of necessity regarding the fribble being snurgled, they are logically equivalent. Therefore, we can infer \"The fribble might not have been snurgled\" from \"It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes"
