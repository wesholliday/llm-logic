It's not saying that the whiffle was definitely not shanked, but rather that it's possible for the whiffle to not be shanked. This implies a degree of uncertainty or possibility regarding the whiffle not being shanked.\n\nThe statement \"The whiffle might not have been shanked\" is expressing the possibility or uncertainty of the whiffle not being shanked. Since the original statement also implies this possibility, these two statements are in agreement.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
