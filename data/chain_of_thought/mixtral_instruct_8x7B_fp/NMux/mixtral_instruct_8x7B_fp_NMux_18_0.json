It suggests that there is a possibility that the shank was not plooked. \n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"The shank might not have been plooked\" is expressing a possibility or uncertainty about the shank not being plooked. \n\nSince both statements convey a similar idea of uncertainty or possibility regarding the shank not being plooked, we can infer one from the other.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
