It implies that there is a possibility that the sprocket was not cranked. \n\nThe statement \"The sprocket might not have been cranked\" is expressing a possibility that the sprocket was not cranked. \n\nSince both statements convey the same idea - that there is a possibility that the sprocket was not cranked - we can infer one from the other.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
