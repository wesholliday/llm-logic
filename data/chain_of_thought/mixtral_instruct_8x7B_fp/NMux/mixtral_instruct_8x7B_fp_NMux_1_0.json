It suggests that there is a possibility that the flugel was not blimmed or that it could have been something else. \n\nOn the other hand, the statement \"The flugel might not have been blimmed\" is expressing uncertainty or possibility about the flugel not being blimmed. \n\nThese two statements convey similar meanings, as both express some level of doubt or possibility regarding the flugel being blimmed. The first statement is negating the idea that the flugel had to be blimmed, while the second statement is directly expressing the possibility of the flugel not being blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
