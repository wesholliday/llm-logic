            "content": "Explanation: The second statement 'The election might require a recount' is simply a part of the first statement 'The election might be close and require a recount'. The possibility of a recount is being implied in both the statements. The word 'close' in the first statement just gives an additional context that the election results are expected to be very similar between the candidates, which might lead to a recount. However, the core idea of a potential recount is already present in the second statement. Therefore, the second statement can be inferred from the first one.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
