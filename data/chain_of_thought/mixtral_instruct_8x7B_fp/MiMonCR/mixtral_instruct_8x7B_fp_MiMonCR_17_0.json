The phrase 'might be improvised' implies that there is a possibility of improvisation, and if there is improvisation, then guest artists could potentially be featured. However, the statement does not explicitly confirm that guest artists will be part of the performance. It only gives a possibility. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the performance will feature guest artists, but we can infer that there is a chance they might be included.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
