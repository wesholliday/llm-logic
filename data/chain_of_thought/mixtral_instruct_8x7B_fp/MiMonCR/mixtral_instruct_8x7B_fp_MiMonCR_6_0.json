            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The investment might be risky and offer high returns' contains two pieces of information: the investment might be risky, and it might offer high returns. The 'might' indicates a possibility, not a certainty. When we consider only the second part of the statement, 'offer high returns', it is still expressing a possibility, not a certainty. Therefore, even if the investment is not risky, it could still offer high returns. So, from the original statement, we can infer that 'The investment might offer high returns'.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
