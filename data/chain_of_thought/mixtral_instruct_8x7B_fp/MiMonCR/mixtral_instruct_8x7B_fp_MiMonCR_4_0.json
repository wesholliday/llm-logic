However, it doesn't necessarily mean that all outdated software contains security vulnerabilities. Yet, it's widely known that one of the reasons software can become insecure over time is due to outdatedness. Therefore, while the statement doesn't explicitly say that the software contains security vulnerabilities, it implies a high likelihood of this being the case.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
