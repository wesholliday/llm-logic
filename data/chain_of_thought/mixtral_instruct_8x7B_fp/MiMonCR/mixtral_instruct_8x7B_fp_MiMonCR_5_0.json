But if we remove the condition that the experiment is successful, then we are left with the statement \"yield groundbreaking results,\" which is what we are trying to infer.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The experiment might yield groundbreaking results\" from the original statement, because the possibility of the experiment yielding groundbreaking results is already implied in the original statement, regardless of whether the experiment is successful or not.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
