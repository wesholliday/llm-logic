            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The project might be delayed and require additional funding\" contains two possible scenarios: the project being delayed and the project requiring additional funding. These are connected by the word \"and\", which means both conditions must be true for the statement to be valid. However, the statement does not explicitly say that the project will only require additional funding if it is delayed. It's possible that the project might need extra funding for reasons unrelated to a delay. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The project might require additional funding\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No."
