Important decisions can certainly be considered sensitive, as they can have significant consequences. Furthermore, the statement \"and involve important decisions\" is explicitly included in the original statement, which strengthens the idea that the meeting might indeed involve important decisions. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is reasonable to infer that the meeting might involve important decisions.\nAnswer: Yes."
