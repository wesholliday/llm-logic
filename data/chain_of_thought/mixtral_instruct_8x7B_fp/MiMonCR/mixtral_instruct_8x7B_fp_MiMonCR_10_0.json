            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The athlete might be injured and unable to compete\" contains two connected ideas: the possibility of the athlete being injured and the consequence of this injury being an inability to compete. The second part of the statement, \"unable to compete,\" is a result of the first part, \"injured.\" Therefore, if the athlete is injured, it necessarily follows that they might be unable to compete. Since the inability to compete is directly linked to the potential injury, we can infer \"The athlete might be unable to compete\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
