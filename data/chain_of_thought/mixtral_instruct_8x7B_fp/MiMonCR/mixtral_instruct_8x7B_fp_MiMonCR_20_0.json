However, the 'and' in this context does not mean that the second condition (the book being adapted into a movie) is dependent on the first condition (the book being a bestseller). It's possible for the book to be adapted into a movie independently of whether or not it becomes a bestseller. Therefore, we can infer that \"The book might be adapted into a movie\" based on the original statement.\nAnswer: Yes"
