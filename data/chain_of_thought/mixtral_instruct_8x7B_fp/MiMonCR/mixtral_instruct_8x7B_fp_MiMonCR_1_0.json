            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The concert might be sold out and feature a famous band\" contains two possible scenarios: 1) the concert is sold out, and 2) the concert features a famous band. Our goal is to determine if the second scenario could be true on its own. If we remove the part about the concert being sold out, the remaining statement \"The concert might feature a famous band\" is still possible. This is because the original statement doesn't imply that a sold-out concert is necessary for a famous band to be featured. Therefore, we can infer that the concert might feature a famous band based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
