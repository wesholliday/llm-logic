We know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. (Let's call this statement A implies B).\n2. We also know that Sue was not at the wedding (not B).\n3. From these two statements, using transitive inference, we can conclude that Mary was not at the wedding (not A). This is because if A implies B, and not B is true, then not A must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
