            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical reasoning question involving transitive inference and contradiction. \n\nFirst, let's consider the first statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This is a conditional statement, also known as a hypothetical or \"if-then\" statement. \n\nNext, we are told that \"Amy did not play tennis.\" This is a direct contradiction to the conclusion of the first statement.\n\nSince the condition for Amy playing tennis (Jeff playing basketball) is not met, we cannot affirm that it is true. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that Jeff played basketball.\n\nHowever, the question asks if we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball. To answer this, we need to consider whether the information provided allows us to definitively conclude that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that Jeff did not play basketball. The given information only allows us to conclude that we cannot infer that Jeff played basketball, but it does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that he did not play basketball."
