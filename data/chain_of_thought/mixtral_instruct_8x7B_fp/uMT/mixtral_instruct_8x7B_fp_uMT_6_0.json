The condition here is \"Sue chose pizza.\" The conclusion is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\nHowever, the second statement tells us that \"Bob did not choose pasta.\" This contradicts the conclusion of the first statement.\n\nIn logic, when we have a conditional statement and its conclusion is found to be false, we cannot definitively say whether the condition is true or false. This is known as the principle of contrapositive.\n\nTherefore, even though it might seem counterintuitive, we cannot infer that Sue did not choose pizza based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No."
