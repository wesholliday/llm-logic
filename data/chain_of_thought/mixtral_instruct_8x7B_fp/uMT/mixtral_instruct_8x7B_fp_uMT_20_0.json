This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part is true (the apple is red), then the second part must also be true (the banana is yellow). \n\nHowever, we are also told that the banana was not yellow. If the banana being yellow is a requirement for the apple being red (as stated in the initial conditional statement), and we know that the banana is not yellow, it follows that the apple cannot be red.\n\nAnswer: No."
