            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical reasoning problem that uses transitive relations. The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement, or if-then statement. The second statement is that \"the truck was not blue.\"\n\nTo determine if the car could not have been red, we need to consider both statements together. If the car being red implies that the truck is blue, then the second statement that the truck was not blue contradicts this. Therefore, the original assumption that the car was red must be false.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
