This type of reasoning is called modus tollens in classical logic.\n\nIn modus tollens, we have a conditional statement (if p, then q) and a negation of the consequent (not q). From this, we can infer the negation of the antecedent (not p).\n\nHere, p represents \"the vampire was awake\" and q represents \"the mummy was awake\". We are given \"not q\" (the mummy was not awake), so by applying modus tollens, we can infer \"not p\" (the vampire was not awake).\n\nAnswer: Yes."
