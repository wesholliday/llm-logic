The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is the form of implication known as a conditional statement. The part before the 'then' is called the antecedent, and the part after the 'then' is called the consequent.\n\nIn this case, the given information also includes \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt,\" which denies the consequent of our original conditional statement. However, denying the consequent does not necessarily mean that the antecedent is also false. It's possible that there's no connection between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt, or that some other factor prevented Mark from buying the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: No."
