            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic logic puzzle that uses the principle of contradiction. According to the first statement, if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. However, the second statement tells us that the pants were not denim, which contradicts the conditional statement. Since the conditional statement cannot be true, the assumption that the shirt was cotton must be false. Therefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
