Chris did not finish the race.\n\nFrom statement 1, if Alex finished the race, then Chris should have finished the race as well. However, statement 2 tells us that Chris did not finish the race. Therefore, based on the information given, Alex could not have finished the race either.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
