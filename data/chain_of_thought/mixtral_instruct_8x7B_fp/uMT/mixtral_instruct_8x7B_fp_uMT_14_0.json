            "content": "Explanation: If the statement \"if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" is a conditional statement (also known as a material implication), it means that the bear being in the cave implies that the wolf is in the den, but the bear being in the cave doesn't have to be the only condition for the wolf to be in the den. \n\nHowever, since we are also given the information that \"the wolf was not in the den,\" we can infer that the condition of the first statement is not met, because if the bear were in the cave, then the wolf would be in the den. But the wolf is not in the den, so the bear cannot be in the cave.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
