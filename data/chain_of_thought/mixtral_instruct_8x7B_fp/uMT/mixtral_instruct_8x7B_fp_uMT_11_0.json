We have two statements here:\n   a) If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n   b) The muffins were not blueberry.\n\n2. From statement (a), we can't directly conclude that the cake is chocolate because it only gives a condition for muffins being blueberry, not a fact.\n\n3. Statement (b) clearly states that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\n4. If statement (a) were true, then the condition for muffins being blueberry would not be met, which contradicts statement (b). Therefore, the cake cannot be chocolate.\n\nAnswer: Yes"
