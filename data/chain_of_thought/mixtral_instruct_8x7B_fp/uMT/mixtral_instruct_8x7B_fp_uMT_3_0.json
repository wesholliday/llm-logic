The second statement contradicts this by saying that the book is not a mystery novel. Taken together, these two statements seem to imply that the book was not written by James, because if it were, it would have to be both a mystery novel (per the first statement) and not a mystery novel (per the second statement). However, this is an incorrect inference based on a logical fallacy. The truth is that we cannot determine whether the book was written by James or not, because the given information is contradictory and does not allow us to draw any firm conclusions.\n\nAnswer: No."
