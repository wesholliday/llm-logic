If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. This is a conditional statement where the condition (alien visiting Mars) leads to a result (robot visiting Jupiter).\n2. The robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that either the original condition (alien visiting Mars) was not met, or it was met but something else happened which prevented the robot from visiting Jupiter despite the alien visiting Mars. However, since the second statement clearly indicates that the robot did not visit Jupiter, the condition of the first statement (alien visiting Mars) cannot be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes, based on the given information, we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars."
