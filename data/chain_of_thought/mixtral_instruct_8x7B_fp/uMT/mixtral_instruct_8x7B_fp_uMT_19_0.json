            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical reasoning question that involves transitive inference. Here's how we can break it down:\n\n1. We know that \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement, often referred to as \"if p, then q.\"\n2. We are also told that \"Jen did not watch basketball.\" This is a negative statement about Jen's actions, or \"not q.\"\n3. To determine whether or not Tom watched football, we need to consider the implications of these two statements together.\n4. If Jen did not watch basketball, then the condition stated in the first sentence cannot be true. In other words, since \"if p, then q\" and \"not q,\" we can infer \"not p.\"\n5. Therefore, if Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
