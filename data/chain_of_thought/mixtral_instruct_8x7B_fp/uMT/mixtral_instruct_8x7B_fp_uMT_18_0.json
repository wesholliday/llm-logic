The truck was not metal.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the truck cannot be metal. \n\nGoing back to the first statement, it tells us that if the doll is plastic, then the truck should be metal. But we just established that the truck is not metal. \n\nTherefore, for the conditional statement \"if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" to hold true, the antecedent (the doll being plastic) cannot be the case here, because we'd end up with a contradiction (the truck being both metal and not metal at the same time).\n\nHence, based on this logical analysis, we can infer that the doll is not plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
