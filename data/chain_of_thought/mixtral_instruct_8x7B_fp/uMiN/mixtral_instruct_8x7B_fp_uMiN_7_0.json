This does not rule out the possibility that Alex could have finished the race, but it also does not guarantee that he did. The negation of the statement \"Alex must have finished the race\" would be \"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race,\" which is equivalent to saying \"It's possible that Alex did not finish the race.\" Since the original statement \"Alex might not have finished the race\" already conveys this possibility, we can infer that it's not the case that Alex must have finished the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes."
