This does not rule out the possibility that the pen could be in the bag. Instead, it suggests that we cannot be certain about the pen's location based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that it is not the case that the pen must be in my bag. It is still possible that the pen is in the bag, we just don't have enough information to confirm it.\n\nAnswer: No."
