However, it does not rule out the possibility that the notebook could still be in the drawer. The statement only acknowledges the possibility of the notebook not being in the drawer, but it does not confirm it. Therefore, we cannot infer that it is not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: No."
