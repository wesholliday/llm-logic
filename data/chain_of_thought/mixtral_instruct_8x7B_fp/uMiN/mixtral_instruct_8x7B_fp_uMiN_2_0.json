However, it does not rule out the possibility that the griffin could have been in the forest. It only expresses uncertainty about the griffin's location.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest. The statement \"The griffin might not have been in the forest\" does not contradict the possibility that the griffin had to be in the forest.\n\nAnswer: No."
