However, it does not rule out the possibility that the toy could be in the toy box. The statement only acknowledges the possibility of the toy not being in the toy box, not the certainty.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that it is not the case that the toy must be in the toy box, because the statement does not provide enough information to make that conclusion. It is still possible that the toy could be in the toy box, even if it is also possible that it is not.\n\nAnswer: No."
