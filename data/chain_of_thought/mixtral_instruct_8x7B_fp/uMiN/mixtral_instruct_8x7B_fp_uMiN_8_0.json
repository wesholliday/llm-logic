It suggests that there is a chance the vampire was not awake, but it does not rule out the possibility that the vampire was awake. The word \"must\" implies certainty, so the statement \"it's not the case that the vampire must have been awake\" means that it's possible the vampire was not awake, but it's also possible that the vampire was awake. Therefore, we cannot infer that it's a certainty that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: No."
