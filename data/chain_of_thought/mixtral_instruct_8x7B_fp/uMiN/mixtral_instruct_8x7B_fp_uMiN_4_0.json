However, it does not rule out the possibility that the alien could have visited some other planet or place instead. The statement \"it's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars\" means that it is not necessary or certain that the alien visited Mars.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the alien's visit to Mars is the only possibility, and we cannot rule out other possibilities.\n\nAnswer: No."
