This does not rule out the possibility that she could have been there, but it does mean that her attendance is not certain.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding, we need to consider whether the given information contradicts the necessity of her presence. In this case, the statement \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" does not contradict the possibility of her absence, so we cannot infer that she must have been there.\n\nAnswer: No."
