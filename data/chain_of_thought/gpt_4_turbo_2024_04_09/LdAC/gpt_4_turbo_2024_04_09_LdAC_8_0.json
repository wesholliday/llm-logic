However, knowing that \\( M \\) is true does not necessarily imply that \\( V \\) is true. The truth of \\( M \\) could be due to \\( V \\) being true, or it could be true independently of the state of \\( V \\).\n\nIn logical terms, \\( V \\implies M \\) does not imply \\( M \\implies V \\). The implication does not work in reverse unless additional information is provided that directly links the truth of \\( M \\) exclusively to \\( V \\).\n\nSince we only know \\( M \\) (the mummy was awake) and have no additional information linking the state of \\( M \\) exclusively to \\( V \\), we cannot logically deduce that \\( V \\) (the vampire was awake) must also be true. \\( M \\) being true does not provide sufficient information to conclude \\( V \\) is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
