However, it does not imply that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary must have been there too. The truth of S (Sue was at the wedding) does not necessarily mean that M (Mary was at the wedding) is true. It is possible that Sue could be at the wedding without Mary being there.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot logically deduce that Mary was at the wedding just because Sue was there.\n\nAnswer: no",
