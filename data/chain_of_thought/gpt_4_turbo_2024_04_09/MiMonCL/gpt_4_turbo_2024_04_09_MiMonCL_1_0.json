            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The flibbit might be zorped and gribbled\" suggests the possibility of two conditions occurring simultaneously: being zorped and being gribbled. When we consider the possibility of both conditions happening together, it inherently includes the possibility of each condition happening individually. Therefore, if it is possible that the flibbit might be both zorped and gribbled, it must also be possible that the flibbit might be zorped, regardless of whether it is gribbled or not. This is because the statement that includes both conditions does not negate the possibility of each condition occurring on its own.\n\nAnswer: yes",
