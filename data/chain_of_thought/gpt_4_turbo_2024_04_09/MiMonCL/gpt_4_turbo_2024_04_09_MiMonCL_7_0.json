            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The investment might be risky and offer high returns\" explicitly mentions that the investment might be risky. This part of the statement is clear and direct. The conjunction \"and\" connects two possibilities about the investment: being risky and offering high returns. Since the statement includes the possibility of the investment being risky as part of its overall description, it directly implies that the investment might indeed be risky. Therefore, from the given statement, we can infer that the investment might be risky.\n\nAnswer: yes",
