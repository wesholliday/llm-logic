            "content": "To solve this, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements provided:\n\n1. \"The sprocket was cranked\" - This is a straightforward statement asserting that an action occurred.\n\n2. \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" - This is a conditional statement. It establishes a condition (the sprocket being cranked) and a consequence (the sprocket being daggled).\n\nGiven these two statements, we can apply the rule of modus ponens, a basic principle in logic. Modus ponens states that if a conditional statement (\"if p then q\") is true, and the antecedent (p) is true, then the consequent (q) must also be true.\n\nHere, the antecedent is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and the consequent is \"the sprocket was daggled\". Since we know both the conditional statement is true and the antecedent is true, we can conclude that the consequent is also true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The sprocket was daggled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
