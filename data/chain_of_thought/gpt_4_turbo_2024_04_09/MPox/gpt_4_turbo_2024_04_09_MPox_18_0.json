We are given the statement \"The shank was plooked.\"\n2. We are also given the conditional statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\"\n3. Applying modus ponens:\n   - P is \"The shank was pooked.\"\n   - Q is \"The shank was nugged.\"\n   - Since P is true (the shank was plooked), and the conditional statement is assumed true, then Q must also be true (the shank was nugged).\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The shank was nugged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
