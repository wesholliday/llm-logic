            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given:\n\n1. \"The dreb was vroombed\" - This is a straightforward statement asserting that an event or condition involving \"the dreb\" being \"vroombed\" has occurred.\n\n2. \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\" - This is a conditional statement. It asserts that if the first condition (the dreb being vroombed) is true, then a second condition (the dreb being spened) must also be true.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can apply the rule of modus ponens, a basic principle in logic. Modus ponens states that if a conditional statement (\"if p then q\") is true, and the antecedent (p) is true, then the consequent (q) must also be true.\n\nApplying this to the statements:\n- \"The dreb was vroombed\" is the antecedent (p).\n- \"The dreb was spened\" is the consequent (q).\n\nSince the antecedent is true (\"The dreb was vroombed\"), and the conditional statement (\"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\") is assumed true, we can conclude that the consequent (\"The dreb was spened\") is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
