The second statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical form as: If P, then Q. Here, P is \"the glip was slogged\" and Q is \"the glip was tragged.\"\n\nGiven that the first statement confirms P is true, and the second statement establishes that if P is true then Q must also be true, we can conclude that Q, \"the glip was tragged,\" must indeed be true based on the rules of logical implication.\n\nAnswer: yes",
