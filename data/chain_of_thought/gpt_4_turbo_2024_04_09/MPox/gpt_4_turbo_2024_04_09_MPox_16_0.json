Additionally, the conditional statement \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" is also provided. According to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if a conditional statement (if p, then q) is true and its antecedent (p) is true, then the consequent (q) must also be true.\n\nHere, \"The sneg was crampled\" represents the antecedent (p), and \"the sneg sproted the frink\" represents the consequent (q). Since both the antecedent is true and the conditional statement is accepted, the consequent \"the sneg sproted the frink\" must also be true based on modus ponens.\n\nAnswer: yes",
