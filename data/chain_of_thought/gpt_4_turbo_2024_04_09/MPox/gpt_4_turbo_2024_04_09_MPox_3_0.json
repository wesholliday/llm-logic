            "content": "To solve this, we can use the logical form of modus ponens, which is a rule of inference in logic. Modus ponens states that if a conditional statement (\"if P then Q\") is true, and the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\n1. We have the conditional statement: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\"\n2. We also know: \"The splat was morphed.\"\n\nApplying modus ponens:\n- P is \"The splat was morphed.\"\n- Q is \"The splat quanked.\"\n- Since P is true (the splat was morphed), and we know \"If P then Q\" is true, then Q must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The splat quanked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
