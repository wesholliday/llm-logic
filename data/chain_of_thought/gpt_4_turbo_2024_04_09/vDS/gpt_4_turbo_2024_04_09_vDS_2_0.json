            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a disjunction: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table.\" This means that at least one of the conditions must be true.\n\n2. The second premise is a negation: \"The book isn't resting on the table.\" This statement denies one of the conditions of the disjunction.\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is: \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nThe structure of the argument is a common form known as disjunctive syllogism. The form of disjunctive syllogism is:\n- Either A or B\n- Not B\n- Therefore, A\n\nIn this case:\n- Either the book is on the shelf (A) or it is resting on the table (B)\n- It is not resting on the table (Not B)\n- Therefore, the book is on the shelf (A)\n\nSince the premises logically lead to the conclusion following the rules of disjunctive syllogism, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
