            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze whether the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises given. The argument can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. Premise 1: Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden.\n2. Premise 2: Fido is not in the garden.\n3. Conclusion: Fido is inside.\n\nThis argument is structured as a disjunctive syllogism. A disjunctive syllogism is a form of logical argument where one is given a disjunction (an \"either/or\" statement) as one premise, and the negation of one of the disjuncts as another premise. The conclusion then affirms the remaining disjunct.\n\nIn this case:\n- The disjunction is \"Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden.\"\n- The negation of one of the disjuncts is \"Fido is not in the garden.\"\n\nGiven these premises, the conclusion that \"Fido is inside\" must be true if the premises are true. This is because, by the structure of disjunctive syllogism, if one disjunct is false (Fido is not in the garden), the other must be true (Fido is inside) to satisfy the initial disjunctive premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
