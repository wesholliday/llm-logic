The use of \"and\" in the statement connects two characteristics of the event: being formal and requiring tickets. Therefore, if we know the event was both formal and required tickets, we can directly infer that the event was formal, as it is explicitly stated as part of the combined characteristics.\n\nAnswer: yes",
