            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been signed and notarized\" implies two conditions that need to be met for the document: it must be signed, and it must be notarized. The conjunction \"and\" in the statement indicates that both conditions are essential and are part of the requirements. Since being notarized typically follows signing (as a document generally needs to be signed before a notary can notarize it), the requirement that the document must be signed is inherently part of the requirement that it must be signed and notarized. Therefore, if it is stated that the document must have been signed and notarized, it directly implies that the document must have been signed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
