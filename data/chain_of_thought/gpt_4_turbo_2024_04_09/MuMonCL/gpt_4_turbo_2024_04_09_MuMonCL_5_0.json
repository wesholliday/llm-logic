            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for\" implies two conditions: 1) the package was delivered today, and 2) the package was signed for upon delivery. The use of \"and\" in the statement connects these two conditions, indicating that both occurred. If we are to infer \"The package must have been delivered today\" from the original statement, we are essentially considering whether the first part of the statement (the package being delivered today) is supported or implied by the full statement. Since the full statement explicitly states that the package was delivered today (as part of the conditions mentioned), it directly supports the inference that the package was indeed delivered today. Therefore, the inference that \"The package must have been delivered today\" from \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for\" is logically valid because the delivery of the package today is a necessary component of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
