            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The exam must have been difficult and covered all chapters\" explicitly includes the information that the exam was difficult. The conjunction \"and\" connects two conditions: the difficulty of the exam and the coverage of all chapters. Since the statement asserts both conditions together, inferring that \"The exam must have been difficult\" is directly supported by the first part of the original statement. Therefore, the inference is valid because it is a direct restatement of part of the original claim.\n\nAnswer: yes",
