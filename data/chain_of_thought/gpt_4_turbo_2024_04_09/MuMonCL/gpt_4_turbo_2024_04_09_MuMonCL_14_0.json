            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The contract must have been valid for a year and renewable\" implies two conditions about the contract: 1) it was valid for a year, and 2) it was renewable after that year. The first part of the statement directly states that the contract's duration was at least one year. Therefore, from this statement, it can be inferred that the contract was indeed valid for a year, as this is explicitly mentioned as part of the conditions described.\n\nAnswer: yes",
