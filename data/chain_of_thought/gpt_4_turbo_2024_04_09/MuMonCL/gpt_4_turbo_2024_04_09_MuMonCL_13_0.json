            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The movie must have been in English and had subtitles\" explicitly includes the information that the movie was in English. The use of \"and\" in the sentence connects two conditions: 1) the movie being in English, and 2) the movie having subtitles. Since the statement asserts both conditions together, the fact that the movie was in English is directly stated. Therefore, it can be inferred from the statement that the movie was indeed in English.\n\nAnswer: yes",
