            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The application must have been completed online and included references\" clearly specifies two requirements for the application: 1) it must have been completed online, and 2) it must have included references. The use of \"and\" in the sentence connects these two distinct conditions, each of which must be met independently. Therefore, if the statement is true, then it necessarily implies that the application was completed online, as this is one of the two explicit conditions mentioned.\n\nAnswer: yes",
