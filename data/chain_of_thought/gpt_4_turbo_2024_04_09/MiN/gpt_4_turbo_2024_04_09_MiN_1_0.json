            "content": "To analyze the inference, let's break down the statements:\n\n1. \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" suggests that there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding. This statement does not confirm whether she was there or not; it only opens up the possibility that she might not have been there.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" implies that it is not necessarily true or required that Mary was at the wedding. This statement negates any obligation or certainty about Mary's presence at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationship between these two statements:\n\n- If it is stated that \"Mary might not have been at the wedding,\" we are acknowledging the uncertainty or possibility of her absence. This inherently means that her presence at the wedding is not certain or mandatory.\n\n- If Mary's presence at the wedding were mandatory or certain (i.e., Mary must have been at the wedding), then saying \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" would be contradictory because it introduces doubt about something that is supposed to be certain.\n\nTherefore, if there is a possibility that Mary might not have been at the wedding, it logically follows that it cannot be definitively required or certain that she was there. Thus, \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" is a valid inference from \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
