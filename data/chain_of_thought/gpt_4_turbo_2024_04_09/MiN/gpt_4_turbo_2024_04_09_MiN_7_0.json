This statement does not confirm whether Alex finished or did not finish; it only opens up the possibility of Alex not finishing.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race\" means that it is not necessarily true that Alex finished the race. This statement negates the certainty or necessity of Alex finishing the race.\n\nFrom the first statement, if there is a possibility that Alex did not finish the race, it implies that finishing the race is not a certainty. Therefore, it cannot be necessarily true or a must that Alex finished the race.\n\nThus, from the statement \"Alex might not have finished the race,\" we can infer that \"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race,\" because the first statement negates the certainty or necessity implied in the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
