            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the relationship between the premise and the conclusion to see if the truth of the premise necessarily guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nPremise: \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\"\nThis premise negates the necessity of Mary's presence at the wedding. It states that it is not necessarily true that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nConclusion: \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\"\nThis conclusion suggests the possibility that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nLogical validity in this context means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true. The premise negates the necessity of Mary's presence, implying that her being at the wedding is not certain or required. This opens up the possibility (but does not confirm) that Mary might not have been at the wedding. Since the premise allows for the possibility that Mary was not at the wedding, and the conclusion states that possibility, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nThus, if it is not necessarily the case that Mary was at the wedding, it is indeed possible that she might not have been there. Therefore, the truth of the premise would guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
