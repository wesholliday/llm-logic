            "content": "To determine whether it necessarily follows that 'Mary was at the wedding' is true, we need to analyze the logical implications of the given statements:\n\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" - This is a conditional statement. It can be represented as: If M, then S.\n\n2. \"Sue was at the wedding\" - This is a simple declarative statement, represented as S.\n\nFrom these statements, we know that Sue being at the wedding (S) is true. However, the conditional statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" only specifies what happens if Mary was at the wedding; it does not necessarily imply that Mary was at the wedding for Sue to be there. \n\nThe conditional statement is true if the premise (Mary was at the wedding) leads to the conclusion (Sue was at the wedding). However, Sue being at the wedding does not depend on Mary being there based on the information given. Sue could be at the wedding regardless of whether Mary was there or not.\n\nTherefore, from the truth of Sue being at the wedding, we cannot conclusively determine that Mary was also at the wedding. The truth of Sue being at the wedding does not logically necessitate that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
