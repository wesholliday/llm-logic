            "content": "To solve this, we need to analyze the logical implications given in the statements:\n\n1. \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" can be represented as: If V (vampire was awake), then M (mummy was awake). In logical terms, this is V \u2192 M.\n\n2. \"The mummy was awake\" is simply M.\n\nWe are asked to determine if it necessarily follows that \"The vampire was awake\" (V) is true.\n\nFrom the logical implication V \u2192 M, we know that if V is true, then M must be true. However, knowing that M is true does not necessarily mean that V must be true. The truth of M (mummy being awake) could be caused by something other than V (vampire being awake). The implication V \u2192 M does not restrict other possible causes for M being true.\n\nTherefore, just because M is true, we cannot conclude that V must also be true. V could be either true or false, and M would still be true as per the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
