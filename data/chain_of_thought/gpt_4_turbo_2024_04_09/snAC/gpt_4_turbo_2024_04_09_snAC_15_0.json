This is because the truth of Q (Erin took a train) could be caused by factors other than P (Sam taking a plane). The conditional statement only specifies what happens if P is true, not that P must be true for Q to be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot conclude that \"Sam took a plane\" must be true just because \"Erin took a train\" is true. This is a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent.\n\nAnswer: no",
