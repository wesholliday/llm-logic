The truth of \\( P \\implies Q \\) only tells us that in every case where \\( P \\) is true, \\( Q \\) must also be true. However, it does not tell us anything about situations where \\( Q \\) is true independently of \\( P \\).\n\nFor example, it could be possible that Erin takes a train for reasons unrelated to whether Sam took a plane. Therefore, knowing that Erin took a train does not necessarily imply that Sam took a plane.\n\nThus, from the statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
