            "content": "To analyze this question, we need to understand the logical relationship between the statements given.\n\nThe statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" can be represented in logical form as:\n\\[ M \\implies S \\]\nwhere \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer from this that \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding,\" which can be represented as:\n\\[ S \\implies M \\]\n\nTo determine if \\( S \\implies M \\) can be inferred from \\( M \\implies S \\), we need to consider the logical relationship. The statement \\( M \\implies S \\) means that whenever Mary is at the wedding, Sue must also be there. However, it does not specify what happens when Sue is at the wedding regarding Mary's presence. Sue being at the wedding could occur with or without Mary being there, based on the information given.\n\nIn logical terms, \\( M \\implies S \\) does not automatically imply \\( S \\implies M \\). The first statement is a one-way implication and does not establish a necessary condition for Sue's presence being dependent on Mary's presence.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
