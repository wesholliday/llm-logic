The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n\n\\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n\nwhere \\( P \\) is \"the shirt was cotton\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer the converse of the original statement, which is \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton.\" This can be written as:\n\n\\( Q \\rightarrow P \\)\n\nIn logic, the truth of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not guarantee the truth of \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\). The truth of the original statement does not imply the truth of its converse unless additional information confirms that the converse also holds true.\n\nTherefore, without additional information, we cannot assume that the converse of the statement is true just because the original statement is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
