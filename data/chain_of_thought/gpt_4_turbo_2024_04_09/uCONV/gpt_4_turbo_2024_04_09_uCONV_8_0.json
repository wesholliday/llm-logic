The original statement only specifies a one-way implication: whenever the vampire is awake, the mummy is also awake. However, it does not specify that the mummy being awake necessarily means the vampire must be awake. There could be situations where the mummy is awake without the vampire being awake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the mummy being awake implies the vampire is awake based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
