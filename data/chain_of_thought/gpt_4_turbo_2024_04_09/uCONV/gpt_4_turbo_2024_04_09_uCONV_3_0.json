The truth of \\( P \\implies Q \\) does not imply the truth of \\( Q \\implies P \\) unless it is specifically stated or proven that \\( P \\) is the only condition for \\( Q \\).\n\nIn practical terms, just because every book James writes is a mystery novel (P implies Q), it does not mean that every mystery novel was written by James (Q implies P). There could be other authors who also write mystery novels.\n\nTherefore, without additional information stating that James is the only author of mystery novels, we cannot infer that all mystery novels are written by James just from knowing that all books written by James are mystery novels.\n\nAnswer: no",
