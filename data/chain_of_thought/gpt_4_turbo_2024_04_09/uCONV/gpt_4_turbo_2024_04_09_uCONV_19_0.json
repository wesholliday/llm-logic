The truth of the original statement (if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball) does not guarantee that the converse (if Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football) is also true. The converse could be true, but it is not necessarily true based solely on the original statement.\n\nTherefore, without additional information, we cannot infer that if Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football just because if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
