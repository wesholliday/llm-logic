The original statement is: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This is a conditional statement where the redness of the apple implies the yellowness of the banana.\n\nHowever, the question asks if the reverse of this statement is true: \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\" This is asking if the converse of the original statement is true.\n\nIn logic, the truth of a conditional statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse. The original statement only specifies what happens when the apple is red; it does not necessarily specify what happens when the banana is yellow. There could be other conditions where the banana is yellow without the apple being red.\n\nTherefore, without additional information, we cannot infer that the converse of the statement is true just because the original statement is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
