Here, A is \"the grommet was sploffed\" and B is \"the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms that A (\"the grommet was sploffed\") is true.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if a conditional statement (If A, then B) is true and its antecedent (A) is true, then the consequent (B) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that \"the grommet plopped the frink\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
