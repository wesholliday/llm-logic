The clug was fleeked.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\nIf P, then Q.\n\nWhere:\nP = The clug was fleeked\nQ = The clug snugged\n\nThe second statement affirms that P (The clug was fleeked) is true.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if 'If P then Q' is true and 'P' is true, then 'Q' must also be true.\n\nApplying this to the given statements:\n- 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged' is true (If P then Q).\n- 'The clug was fleeked' is true (P).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The clug snugged' is true (Q).\n\nAnswer: yes",
