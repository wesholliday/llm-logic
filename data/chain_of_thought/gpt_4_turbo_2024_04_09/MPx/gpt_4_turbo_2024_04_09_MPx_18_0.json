The shank was plooked.\n\nWe are asked to infer whether the shank was nugged.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\nIf P, then Q.\n\nWhere:\nP = The shank was plooked\nQ = The shank was nugged\n\nThe second statement asserts that P is true (The shank was plooked).\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if a conditional statement (If P, then Q) is true and its antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, since both the conditional statement is true and its antecedent is true, we can conclude that the consequent (The shank was nugged) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
