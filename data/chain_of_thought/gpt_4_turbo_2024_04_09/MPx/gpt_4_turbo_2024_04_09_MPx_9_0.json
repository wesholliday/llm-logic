The twonk was plinked.\n\nThe first statement establishes a conditional relationship where the action of the twonk being plinked guarantees that it was also varnished. This is a straightforward implication (if P then Q).\n\nThe second statement confirms that the condition (P) \"The twonk was plinked\" is true.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if we have a conditional statement (if P then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the statements provided, we can logically infer that \"It was varnished.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
