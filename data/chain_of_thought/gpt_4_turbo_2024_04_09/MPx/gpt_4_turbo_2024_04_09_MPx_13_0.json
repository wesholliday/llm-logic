Here, P represents \"the glip was slogged\" and Q represents \"the glip was tragged\".\n\nThe additional information provided is \"The glip was slogged\", which affirms that P is true.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if we have a conditional statement (If P then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\" and the fact that \"The glip was slogged\", we can logically infer that \"The glip was tragged\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
