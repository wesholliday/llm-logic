Here, P represents \"the splat was morphed\" and Q represents \"the splat quanked.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms that P (\"the splat was morphed\") is true.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the statements provided:\n- \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" (If P, then Q)\n- \"The splat was morphed\" (P is true)\n\nWe can logically infer:\n- \"The splat quanked\" (Q is true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
