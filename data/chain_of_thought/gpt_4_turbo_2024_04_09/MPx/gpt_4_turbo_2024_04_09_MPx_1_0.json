The flugel was blimmed.\n\nThis is a classic example of a logical form known as modus ponens, which can be represented as:\n- If P, then Q.\n- P.\n- Therefore, Q.\n\nApplying this to the given statements:\n- P represents \"The flugel was blimmed.\"\n- Q represents \"The flugel was zargled.\"\n\nSince both premises are given as true:\n- \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled\" asserts that if P is true, then Q must also be true.\n- \"The flugel was blimmed\" asserts that P is true.\n\nAccording to modus ponens, if P is true, and if P then Q, then Q must also be true. Therefore, from the premises provided, we can logically infer that \"The flugel was zargled\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
