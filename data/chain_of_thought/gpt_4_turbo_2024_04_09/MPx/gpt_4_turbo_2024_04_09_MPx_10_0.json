The wug was sproinged.\n\nWe are asked to infer whether \"It was garpled\" is a valid conclusion based on these statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\nIf P, then Q.\nWhere P is \"the wug was sproinged\" and Q is \"it was garpled.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms that P (\"the wug was sproinged\") is true.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if \"If P then Q\" is true and P is true, then Q must also be true.\n\nTherefore, since both the conditional statement is true and its antecedent (P) is affirmed, the consequent (Q) \"it was garpled\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
