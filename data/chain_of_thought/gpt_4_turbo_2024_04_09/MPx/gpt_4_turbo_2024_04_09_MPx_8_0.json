The sprocket was cranked.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\nIf P, then Q.\n\nWhere:\nP = The sprocket was cranked\nQ = The sprocket was daggled\n\nThe second statement affirms that P is true (The sprocket was cranked).\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the statements provided:\n- If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled. (If P, then Q)\n- The sprocket was cranked. (P is true)\n\nWe can infer:\n- The sprocket was daggled. (Q is true)\n\nAnswer: yes",
