The fribble was snurgled.\n\nWe need to determine if from these statements, we can infer that 'The fribble crinked'.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\nIf P, then Q.\nWhere P is 'The fribble was snurgled' and Q is 'The fribble crinked'.\n\nThe second statement affirms that P ('The fribble was snurgled') is true.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if 'If P then Q' is true and 'P' is true, then 'Q' must also be true.\n\nTherefore, since both the conditional statement is true and its antecedent (P) is true, the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nThus, we can infer that 'The fribble crinked'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
