Here, P is \"the whiffle was shanked\" and Q is \"the whiffle tinked.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms that P (\"the whiffle was shanked\") is true.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nThus, from the statements provided:\n- \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\" (If P, then Q)\n- \"The whiffle was shanked\" (P is true)\n\nWe can logically infer:\n- \"The whiffle tinked\" (Q is true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
