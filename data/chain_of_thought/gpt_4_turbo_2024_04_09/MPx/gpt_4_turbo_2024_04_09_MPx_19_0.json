The smonk was vreebled.\n\nThis is a classic example of a logical form known as modus ponens, which can be expressed as:\n- If P, then Q.\n- P.\n- Therefore, Q.\n\nIn this case:\n- P is \"the smonk was vreebled.\"\n- Q is \"the smonk plagged.\"\n\nSince the first premise states that if P happens, then Q must follow, and the second premise confirms that P has indeed happened, we can logically conclude that Q must also have occurred.\n\nAnswer: yes",
