            "content": "To determine if we can logically infer that Mary was at the wedding from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements:\n\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If M, then S (where M represents Mary being at the wedding, and S represents Sue being at the wedding).\n\n2. \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a straightforward statement, represented as S.\n\nThe question is whether from these two statements, we can infer that Mary was at the wedding (M).\n\nThe conditional statement \"If M, then S\" tells us that Mary being at the wedding guarantees that Sue was also there. However, it does not state that if Sue is at the wedding, then Mary must also be there. The presence of Sue does not necessarily imply the presence of Mary; it only works one way as specified by the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, knowing that Sue was at the wedding (S is true) does not provide enough information to conclude definitively that Mary was also there. The statement \"If M, then S\" does not imply \"If S, then M\" (which would be the converse of the original statement and is not logically equivalent to the original statement).\n\nThus, from the given information, we cannot logically infer that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
