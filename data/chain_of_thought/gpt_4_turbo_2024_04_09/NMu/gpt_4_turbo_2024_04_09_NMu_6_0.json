            "content": "To analyze the statement and the inference, let's break down the logic:\n\n1. The statement \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" implies that there is no necessity or certainty that Sue chose pizza. This means that while Sue could have chosen pizza, it is not a definite or required choice.\n\n2. The inference \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" suggests the possibility that Sue did not choose pizza. This is a potential scenario given the uncertainty about Sue's choice.\n\n3. Since the original statement negates the certainty of Sue choosing pizza, it opens up the possibility that Sue could have chosen something other than pizza. Therefore, it logically supports the inference that it is possible (\"might\") that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nThus, from the statement that negates the necessity of Sue choosing pizza, we can infer that it is possible she might not have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
