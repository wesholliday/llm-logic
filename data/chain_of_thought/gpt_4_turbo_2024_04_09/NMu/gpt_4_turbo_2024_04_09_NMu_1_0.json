            "content": "To analyze the inference, let's break down the statements:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" - This statement negates the necessity of Mary's presence at the wedding. It implies that there is no obligation or certainty that Mary was at the wedding.\n\n2. \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" - This statement suggests the possibility that Mary was not at the wedding. It does not assert her absence, but rather acknowledges it as one possibility among others.\n\nThe first statement negates the certainty of Mary's presence, thus opening up the possibility that she might not have been there. Since the necessity of her presence is denied, it logically allows for the possibility of her absence. Therefore, from the statement that it is not necessarily the case that Mary was at the wedding, we can infer that it is possible she might not have been there.\n\nAnswer: yes",
