            "content": "To analyze the statement and the inference, let's break down the logic:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer.\"\n   - This statement negates the necessity of the notebook being in the drawer. It means that it is not necessarily true that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\n2. The inference made is: \"The notebook might not be in the drawer.\"\n   - This statement suggests the possibility that the notebook is not in the drawer.\n\n3. To determine if the inference is valid, consider the implications of the original statement:\n   - If it is not necessarily true that the notebook is in the drawer, then there exists at least one possibility where the notebook is not in the drawer.\n\n4. Since the original statement opens up the possibility that the notebook is not in the drawer, the inference that the notebook might not be in the drawer is a valid one.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether we can infer \"The notebook might not be in the drawer\" from \"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer\" is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
