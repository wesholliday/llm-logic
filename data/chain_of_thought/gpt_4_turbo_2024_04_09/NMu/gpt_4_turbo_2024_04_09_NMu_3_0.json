The original statement is: \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James.\"\n2. This statement negates the necessity that James wrote the book. In other words, it is not necessarily true that James is the author.\n3. The statement does not assert that James definitely did not write the book; rather, it denies the certainty or requirement of James being the author.\n4. The inference in question is: \"The book might not have been written by James.\"\n5. This inference suggests the possibility that James is not the author, which is a valid consideration given that the original statement has already negated the necessity of James being the author.\n\nSince the original statement removes the certainty of James as the author, it logically allows for the possibility that James might not be the author. Therefore, the inference that \"The book might not have been written by James\" is a reasonable conclusion based on the information given in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
