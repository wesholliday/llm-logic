The original statement is: \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\" In logical terms, this can be written as: If P, then Q.\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink.\" In logical terms, this is: If not P, then not Q.\n\n3. The inference from \"If P, then Q\" to \"If not P, then not Q\" is a logical fallacy known as denying the antecedent. This fallacy occurs because the original statement (If P, then Q) does not specify what happens when P is false. Q could still be true even if P is false.\n\n4. Therefore, from the statement \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
