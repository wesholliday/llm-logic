Given statement: \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical form as: If S (slogged), then T (tragged). Symbolically, S \u2192 T.\n\n2. Statement to infer: \"If the glip was not slogged, then the glip was not tragged.\"\n   - This can be represented as: If not S (not slogged), then not T (not tragged). Symbolically, \u00acS \u2192 \u00acT.\n\nThe statement to infer (\u00acS \u2192 \u00acT) is known as the contrapositive of the original statement (S \u2192 T). In logic, a statement and its contrapositive always have the same truth value. If the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statement \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged,\" we can indeed infer that \"If the glip was not slogged, then the glip was not tragged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
