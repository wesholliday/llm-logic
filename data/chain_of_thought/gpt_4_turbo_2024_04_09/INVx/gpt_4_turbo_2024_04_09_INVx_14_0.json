In logic, the truth of the original conditional statement (If P, then Q) does not necessarily imply the truth of its inverse (If not P, then not Q). The truth of \"If P, then Q\" only establishes that whenever P happens, Q must happen. It does not say anything about the situation where P does not happen; Q could either happen or not happen in that case.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
