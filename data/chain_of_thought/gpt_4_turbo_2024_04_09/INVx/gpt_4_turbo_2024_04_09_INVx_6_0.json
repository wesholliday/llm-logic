            "content": "To determine if the inference is valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement is a conditional: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n\\[ P \\implies Q \\]\nwhere \\( P \\) is \"the grommet was sploffed\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer: \"If the grommet was not sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink.\" This can be written as:\n\\[ \\neg P \\implies \\neg Q \\]\n\nThis is known as the inverse of the original statement. However, the truth of the inverse is not necessarily guaranteed by the truth of the original statement. The inverse (\\( \\neg P \\implies \\neg Q \\)) is not logically equivalent to the original statement (\\( P \\implies Q \\)). The truth of \\( P \\implies Q \\) does not imply the truth of \\( \\neg P \\implies \\neg Q \\).\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If the grommet was not sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
