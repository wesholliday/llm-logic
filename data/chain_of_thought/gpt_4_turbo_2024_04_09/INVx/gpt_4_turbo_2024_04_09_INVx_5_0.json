            "content": "To solve this, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\" This can be represented in logical form as: \n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"the zinger was fraggled\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the zinger was smoogled\".\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. The inference from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) to \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is a form of logical implication known as the converse of the contrapositive. The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), which is logically equivalent to \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). However, \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is not equivalent to \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\); it is actually the converse of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\n4. To see why \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) (If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled) is not necessarily true given \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled), consider a situation where being fraggled is one way to be smoogled, but not the only way. For example, there could be other conditions (say, being \"zoggled\") that could also result in the zinger being smoogled. In such a case, the zinger not being fraggled (\\( \\neg P \\)) does not necessarily mean the zinger cannot be smoogled (\\( \\neg Q \\)).\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled,\" we cannot infer that \"If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
