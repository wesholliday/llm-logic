            "content": "To analyze the given statement and its inference, we need to understand the logical structure of the statement and apply the rules of logic to it.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\" This can be represented in logical form as:\n\\[ P \\implies Q \\]\nwhere \\( P \\) is \"the sneg was crampled\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the sneg sproted the frink.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer: \"If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink.\" This can be represented as:\n\\[ \\neg P \\implies \\neg Q \\]\n\nThe inference from \\( P \\implies Q \\) to \\( \\neg P \\implies \\neg Q \\) is a logical fallacy known as denying the antecedent. This fallacy occurs because the truth of \\( P \\implies Q \\) does not determine the truth of situations where \\( P \\) is false. In other words, just because the sneg sproting the frink follows from the sneg being crampled, it does not necessarily mean that if the sneg is not crampled, it cannot sprot the frink. There could be other reasons or conditions under which the sneg might sprot the frink, unrelated to whether it was crampled.\n\nTherefore, based on the rules of logic, we cannot infer \\( \\neg P \\implies \\neg Q \\) from \\( P \\implies Q \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
