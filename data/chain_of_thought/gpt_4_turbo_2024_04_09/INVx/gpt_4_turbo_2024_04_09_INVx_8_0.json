The inverse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not P, then not Q\". The converse of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If Q, then P\". Therefore, the statement \"If not P, then not Q\" is not directly inferable from \"If P, then Q\" without additional information about the exclusivity or necessity of the conditions.\n\nIn logical terms, just because \"If P, then Q\" is true, it does not necessarily mean that \"If not P, then not Q\" is true. The original statement does not specify that P is the only condition for Q or that Q cannot occur without P. There could be other conditions that could also lead to Q being true, even when P is false.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled\" without additional information.\n\nAnswer: no",
