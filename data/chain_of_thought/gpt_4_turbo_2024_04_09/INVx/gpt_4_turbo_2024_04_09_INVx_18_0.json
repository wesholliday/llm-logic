            "content": "To analyze the inference, let's break down the given statement and the statement we need to infer:\n\n1. Given statement: \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement of the form: If P, then Q.\n\n2. Statement to infer: \"If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged.\"\n   - This is another conditional statement of the form: If not P, then not Q.\n\nThe statement to infer is known as the inverse of the original statement. In logic, the truth of a conditional statement (If P, then Q) does not necessarily imply the truth of its inverse (If not P, then not Q). The truth of \"If P, then Q\" only establishes that in every case where P is true, Q must also be true. It does not say anything about the cases where P is false.\n\nFor example, consider the statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" This statement is true. However, the inverse, \"If it is not raining, then the ground is not wet,\" is not necessarily true because there could be other reasons for the ground being wet, such as a sprinkler system.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
