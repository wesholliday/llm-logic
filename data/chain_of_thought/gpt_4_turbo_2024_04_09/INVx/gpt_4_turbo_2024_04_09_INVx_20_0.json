This fallacy occurs because the truth of \\( P \\implies Q \\) does not determine the truth of situations where \\( P \\) is false. In other words, just because \"if P then Q\" is true, it does not necessarily mean that \"if not P then not Q\" is true. There could be other reasons or conditions under which \\( Q \\) could still be true even if \\( P \\) is false.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If the fleeg was not bluttered, then it did not surn.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
