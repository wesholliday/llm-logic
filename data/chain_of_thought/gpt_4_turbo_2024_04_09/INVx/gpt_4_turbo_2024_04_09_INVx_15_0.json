In logic, the truth of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" does not necessarily imply the truth of \"If not P, then not Q.\" The truth of the original statement does not depend on what happens when P is false. The original statement only specifies what happens when P is true.\n\nTherefore, from the truth of \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened,\" we cannot logically infer \"If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened\" without additional information.\n\nAnswer: no",
