            "content": "To analyze the inference, let's break down the given statement and the statement we need to infer:\n\n1. Given statement: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement of the form: If P, then Q.\n\n2. Statement to infer: \"If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank.\"\n   - This is another conditional statement of the form: If not P, then not Q.\n\nThe statement to infer is known as the inverse of the original statement. In logic, the truth of a conditional statement (If P, then Q) does not necessarily imply the truth of its inverse (If not P, then not Q). The truth of the original statement does not depend on what happens when P is false. It only specifies what happens when P is true.\n\nTherefore, from the truth of \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked,\" we cannot logically infer \"If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank\" without additional information about the relationship between being morphed and quanking when not morphed.\n\nAnswer: no",
