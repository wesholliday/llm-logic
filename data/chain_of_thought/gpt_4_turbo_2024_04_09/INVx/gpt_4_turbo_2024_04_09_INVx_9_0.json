The original statement is: \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical form as: If P, then Q.\n\n2. The statement we are asked to infer is: \"If the twonk was not plinked, then it was not varnished.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical form as: If not P, then not Q.\n\nThe original statement (If P, then Q) asserts that every time P happens, Q also happens. However, it does not specify what happens when P does not happen. There could be cases where P does not happen, but Q still happens. Therefore, the absence of P (not P) does not necessarily imply the absence of Q (not Q).\n\nThe inference we are asked to make is a form of the logical fallacy known as \"denying the antecedent.\" This fallacy occurs when one concludes that not Q must be true just because not P is true, which is not supported by the original conditional statement.\n\nThus, from the statement \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If the twonk was not plinked, then it was not varnished.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
