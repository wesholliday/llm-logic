The truth of \"If P, then Q\" does not imply \"If not P, then not Q.\" For example, just because \"If it rains, the ground is wet\" is true, it does not mean \"If it does not rain, the ground is not wet\" is true, as there could be other reasons for the ground being wet (like a sprinkler).\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
