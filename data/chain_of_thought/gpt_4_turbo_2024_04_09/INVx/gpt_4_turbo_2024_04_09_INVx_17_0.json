This fallacy occurs because the truth of the original conditional statement (If P, then Q) does not determine what happens when P is false. The original statement only specifies what happens when P is true.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If the flob was not skizzled, then the flob was not movated.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
