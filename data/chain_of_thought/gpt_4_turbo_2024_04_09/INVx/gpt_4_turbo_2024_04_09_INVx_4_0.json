Given statement: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P then Q\", where P is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and Q is \"the fribble crinked\".\n\n2. Proposed inference: \"If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink.\"\n   - This is another conditional statement of the form \"If not P then not Q\".\n\nThe inference we are asked to evaluate is whether the truth of the first statement guarantees the truth of the second statement. This involves understanding the logical relationship between the two.\n\nThe first statement being true means that every time the fribble is snurgled, it definitely crinks. However, it does not provide information about what happens when the fribble is not snurgled. The fribble might still crink or might not crink when it is not snurgled. The original statement does not restrict the possibility of the fribble crinking in other circumstances.\n\nThe proposed inference is a form of the logical fallacy known as \"denying the antecedent\". This fallacy occurs when it is concluded that if the antecedent (P) is false, then the consequent (Q) must also be false. However, the truth of the consequent is not necessarily dependent solely on the antecedent in conditional logic.\n\nTherefore, from the truth of \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
