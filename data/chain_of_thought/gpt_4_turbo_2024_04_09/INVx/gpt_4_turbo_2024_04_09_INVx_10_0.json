Given statement: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement of the form: If P, then Q.\n   - Here, P is \"the wug was sproinged\" and Q is \"it was garpled.\"\n\n2. Proposed inference: \"If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled.\"\n   - This is another conditional statement of the form: If not P, then not Q.\n\nThe proposed inference is attempting to establish a logical relationship known as the contrapositive. However, the correct form of the contrapositive of the original statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" This means that if the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged.\n\nThe statement \"If not P, then not Q\" is actually the inverse of the original statement, and it does not logically follow from the original statement. Just because \"If P, then Q\" is true, it does not necessarily mean that \"If not P, then not Q\" is true. The truth of P implies the truth of Q, but the falsity of P does not necessarily imply the falsity of Q.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
