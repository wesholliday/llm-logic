However, this is not a valid inference in formal logic. Just because the original condition (P) being true guarantees the consequence (Q), it does not mean that the absence of the condition (not P) guarantees the absence of the consequence (not Q). There could be other reasons or conditions under which Q could still be true, even if P is not.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint,\" we cannot validly infer that \"If the wug was not flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
