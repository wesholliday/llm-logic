            "content": "Explanation: To address the inference from \"The document must have been notarized\" to \"The document must have been signed and notarized,\" it's important to understand the process of notarization. Notarization typically involves a notary public who witnesses the signing of a document and verifies the identity of the signers. The key function of a notary is to ensure that the signatures on the document are legitimate and that the signers are willingly signing the document in their presence.\n\nGiven this understanding, for a document to be notarized, it must first be signed in the presence of the notary. Therefore, if a document has been notarized, it implies that the document was indeed signed before or during the notarization process. Thus, the statement \"The document must have been notarized\" inherently includes the fact that the document was signed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
