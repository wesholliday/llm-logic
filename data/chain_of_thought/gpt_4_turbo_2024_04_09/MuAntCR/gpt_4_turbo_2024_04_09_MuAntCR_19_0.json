However, it does not provide any information about the method through which the application was completed, such as whether it was done online or through some other means. To infer that \"The application must have been completed online and included references\" from the original statement, there would need to be additional information linking the requirement of including references specifically to completing the application online. Since no such information is provided in the original statement, we cannot make this inference solely based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
