It does not provide any information about the time of the meeting. To infer that \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM and in the conference room\" from the original statement, we would need additional information indicating that the meeting was specifically at 2 PM. Since no such information about the time is provided in the original statement, we cannot logically infer the added detail about the time of the meeting based solely on the information given about the location.\n\nAnswer: no",
