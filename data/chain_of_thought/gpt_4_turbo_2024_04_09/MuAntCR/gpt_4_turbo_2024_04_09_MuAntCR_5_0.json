            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package must have been signed for\" indicates that the package was definitely signed for at some point. However, this statement does not specify when the package was delivered or signed for. The additional information in the second statement, \"The package must have been delivered yesterday and signed for,\" introduces a specific time frame (yesterday) that was not mentioned in the original statement. Without additional context or information linking the signing of the package specifically to yesterday, we cannot logically infer that the package was both delivered and signed for on that specific day based solely on the information that it was signed for at some unspecified time.\n\nAnswer: no",
