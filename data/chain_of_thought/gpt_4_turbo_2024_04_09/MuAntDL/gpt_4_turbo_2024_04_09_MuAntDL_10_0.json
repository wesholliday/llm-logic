            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been signed or notarized\" implies that there are two acceptable conditions for the document: it could either be signed or it could be notarized. This statement does not necessarily mean that signing is a requirement, as the condition could also be satisfied if the document is merely notarized. Therefore, from the given statement, we cannot definitively infer that the document must have been signed, because the notarization alone would fulfill the requirement.\n\nAnswer: no",
