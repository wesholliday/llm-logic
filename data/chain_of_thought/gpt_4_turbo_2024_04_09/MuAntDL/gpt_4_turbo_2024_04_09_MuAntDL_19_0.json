            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The application must have been completed online or in person\" presents two possibilities for completing the application: online or in person. This statement is inclusive, meaning that either method is acceptable. To infer that \"The application must have been completed online\" from the original statement would mean excluding the possibility of completing it in person, which the original statement does not support. The use of \"or\" in the original statement indicates an option between two methods, not a requirement for one specific method. Therefore, inferring that the application must have been completed online exclusively would be incorrect based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
