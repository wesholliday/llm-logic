            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The event must have been formal or semi-formal\" suggests that the event could have been either formal or semi-formal. This statement includes two possibilities for the nature of the event's dress code. Inferring that \"The event must have been formal\" from this statement would exclude the possibility that the event could have been semi-formal, which is clearly included as an option in the original statement. Therefore, the inference that the event must have been strictly formal is not supported by the statement that it could have been either formal or semi-formal.\n\nAnswer: no",
