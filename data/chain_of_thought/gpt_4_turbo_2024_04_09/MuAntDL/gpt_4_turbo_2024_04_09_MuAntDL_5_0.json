            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package must have been delivered yesterday or the day before\" suggests two possible days for the delivery of the package: yesterday or the day before yesterday. This statement does not exclusively confirm the delivery on either day but rather opens up the possibility for either day. To infer that \"The package must have been delivered yesterday\" from the original statement would require excluding the possibility of the package being delivered the day before yesterday, which the original statement does not do. Therefore, the inference that the package must have been delivered specifically yesterday cannot be made solely based on the given statement, as it allows for another possibility.\n\nAnswer: no",
