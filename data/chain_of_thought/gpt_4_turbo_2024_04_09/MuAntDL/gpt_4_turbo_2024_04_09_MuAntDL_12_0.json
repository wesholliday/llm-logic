            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday or extended\" presents two possibilities: either the project was completed by Friday, or it was extended beyond Friday. This statement does not definitively confirm that the project was completed by Friday; it only presents it as one of the possible outcomes. The use of \"or\" in the statement indicates a choice between two alternatives, not a certainty that the first condition (completion by Friday) was met. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot infer that the project was definitely completed by Friday without considering the possibility of the project being extended.\n\nAnswer: no",
