We also know \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be written in logical form as:\n   If P (Sam took a plane), then Q (Erin took a train).\n\nGiven that Q is true (Erin did take a train), we need to determine if this necessarily means that P (Sam took a plane) is also true.\n\nIn logic, knowing that the consequent (Q) is true does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (P) must be true. This is because the truth of the consequent (Erin took a train) could be caused by something other than the antecedent (Sam taking a plane). There could be other reasons why Erin took a train, unrelated to whether Sam took a plane or not.\n\nTherefore, from the truth of \"Erin took a train,\" we cannot definitively conclude that \"Sam took a plane.\" The conditional statement only specifies what happens if Sam took a plane, not that Sam must have taken a plane for Erin to take a train.\n\nAnswer: no",
