We also know \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\nwhere \\( P \\) is \"Sue chose pizza\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\nGiven that \\( Q \\) (Bob chose pasta) is true, we need to determine if this necessarily means that \\( P \\) (Sue chose pizza) must also be true.\n\nIn logic, knowing that the consequent (\\( Q \\)) is true does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (\\( P \\)) is true. This is because the truth of the consequent does not depend solely on the antecedent in a conditional statement. The conditional statement is only false if \\( P \\) is true and \\( Q \\) is false. If \\( Q \\) is true, \\( P \\) can either be true or false without affecting the truth of the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, from the fact that \"Bob chose pasta,\" we cannot definitively conclude that \"Sue chose pizza,\" because \"Bob chose pasta\" could be true regardless of Sue's choice.\n\nAnswer: no",
