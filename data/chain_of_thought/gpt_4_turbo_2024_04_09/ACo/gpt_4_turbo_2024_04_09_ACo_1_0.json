            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"Mary was at the wedding\" from the given statements, let's analyze the logic:\n\n1. We know \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n2. We also know \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be written in logical form as:\n   If P (Mary was at the wedding), then Q (Sue was at the wedding).\n\nFrom the first statement, we know Q is true (Sue was at the wedding). However, knowing Q is true does not necessarily imply that P is true in a conditional statement. The truth of Q (Sue was at the wedding) does not depend on P (Mary was at the wedding) being true; it only means that if P were true, Q would definitely be true.\n\nIn logical terms, knowing Q does not allow us to infer P. The conditional statement \"If P then Q\" does not imply \"If Q then P\" (which is a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent).\n\nTherefore, from the information given, we cannot infer that Mary was at the wedding just because Sue was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
