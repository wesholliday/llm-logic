However, knowing M is true does not necessarily imply that V must be true because the truth of M could be independent of the truth of V. In logical terms, the truth of the consequent (M) does not dictate the truth of the antecedent (V).\n\nTherefore, from the statements provided, we cannot definitively conclude that the vampire was awake just because the mummy was awake. The vampire being awake is one possible reason for the mummy's wakefulness, but it is not the only possible explanation.\n\nAnswer: no",
