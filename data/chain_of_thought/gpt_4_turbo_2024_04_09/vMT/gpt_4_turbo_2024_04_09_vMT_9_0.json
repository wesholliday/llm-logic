            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( L \\rightarrow M \\), where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( M \\) represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" Symbolically, this is \\( \\neg M \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is: \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" Symbolically, this is \\( \\neg L \\).\n\nTo check the validity of the argument, we need to see if the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. This involves checking if the logical structure \\( (L \\rightarrow M) \\land (\\neg M) \\rightarrow (\\neg L) \\) holds.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, particularly modus tollens, we can analyze this structure:\n- Modus tollens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) are both true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n- Applying modus tollens to our symbolic representation:\n  - \\( P \\) corresponds to \\( L \\) (Lisa bought the red shirt),\n  - \\( Q \\) corresponds to \\( M \\) (Mark bought the blue shirt),\n  - \\( \\neg Q \\) corresponds to \\( \\neg M \\) (Mark did not buy the blue shirt).\n\nSince \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\) are given as true, modus tollens allows us to conclude \\( \\neg L \\) (Lisa did not buy the red shirt).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises according to the rules of logic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
