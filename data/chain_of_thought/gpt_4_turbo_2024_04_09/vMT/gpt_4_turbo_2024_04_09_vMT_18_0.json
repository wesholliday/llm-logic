            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" In logical form, this can be written as: P \u2192 Q, where P represents \"the doll was plastic\" and Q represents \"the truck was metal.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \"The truck was not metal.\" This can be written as: \u00acQ.\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is: \"The doll was not plastic.\" This can be written as: \u00acP.\n\nThe argument structure here is a form of logical reasoning called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid argument form that works as follows:\n- If P implies Q (P \u2192 Q),\n- and not Q (\u00acQ),\n- then not P (\u00acP).\n\nGiven that the premises are:\n- If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal (P \u2192 Q),\n- The truck was not metal (\u00acQ),\n\nThe valid conclusion according to modus tollens would be:\n- The doll was not plastic (\u00acP).\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of modus tollens, it is a logically valid argument.\n\nAnswer: yes",
