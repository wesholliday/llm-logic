            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This can be symbolically represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \"Bob did not choose pasta.\" Symbolically, this is \u00acQ.\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is: \"Sue did not choose pizza.\" Symbolically, this is \u00acP.\n\nThe argument structure here is modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens states that if P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP. Applying this to the given premises:\n- If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. (P \u2192 Q)\n- Bob did not choose pasta. (\u00acQ)\n- Therefore, Sue did not choose pizza. (\u00acP)\n\nSince the premises logically lead to the conclusion following the modus tollens structure, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
