            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" In logical form, this can be written as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) where \\( P \\) is \"the dog was inside\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the cat was outside.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \"The cat was not outside.\" This can be written as \\( \\neg Q \\) where \\( \\neg \\) denotes negation.\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is: \"The dog was not inside.\" This can be written as \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nThe argument structure here is a form of modus tollens, a valid argument form in classical logic. Modus tollens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) are both true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true. \n\nGiven the premises:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside)\n   - \\( \\neg Q \\) (The cat was not outside)\n\nWe can validly conclude:\n   - \\( \\neg P \\) (The dog was not inside)\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens structure, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
