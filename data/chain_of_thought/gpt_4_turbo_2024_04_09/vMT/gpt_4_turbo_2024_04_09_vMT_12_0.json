            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow L \\), where \\( P \\) represents \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( L \\) represents \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" Symbolically, this is \\( \\neg L \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is \"Joe did not go to the park,\" which can be represented as \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nTo check the validity of the argument, we need to see if the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. This involves checking if the logical structure holds under all circumstances.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, particularly modus tollens, we can analyze the argument:\n- Modus tollens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow L \\) and \\( \\neg L \\) are both true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n- Applying modus tollens here: since \\( P \\rightarrow L \\) (if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo) and \\( \\neg L \\) (Lucy did not go to the zoo) are given as true, it logically follows that \\( \\neg P \\) (Joe did not go to the park) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises using the rule of modus tollens.\n\nAnswer: yes",
