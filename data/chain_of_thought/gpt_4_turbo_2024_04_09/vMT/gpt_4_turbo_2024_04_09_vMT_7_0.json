            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( A \\rightarrow C \\), where \\( A \\) is \"Alex finished the race\" and \\( C \\) is \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \"Chris did not finish the race.\" Symbolically, this is \\( \\neg C \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is: \"Alex did not finish the race,\" which can be represented as \\( \\neg A \\).\n\nTo check the validity of the argument, we need to see if the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. We can use the rules of logic to analyze this:\n\n- From the first premise \\( A \\rightarrow C \\), we know that if \\( A \\) is true, then \\( C \\) must be true.\n- From the second premise \\( \\neg C \\), we know that \\( C \\) is false.\n\nGiven that \\( C \\) is false, and \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) (meaning \\( A \\) being true would imply \\( C \\) is true), the only way both premises can be true is if \\( A \\) is false. If \\( A \\) were true, it would contradict the truth of \\( \\neg C \\) because \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) would require \\( C \\) to be true.\n\nThus, the premises \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) and \\( \\neg C \\) together logically lead to the conclusion \\( \\neg A \\). Therefore, the argument is valid because the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
