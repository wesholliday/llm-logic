            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" In logical form, this can be written as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) where \\( P \\) is \"the apple was red\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \"The banana was not yellow.\" This can be written as: \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is: \"The apple was not red.\" This can be written as: \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nThe argument structure here is attempting to use a form of logical reasoning called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that takes the following form:\n   - If \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - \\( \\neg Q \\)\n   - Therefore, \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nGiven that the premises are:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow)\n   - \\( \\neg Q \\) (The banana was not yellow)\n\nThe valid conclusion according to modus tollens would be:\n   - \\( \\neg P \\) (The apple was not red)\n\nSince the argument follows this structure, it is a logically valid argument.\n\nAnswer: yes",
