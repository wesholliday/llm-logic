            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" In logical form, this can be written as: \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) (where \\( V \\) represents \"the vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the mummy was awake\").\n\n2. The second premise states: \"The mummy was not awake.\" In logical form, this is written as: \\( \\neg M \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is: \"The vampire was not awake.\" In logical form, this is \\( \\neg V \\).\n\nTo test the validity of the argument, we need to see if it is possible for both premises to be true and the conclusion to be false. If such a scenario exists, the argument is invalid.\n\n- From the first premise \\( V \\rightarrow M \\), we know that if \\( V \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must be true.\n- From the second premise \\( \\neg M \\), we know that \\( M \\) is false.\n\nGiven \\( \\neg M \\) (the mummy was not awake), if \\( V \\) (the vampire was awake) were true, it would contradict the first premise because \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) asserts that if \\( V \\) is true, \\( M \\) must also be true. Therefore, \\( V \\) must be false to maintain the truth of the first premise under the condition that \\( M \\) is false.\n\nSince \\( \\neg V \\) (the vampire was not awake) follows necessarily from \\( \\neg M \\) and \\( V \\rightarrow M \\), the conclusion \\( \\neg V \\) is supported by the premises. Thus, there is no scenario where both premises are true and the conclusion is false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
