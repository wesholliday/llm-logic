            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" In logical form, this can be written as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) represents \"the car was red\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"the truck was blue.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \"The truck was not blue.\" This can be written as \\( \\neg Q \\) (not \\( Q \\)).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is: \"The car was not red.\" This can be written as \\( \\neg P \\) (not \\( P \\)).\n\nThe argument structure here is known as modus tollens, which is a valid argument form. Modus tollens works as follows:\n- If \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If P then Q)\n- \\( \\neg Q \\) (Not Q)\n- Therefore, \\( \\neg P \\) (Therefore, not P)\n\nSince the premises given fit this structure (with \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\)), and the conclusion is \\( \\neg P \\), the argument is valid. The conclusion \\( \\neg P \\) logically follows from the premises \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
