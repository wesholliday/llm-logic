            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the griffin was in the forest\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \"The unicorn was not in the forest.\" Symbolically, this is \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is: \"The griffin was not in the forest.\" Symbolically, this is \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nThe argument structure here is attempting to use a form of logical reasoning called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that goes as follows: If \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), then \\( \\neg P \\). This matches the structure of the given argument.\n\n- Given \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest)\n- And \\( \\neg Q \\) (The unicorn was not in the forest)\n- Therefore, \\( \\neg P \\) (The griffin was not in the forest)\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens structure, it is a logically valid argument. The conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
