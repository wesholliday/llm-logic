            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This can be symbolically represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q is \"Kate ate salad.\"\n\n2. The second premise is a negation: \"Kate did not eat salad.\" Symbolically, this is \u00acQ.\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is \"Ben did not eat pasta,\" which can be represented as \u00acP.\n\nThe argument structure here is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus tollens states that if P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then you can conclude \u00acP. \n\n- Applying this to the given argument:\n  - If \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" (P \u2192 Q)\n  - and \"Kate did not eat salad\" (\u00acQ),\n  - then it logically follows that \"Ben did not eat pasta\" (\u00acP).\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens structure, it is a logically valid argument.\n\nAnswer: yes",
