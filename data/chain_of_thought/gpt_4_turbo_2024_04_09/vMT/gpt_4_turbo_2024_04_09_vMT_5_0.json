            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \"Amy did not play tennis.\" Symbolically, this is \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is: \"Jeff did not play basketball.\" Symbolically, this is \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nThe argument structure here is known as modus tollens, a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus tollens works as follows:\n- If \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis)\n- And \\( \\neg Q \\) (Amy did not play tennis)\n- Then \\( \\neg P \\) (Therefore, Jeff did not play basketball)\n\nSince the premises logically lead to the conclusion following the modus tollens structure, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
