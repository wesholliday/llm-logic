            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" In logical form, this can be written as: P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin took a train.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \"Erin did not take a train.\" This can be written as: \u00acQ.\n\n3. The conclusion drawn from these premises is: \"Sam did not take a plane.\" This can be written as: \u00acP.\n\nThe argument structure here is known as modus tollens, a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus tollens works as follows:\n- If P implies Q (P \u2192 Q),\n- and not Q (\u00acQ),\n- then not P (\u00acP).\n\nGiven that the premises are:\n- If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train (P \u2192 Q),\n- Erin did not take a train (\u00acQ),\n\nThe valid conclusion according to modus tollens is:\n- Sam did not take a plane (\u00acP).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
