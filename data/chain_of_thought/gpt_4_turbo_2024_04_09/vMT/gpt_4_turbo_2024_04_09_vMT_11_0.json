            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the cake was chocolate\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \"The muffins were not blueberry.\" Symbolically, this is \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is: \"The cake was not chocolate.\" Symbolically, this is \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nThe argument structure here is known as modus tollens, a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus tollens works as follows:\n- If \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If P then Q)\n- \\( \\neg Q \\) (Not Q)\n- Therefore, \\( \\neg P \\) (Therefore, not P)\n\nGiven that the premises are:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (\"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\")\n- \\( \\neg Q \\) (\"The muffins were not blueberry\")\n\nThe valid conclusion according to modus tollens would be:\n- \\( \\neg P \\) (\"The cake was not chocolate\")\n\nSince the argument follows this structure, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
