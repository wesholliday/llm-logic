            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where:\n   - \\( P \\) = The book was written by James\n   - \\( Q \\) = The book is a mystery novel\n\n2. The second premise states: \"The book is not a mystery novel.\" This is the negation of \\( Q \\), which can be symbolically represented as \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is: \"The book was not written by James.\" This is the negation of \\( P \\), symbolically \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nTo check the validity of the argument, we need to see if \\( \\neg Q \\) (the book is not a mystery novel) necessarily leads to \\( \\neg P \\) (the book was not written by James) given the conditional \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel).\n\nUsing the rules of logic, particularly modus tollens, we can infer \\( \\neg P \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\). Modus tollens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) are true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true. Here's the breakdown:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\): If the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel.\n- \\( \\neg Q \\): The book is not a mystery novel.\n- Therefore, \\( \\neg P \\): The book was not written by James.\n\nSince the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\) follows logically from the premises \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) through modus tollens, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
