            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" In logical form, this can be written as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"the pants were denim.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \"The pants were not denim.\" This is the negation of \\( Q \\), written as \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is: \"The shirt was not cotton.\" This is the negation of \\( P \\), written as \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nThe argument structure here is:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- \\( \\neg Q \\)\n- Therefore, \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nThis is a form of logical reasoning known as modus tollens, which is a valid argument form. Modus tollens states that if a conditional statement (\\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)) is true, and the consequent (\\( Q \\)) is false, then the antecedent (\\( P \\)) must also be false. Therefore, if the premises are true, the conclusion must necessarily be true.\n\nThus, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
