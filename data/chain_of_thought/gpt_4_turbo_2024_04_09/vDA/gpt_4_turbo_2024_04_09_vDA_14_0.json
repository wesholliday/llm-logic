            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the bear was in the cave\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \"The bear was not in the cave.\" Symbolically, this is \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is: \"The wolf was not in the den,\" which can be represented as \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nTo evaluate the validity of the argument, we need to check if the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. In logical terms, we are checking if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\) necessarily lead to \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nFrom the truth table of a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\):\n- If \\( P \\) is true and \\( Q \\) is true, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true.\n- If \\( P \\) is true and \\( Q \\) is false, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is false.\n- If \\( P \\) is false (irrespective of \\( Q \\)), \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true.\n\nGiven \\( \\neg P \\) (the bear was not in the cave), the conditional \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true regardless of the truth value of \\( Q \\). This means that \\( Q \\) (the wolf was in the den) could be either true or false, and the conditional statement would still hold. Therefore, the truth of \\( \\neg P \\) does not necessarily imply \\( \\neg Q \\) (the wolf was not in the den).\n\nSince the conclusion \\( \\neg Q \\) does not necessarily follow from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\), the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
