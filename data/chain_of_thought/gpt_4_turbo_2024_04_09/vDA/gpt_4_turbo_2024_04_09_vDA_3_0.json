            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the book was written by James\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \"The book was not written by James.\" This is the negation of \\( P \\), symbolically represented as \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is: \"The book is not a mystery novel.\" This is the negation of \\( Q \\), symbolically represented as \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if \\( \\neg P \\) (the book was not written by James) necessarily leads to \\( \\neg Q \\) (the book is not a mystery novel) given \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel).\n\nFrom the premises, we know:\n- If \\( P \\) (book written by James), then \\( Q \\) (it is a mystery novel).\n- \\( \\neg P \\) (book not written by James).\n\nHowever, the fact that the book was not written by James (\\( \\neg P \\)) does not logically imply that the book cannot be a mystery novel (\\( \\neg Q \\)). The book could still be a mystery novel even if it was written by someone other than James. The first premise only specifies a condition under which the book is definitely a mystery novel (if James wrote it), but it does not exclude the possibility of the book being a mystery novel under different circumstances (written by someone else).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg Q \\) does not necessarily follow from \\( \\neg P \\) given \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). The argument commits the logical fallacy of denying the antecedent, which is an invalid form of argument.\n\nAnswer: no",
