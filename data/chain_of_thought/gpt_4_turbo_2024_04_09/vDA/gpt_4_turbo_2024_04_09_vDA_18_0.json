            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be symbolically represented as P \u2192 Q, where P represents \"the doll was plastic\" and Q represents \"the truck was metal.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \"The doll was not plastic.\" This is the negation of P, symbolically represented as \u00acP.\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is \"The truck was not metal,\" which is the negation of Q, symbolically represented as \u00acQ.\n\nTo check the validity of the argument, we need to see if \u00acP (the doll was not plastic) necessarily leads to \u00acQ (the truck was not metal) given that P \u2192 Q (if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal).\n\nFrom the conditional statement P \u2192 Q, we know that if P is true, then Q must be true. However, if P is false (\u00acP), the conditional statement P \u2192 Q does not provide information about Q. In other words, Q could either be true or false when P is false. Therefore, \u00acP does not necessarily imply \u00acQ.\n\nSince the conclusion \u00acQ does not necessarily follow from \u00acP given P \u2192 Q, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
