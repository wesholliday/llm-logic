            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( J \\rightarrow A \\), where \\( J \\) stands for \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) stands for \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \"Jeff did not play basketball.\" Symbolically, this is \\( \\neg J \\) (not \\( J \\)).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is \"Amy did not play tennis,\" which can be represented as \\( \\neg A \\).\n\nTo check the validity of the argument, we need to see if the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. \n\nFrom the first premise \\( J \\rightarrow A \\), we know that if \\( J \\) is true, then \\( A \\) must be true. However, it does not tell us anything directly about the situation where \\( J \\) is false, which is the case here as per the second premise \\( \\neg J \\).\n\nThe truth table for a conditional statement \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) is:\n- If \\( J \\) is true and \\( A \\) is true, \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) is true.\n- If \\( J \\) is true and \\( A \\) is false, \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) is false.\n- If \\( J \\) is false and \\( A \\) is true, \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) is true.\n- If \\( J \\) is false and \\( A \\) is false, \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) is true.\n\nGiven \\( \\neg J \\) (Jeff did not play basketball), the conditional \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) does not restrict \\( A \\) from being true or false; \\( A \\) can be either true or false without affecting the truth of \\( J \\rightarrow A \\). Therefore, from \\( \\neg J \\), we cannot logically conclude \\( \\neg A \\) (Amy did not play tennis). The conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nThus, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion \\( \\neg A \\) does not necessarily follow from the premises \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) and \\( \\neg J \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
