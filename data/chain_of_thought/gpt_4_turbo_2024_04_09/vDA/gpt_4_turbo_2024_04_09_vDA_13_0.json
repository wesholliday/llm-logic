            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the car was red\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \"The car was not red.\" Symbolically, this is \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is: \"The truck was not blue,\" which can be symbolically represented as \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nTo evaluate the validity of the argument, we need to see if \\( \\neg P \\) (the car was not red) necessarily leads to \\( \\neg Q \\) (the truck was not blue) given the conditional \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nFrom the truth table of a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\):\n- If \\( P \\) is true and \\( Q \\) is true, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true.\n- If \\( P \\) is true and \\( Q \\) is false, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is false.\n- If \\( P \\) is false (which is our case, as the car was not red), \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true regardless of the truth value of \\( Q \\).\n\nSince \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true when \\( P \\) is false (regardless of \\( Q \\)), the truth of \\( \\neg P \\) does not necessarily imply the truth of \\( \\neg Q \\). The truck being blue or not is independent of the car's color when the car is not red. Therefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg Q \\) does not logically follow from \\( \\neg P \\) and \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nThus, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
