            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Tom watched football\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \"Tom did not watch football.\" This is the negation of \\( P \\), symbolically represented as \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is \"Jen did not watch basketball,\" which is the negation of \\( Q \\), symbolically represented as \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nTo check the validity of the argument, we need to see if \\( \\neg P \\) (Tom did not watch football) necessarily leads to \\( \\neg Q \\) (Jen did not watch basketball) given the conditional \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball).\n\nFrom the conditional \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), we know that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true. However, if \\( P \\) is false (as stated in the second premise), the conditional statement does not specify whether \\( Q \\) is true or false; \\( Q \\) could be either true or false independently of \\( P \\) in this scenario. Therefore, from \\( \\neg P \\), we cannot logically conclude \\( \\neg Q \\). The truth of \\( \\neg P \\) does not affect the truth value of \\( Q \\) based on the conditional statement provided.\n\nThus, the conclusion \\( \\neg Q \\) does not necessarily follow from the premises \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\). The argument is committing a logical fallacy often referred to as denying the antecedent, which is an invalid form of argument.\n\nAnswer: no",
