            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the shirt was cotton\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \"The shirt was not cotton.\" Symbolically, this is \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is: \"The pants were not denim,\" which can be represented as \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nTo evaluate the validity of the argument, we need to see if \\( \\neg P \\) (the shirt was not cotton) necessarily leads to \\( \\neg Q \\) (the pants were not denim) given the conditional \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nFrom the truth table of a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\):\n- If \\( P \\) is true and \\( Q \\) is true, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true.\n- If \\( P \\) is true and \\( Q \\) is false, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is false.\n- If \\( P \\) is false and \\( Q \\) is true, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true.\n- If \\( P \\) is false and \\( Q \\) is false, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true.\n\nGiven \\( \\neg P \\) (the shirt was not cotton), the conditional \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not provide information about \\( Q \\) (the pants were denim). \\( Q \\) could be either true or false, and \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) would still hold as true. Therefore, from \\( \\neg P \\), we cannot logically conclude \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nThus, the argument \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim; The shirt was not cotton; Therefore, the pants were not denim\" is not logically valid because the conclusion \\( \\neg Q \\) does not necessarily follow from \\( \\neg P \\) given \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
