            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"The apple was red\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \"The apple was not red.\" Symbolically, this is \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is: \"The banana was not yellow,\" which can be symbolically represented as \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nTo evaluate the validity of the argument, we need to check if the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. In logical terms, we need to see if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\) necessarily lead to \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nUsing the truth table method or logical implications:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true in all cases except where \\( P \\) is true and \\( Q \\) is false.\n- \\( \\neg P \\) states that \\( P \\) is false.\n\nFrom \\( \\neg P \\) (the apple was not red), we know nothing about \\( Q \\) (whether the banana was yellow or not) based solely on the conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). The conditional statement only specifies what happens if \\( P \\) is true; it does not provide information about the scenario when \\( P \\) is false.\n\nTherefore, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\), we cannot logically conclude \\( \\neg Q \\). The conclusion \\( \\neg Q \\) does not necessarily follow from \\( \\neg P \\) and \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). The argument is committing a logical fallacy often referred to as denying the antecedent.\n\nAnswer: no",
