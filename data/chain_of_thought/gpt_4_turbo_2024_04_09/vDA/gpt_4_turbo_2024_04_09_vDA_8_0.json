            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the vampire was awake\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \"The vampire was not awake.\" Symbolically, this is \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is: \"The mummy was not awake,\" which can be represented as \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nTo check the validity of the argument, we need to see if \\( \\neg P \\) (the vampire was not awake) and \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake) logically lead to \\( \\neg Q \\) (the mummy was not awake).\n\nFrom the truth table of a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\):\n- If \\( P \\) is true and \\( Q \\) is true, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true.\n- If \\( P \\) is true and \\( Q \\) is false, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is false.\n- If \\( P \\) is false (irrespective of \\( Q \\)), \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true.\n\nGiven \\( \\neg P \\) (the vampire was not awake), the conditional \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true regardless of the truth value of \\( Q \\). This means that \\( Q \\) (the mummy was awake) could be either true or false without affecting the truth of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). Therefore, \\( \\neg P \\) does not necessarily imply \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nThus, the conclusion \\( \\neg Q \\) does not necessarily follow from \\( \\neg P \\) and \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). The argument commits the fallacy of denying the antecedent, which is a logical fallacy where one incorrectly infers the negation of the consequent from the negation of the antecedent.\n\nAnswer: no",
