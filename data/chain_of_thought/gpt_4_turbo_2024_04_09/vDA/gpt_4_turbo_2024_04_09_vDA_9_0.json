            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" Symbolically, this is \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt,\" which can be represented as \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nThe argument structure is:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- \\( \\neg P \\)\n- Therefore, \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nTo evaluate the validity of this argument, we need to check if the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. From the truth table of a conditional statement, we know that \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is false only when \\( P \\) is true and \\( Q \\) is false. In all other cases, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true.\n\nGiven \\( \\neg P \\) (Lisa did not buy the red shirt), the conditional \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not provide any information about \\( Q \\) when \\( P \\) is false. The truth of \\( \\neg P \\) (Lisa did not buy the red shirt) does not affect the truth value of \\( Q \\) (Mark bought the blue shirt). Therefore, \\( \\neg P \\) does not logically lead to \\( \\neg Q \\). Mark could still have bought the blue shirt regardless of whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not.\n\nThus, the conclusion \\( \\neg Q \\) does not necessarily follow from the premises \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\). The argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
