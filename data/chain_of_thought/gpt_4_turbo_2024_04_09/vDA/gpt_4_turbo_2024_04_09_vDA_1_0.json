            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" This is the negation of \\( P \\), symbolically represented as \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is \"Sue was not at the wedding,\" which is the negation of \\( Q \\), symbolically represented as \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nThe argument structure here is attempting to infer \\( \\neg Q \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\). This is a form of argument known as denying the antecedent, which is a logical fallacy. The fallacy occurs because the truth of the conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not depend on \\( P \\) being true; it only specifies what happens if \\( P \\) is true. If \\( P \\) is false, \\( Q \\) can still be either true or false without contradicting the conditional statement.\n\nThus, the conclusion \\( \\neg Q \\) does not logically follow from the premises \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\). The argument is invalid because the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
