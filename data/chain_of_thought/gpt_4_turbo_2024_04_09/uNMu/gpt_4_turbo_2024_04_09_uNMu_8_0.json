The statement given is: \"It's not the case that the vampire must have been awake.\"\n2. This statement can be rephrased as: \"It is not necessarily true that the vampire was awake.\"\n3. Saying that it is not necessarily true that the vampire was awake implies that there is no requirement or certainty that the vampire was awake.\n4. If it is not necessarily true that the vampire was awake, then it is possible that the vampire was not awake.\n5. Therefore, from the statement, we can infer that there is a possibility that the vampire might not have been awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
