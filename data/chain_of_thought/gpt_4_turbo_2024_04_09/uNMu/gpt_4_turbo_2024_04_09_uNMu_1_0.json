This means that her presence at the wedding is not guaranteed or required by any condition stated.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding, since her attendance was not mandatory. Therefore, the statement allows for the possibility that Mary might not have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
