The statement \"Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" implies that there is no possibility other than Lisa buying the red shirt. It is a certainty.\n\n2. When we negate this statement to \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt,\" we are saying that it is not certain that Lisa bought the red shirt. This means there is at least one possibility where Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\n3. If there is at least one possibility where Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then it is true that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt,\" we can infer that \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
