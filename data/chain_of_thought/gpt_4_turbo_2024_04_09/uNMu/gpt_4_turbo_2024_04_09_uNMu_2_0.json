This does not confirm the griffin's presence or absence, but rather negates the certainty of its presence. Therefore, if it is not necessary that the griffin was in the forest, it is possible that the griffin was not in the forest. This possibility allows for the inference that the griffin might not have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
