This statement negates the necessity of the dog being inside. In other words, it is not necessarily true that the dog was inside.\n3. If it is not necessarily true that the dog was inside, then there is a possibility that the dog was not inside.\n4. Therefore, from the statement, we can infer that it is possible the dog might not have been inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
