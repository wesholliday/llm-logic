The statement given is: \"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag.\" This means that there is no necessity or obligation for the pen to be in the bag. It does not definitively state that the pen is not in the bag, only that it is not required to be there.\n\n2. The question asked is: \"Can we infer that the pen might not be in my bag?\" This question is asking if it is a possibility that the pen is not in the bag.\n\n3. From the statement, since the pen is not required to be in the bag, it is logically possible that the pen is not in the bag. The absence of necessity (the pen must be in the bag) allows for the possibility of the pen not being in the bag.\n\nTherefore, based on the statement provided, it is reasonable to infer that it might be possible for the pen not to be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
