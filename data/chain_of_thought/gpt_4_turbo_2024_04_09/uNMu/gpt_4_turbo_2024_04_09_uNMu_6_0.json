            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statement and its implications:\n\n1. The statement given is: \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\"\n2. This statement implies that there is no necessity or obligation for Sue to have chosen pizza. It does not definitively state what Sue chose, only that choosing pizza was not a requirement.\n3. The absence of necessity (must) does not confirm whether Sue chose pizza or not; it only opens the possibility that she could have chosen something else.\n4. Therefore, if it is not certain that Sue must have chosen pizza, it logically follows that there is a possibility that Sue might not have chosen pizza.\n\nBased on this reasoning:\n\nAnswer: yes",
