            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the relationship between the premise and the conclusion to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nPremise: \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\"\nThis statement suggests that there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding. In modal logic, this can be expressed as \"It is possible that Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nConclusion: \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\"\nThis statement asserts that it is not necessarily true that Mary was at the wedding. In modal logic, this can be expressed as \"It is not necessary that Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe premise, stating that it is possible Mary was not at the wedding, implies that Mary's attendance is not a necessity. If it were necessary that Mary was at the wedding, then it could not be possible that she was not there. Therefore, the premise that it is possible she was not there logically leads to the conclusion that it is not necessary that she was there.\n\nThus, the conclusion that \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" logically follows from the premise \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\" The argument is logically valid because if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
