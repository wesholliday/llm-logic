The statement \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is known as the contrapositive of \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\), not \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is actually \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), which states \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nThe inference \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is not valid logically because it does not necessarily follow from the original statement. For example, it is possible that Sue could still be at the wedding regardless of whether Mary was there or not, based on the information given.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
