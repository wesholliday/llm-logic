            "content": "To analyze the inference, let's break down the given statement and its potential inference:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" In logical terms, this can be written as: If A (apple is red), then B (banana is yellow). Symbolically, this is A \u2192 B.\n\n2. The statement you are asking about is: \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\" In logical terms, this is: If not A (apple is not red), then not B (banana is not yellow). Symbolically, this is \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB.\n\n3. To determine if the inference is valid, we need to check if \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB logically follows from A \u2192 B. This involves understanding the concept of contraposition in logic. The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of A \u2192 B is \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA.\n\n4. Comparing \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA (the contrapositive of the original statement) with \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB (the statement in question), we see that they are not the same. The contrapositive (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA) states that if the banana is not yellow, then the apple is not red. This is different from saying if the apple is not red, then the banana is not yellow.\n\n5. Therefore, from the statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,\" we cannot infer \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow,\" because these are not logically equivalent, and the inference does not hold based on the rules of logic.\n\nAnswer: no",
