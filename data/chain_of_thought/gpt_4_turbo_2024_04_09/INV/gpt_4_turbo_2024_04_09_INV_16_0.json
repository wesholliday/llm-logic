            "content": "To analyze the inference, let's break down the given statement and its potential inference:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"the shirt was cotton\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the pants were denim\".\n\n2. The statement we are asked to infer is: \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   where \\( \\neg P \\) is \"the shirt was not cotton\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"the pants were not denim\".\n\n3. To determine if \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), we need to understand the logical relationship. The inference \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is known as the inverse of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\n4. In logic, the truth of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not guarantee the truth of its inverse \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\). For example, if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, it means whenever \\( P \\) is true, \\( Q \\) must be true. However, if \\( P \\) is false (the shirt was not cotton), \\( Q \\) (the pants were denim) can still be true or false without violating the original statement.\n\n5. Therefore, from the statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim,\" because the original statement does not provide information about the scenario where the shirt is not cotton.\n\nAnswer: no",
