            "content": "To analyze the inference, let's break down the given statement and its potential inference:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: If P (doll is plastic), then Q (truck is metal).\n\n2. The statement you are asking about is: \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\" In logical terms, this would be: If not P (doll is not plastic), then not Q (truck is not metal).\n\n3. To determine if the second statement logically follows from the first, we need to understand the relationship between the two. The first statement (If P then Q) does not necessarily imply the second statement (If not P then not Q). This is because the first statement only specifies what happens when P is true (i.e., the doll is plastic). It does not specify what happens when P is false (i.e., the doll is not plastic).\n\n4. The inference from \"If P then Q\" to \"If not P then not Q\" is a logical fallacy known as denying the antecedent. This fallacy occurs when it is assumed that if the condition (P) is not met, the consequence (Q) will also not occur. However, Q might still occur independently of P.\n\n5. Therefore, from the statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
