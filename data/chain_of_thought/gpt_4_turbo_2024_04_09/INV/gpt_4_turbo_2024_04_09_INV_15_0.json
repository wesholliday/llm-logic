            "content": "To analyze the inference, let's break down the original statement and its potential implication:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Sam took a plane\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Erin took a train\".\n\n2. The statement we are asked to infer is: \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\" This can be represented as: \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\n3. To determine if the inference is valid, we need to check if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) logically implies \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\). The latter statement is known as the contrapositive of \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\), not \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\n4. The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), which is logically equivalent to \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). However, \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is not the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\); it is the inverse of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\n5. The truth of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not guarantee the truth of \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\). For example, if Sam did not take a plane, it does not necessarily mean that Erin did not take a train. Erin might still take a train regardless of Sam's mode of transportation.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
