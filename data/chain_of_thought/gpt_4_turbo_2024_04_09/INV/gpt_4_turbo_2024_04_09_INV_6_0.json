            "content": "To analyze the given statement and its inference, we start by understanding the logical structure of the original statement:\n\n\"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\"\n\nThis statement can be represented in logical form as:\nP \u2192 Q\nwhere P represents \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q represents \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\nThe statement P \u2192 Q is true in all cases except where P is true and Q is false. In other words, if Sue chose pizza, Bob must have chosen pasta for the statement to hold true.\n\nNow, let's consider the inference:\n\"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\"\n\nThis can be represented as:\n\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\nwhere \u00acP represents \"Sue did not choose pizza\" and \u00acQ represents \"Bob did not choose pasta.\"\n\nThe inference \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ is known as the inverse of the original statement P \u2192 Q. Logically, the truth of P \u2192 Q does not guarantee the truth of \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ. The inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. To see why, consider a situation where Sue did not choose pizza (\u00acP is true), but Bob still chose pasta (Q is true). This situation makes \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ false but does not affect the truth of P \u2192 Q.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
