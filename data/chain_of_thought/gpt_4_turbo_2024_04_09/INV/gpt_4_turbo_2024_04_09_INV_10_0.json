            "content": "To analyze the inference, let's break down the given statement and its potential inference:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" In logical terms, this can be expressed as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"the dog was inside\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the cat was outside\".\n\n2. The statement we are asked to infer is: \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.\" This can be expressed as:\n   \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   where \\( \\neg P \\) is \"the dog was not inside\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"the cat was not outside\".\n\n3. To determine if \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), we need to check if these statements are logically equivalent or if one implies the other. The statement \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is known as the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent. Therefore, if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, then \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) must also be true.\n\n4. Since the contrapositive of a statement is always true if the original statement is true, we can conclude that if \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" is true, then \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
