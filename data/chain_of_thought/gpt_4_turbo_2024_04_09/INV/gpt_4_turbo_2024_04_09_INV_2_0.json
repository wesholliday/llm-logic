            "content": "To analyze the inference, let's break down the given statement and the proposed inference:\n\n1. Given statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n   - This can be represented as: If G (griffin in the forest), then U (unicorn in the forest).\n   - In logical terms: G \u2192 U.\n\n2. Proposed inference: \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\"\n   - This can be represented as: If not G, then not U.\n   - In logical terms: \u00acG \u2192 \u00acU.\n\nTo determine if the inference is valid, we need to check if \u00acG \u2192 \u00acU logically follows from G \u2192 U. This involves understanding the concept of contraposition in logic.\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of G \u2192 U is \u00acU \u2192 \u00acG. This means \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nHowever, the proposed inference \u00acG \u2192 \u00acU is not the contrapositive of the original statement but rather its inverse. The inverse of a statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot assume that \u00acG \u2192 \u00acU is true just because G \u2192 U is true.\n\nThus, from the statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest,\" we cannot logically infer \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
