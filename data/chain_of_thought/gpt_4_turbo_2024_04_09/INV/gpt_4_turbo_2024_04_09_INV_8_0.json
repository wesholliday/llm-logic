            "content": "To analyze the inference, let's break down the given statement and its potential implication:\n\n1. The given statement is: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) (where \\( V \\) represents \"the vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the mummy was awake\").\n\n2. The statement we are asked to infer is: \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\" In logical terms, this is represented as: \\( \\neg V \\rightarrow \\neg M \\).\n\n3. To determine if the inference is valid, we need to check if \\( \\neg V \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) logically follows from \\( V \\rightarrow M \\).\n\n4. The contrapositive of \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) is \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg V \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\n\n5. Comparing \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg V \\) with \\( \\neg V \\rightarrow \\neg M \\), we see that these are not the same. The first states that if the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake. The second states that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\n\n6. The truth of \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) does not guarantee the truth of \\( \\neg V \\rightarrow \\neg M \\). For example, it is possible that the vampire sleeps while the mummy remains awake due to different conditions affecting their awakeness.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
