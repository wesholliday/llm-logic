Given statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement of the form: If P, then Q.\n   - Here, P is \"Alex finished the race\" and Q is \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\n2. Proposed inference: \"If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race.\"\n   - This is another conditional statement of the form: If not P, then not Q.\n\nTo determine if the proposed inference logically follows from the given statement, we need to understand the logical relationship between P and Q.\n\n- The original statement (If P, then Q) asserts that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. However, it does not specify what happens when P is false. Q could either be true or false when P is false.\n\n- The proposed inference (If not P, then not Q) is a form of the logical fallacy known as \"denying the antecedent.\" This fallacy occurs when one assumes that the falsity of the antecedent (P) necessarily implies the falsity of the consequent (Q).\n\n- To see why this is a fallacy, consider an example:\n  Suppose Alex and Chris are in a race where finishing depends on reaching a certain checkpoint. If Alex reaches the checkpoint (finishes the race), then Chris, following the same path, also reaches the checkpoint (finishes the race). However, if Alex does not reach the checkpoint (does not finish the race), it doesn't necessarily mean Chris also failed to reach the checkpoint; Chris might have taken a different path or had a different outcome.\n\nThus, from the statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race,\" because the original statement does not provide information about the scenario where Alex does not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
