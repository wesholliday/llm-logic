            "content": "To analyze the question, we need to understand the logical relationship expressed in the statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This is a conditional statement, often represented in logic as: If P, then Q. Here, P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nThe statement \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis\" is a different conditional statement. In logical terms, it is saying: If not P, then not Q. This is known as the inverse of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the truth of a conditional statement (If P, then Q) does not necessarily imply the truth of its inverse (If not P, then not Q). The truth of the original statement only tells us that whenever P happens, Q must also happen. It does not tell us anything about the situation where P does not happen; Q could either happen or not happen in that case.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
