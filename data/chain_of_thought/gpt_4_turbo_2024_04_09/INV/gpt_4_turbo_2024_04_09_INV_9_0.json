            "content": "To analyze the inference, let's break down the given statement and its potential implication:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented in logical form as: \n   \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( M \\) represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The statement we are asked to evaluate is: \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\( \\neg L \\rightarrow \\neg M \\)\n\n3. To determine if \\( \\neg L \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) follows from \\( L \\rightarrow M \\), we need to understand the logical relationship. The statement \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) is true in all cases except where Lisa bought the red shirt and Mark did not buy the blue shirt. It does not specify what happens when Lisa does not buy the red shirt; Mark could either buy the blue shirt or not.\n\n4. The inference \\( \\neg L \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) (if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt) suggests a specific outcome (Mark not buying the blue shirt) based solely on Lisa not buying the red shirt. However, from \\( L \\rightarrow M \\), we cannot confirm this because the truth of \\( M \\) (Mark buying the blue shirt) is not dependent on \\( \\neg L \\) (Lisa not buying the red shirt). Mark could still buy the blue shirt regardless of Lisa's action.\n\n5. Therefore, the statement \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" is not a necessary conclusion from \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" It introduces a condition about Mark's action that is not supported by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
