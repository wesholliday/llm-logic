            "content": "To analyze the inference, let's break down the given statement and its potential implication:\n\n1. The given statement is: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be represented in logical form as: If P (the book was written by James), then Q (the book is a mystery novel).\n\n2. The statement you are asking about is: \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as: If not P (the book was not written by James), then not Q (the book is not a mystery novel).\n\n3. The original statement (If P then Q) does not necessarily imply the second statement (If not P then not Q). The original statement only specifies what happens if P is true. It does not specify what happens if P is false. \n\n4. The fallacy of assuming that \"If not P then not Q\" from \"If P then Q\" is known as denying the antecedent. This is a logical fallacy because the truth of P being a sufficient condition for Q does not imply that P is a necessary condition for Q. In other words, just because all books written by James are mystery novels, it does not mean that books not written by James cannot be mystery novels. There could be other authors who also write mystery novels.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
