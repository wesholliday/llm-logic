            "content": "To analyze the inference, let's break down the given statement and its potential implication:\n\n1. The original statement is a conditional: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" In logical terms, this can be written as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where:\n   - \\( P \\) represents \"Joe went to the park\"\n   - \\( Q \\) represents \"Lucy went to the zoo\"\n\n2. The statement you are asking about is \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" This can be written as \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), where:\n   - \\( \\neg P \\) represents \"Joe did not go to the park\"\n   - \\( \\neg Q \\) represents \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\"\n\n3. To determine if \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) (the contrapositive) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), we need to understand the logical relationship:\n   - The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, then \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is also true.\n\n4. However, \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is not the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\); it is actually the inverse of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). The inverse of a statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement. Just because the original conditional is true does not mean its inverse is also true.\n\n5. Therefore, from the statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo,\" we cannot logically infer \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\" without additional information. The truth of the original statement does not determine the truth of its inverse.\n\nAnswer: no",
