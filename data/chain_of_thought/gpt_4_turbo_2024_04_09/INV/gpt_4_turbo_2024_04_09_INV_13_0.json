            "content": "To analyze the inference, let's break down the given statement and its potential inference:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"the car was red\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the truck was blue\".\n\n2. The statement we are asked to infer is: \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as:\n   \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   where \\( \\neg P \\) is \"the car was not red\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"the truck was not blue\".\n\n3. To determine if \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), we need to understand the logical relationship. The inference \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is known as the contrapositive of \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\) (not \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)). The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. However, \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\) is not the same as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) unless \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) are equivalent (i.e., \\( P \\leftrightarrow Q \\)).\n\n4. Without additional information that \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) are equivalent, we cannot assume that \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\) (and thus its contrapositive \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)) holds true just because \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does. The truth of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not necessarily imply the truth of \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) unless \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) are equivalent.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\" without additional information.\n\nAnswer: no",
