            "content": "To analyze the given statement and the inference, let's break down the logic:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: If P, then Q (where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball\").\n\n2. The statement you are asking about is: \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\" This can be represented as: If not P, then not Q.\n\n3. The logical relationship in the original statement (If P, then Q) does not necessarily imply the relationship in the second statement (If not P, then not Q). The second statement is known as the inverse of the original statement.\n\n4. To see why the inference does not necessarily hold, consider a scenario where both Tom and Jen have independent decisions about watching their respective sports. It's possible that Tom didn't watch football, but Jen still decided to watch basketball. This scenario would make the original statement true (since it only specifies what happens if Tom does watch football) but would make the second statement false.\n\n5. Therefore, from the statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
