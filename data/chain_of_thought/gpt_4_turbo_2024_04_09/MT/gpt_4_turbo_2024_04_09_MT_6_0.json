            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the given statements.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"Sue chose pizza\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Bob did not choose pasta.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( \\neg Q \\)\n   where \\( \\neg Q \\) represents the negation of \\( Q \\).\n\n3. We need to determine whether these statements imply that \"Sue did not choose pizza\" (\\( \\neg P \\)).\n\n4. Using the rules of logic, particularly the contrapositive, we know that the contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), we can infer \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\n5. Given \\( \\neg Q \\) (Bob did not choose pasta), and knowing \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) (if Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza), we can conclude \\( \\neg P \\) (Sue did not choose pizza).\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
