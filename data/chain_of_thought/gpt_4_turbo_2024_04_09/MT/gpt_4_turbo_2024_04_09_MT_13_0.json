            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the logical form of the statements and apply the rules of logic.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" In logical terms, this can be written as: \n   \\( R \\rightarrow B \\)\n   where \\( R \\) represents \"the car was red\" and \\( B \\) represents \"the truck was blue.\"\n\n2. The second statement is a negation: \"The truck was not blue.\" In logical terms, this is:\n   \\( \\neg B \\)\n\n3. We need to determine whether these statements together imply that \"The car was not red,\" which in logical terms is \\( \\neg R \\).\n\n4. Using the rules of logic, particularly modus tollens, we can analyze the implications. Modus tollens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) are true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\n5. Applying modus tollens to our statements:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) corresponds to \\( R \\rightarrow B \\) (If the car was red, then the truck was blue).\n   - \\( \\neg Q \\) corresponds to \\( \\neg B \\) (The truck was not blue).\n\n   Since both \\( R \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\) are given as true, modus tollens allows us to conclude \\( \\neg R \\) (The car was not red).\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
