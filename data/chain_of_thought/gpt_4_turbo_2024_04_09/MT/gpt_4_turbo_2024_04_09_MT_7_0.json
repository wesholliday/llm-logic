In logical terms, A \u2192 C.\n\n2. \"Chris did not finish the race.\" This statement tells us that C is false.\n\nFrom the implication A \u2192 C, we know that if A is true (Alex finished the race), then C must also be true (Chris finished the race). However, we know from the second statement that C is false (Chris did not finish the race).\n\nGiven that C is false, and knowing that A \u2192 C (if A then C), A must also be false to maintain the truth of the implication. This is because if A were true, then C would also have to be true, which contradicts our information that C is false.\n\nTherefore, from the statements provided, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
