            "content": "To solve this, we can use logical reasoning based on the given statements:\n\n1. \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This can be represented as: If P, then Q (where P = Sam took a plane, Q = Erin took a train).\n\n2. \"Erin did not take a train.\" This can be represented as: Not Q.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, from the second statement, we know that Q is false (Erin did not take a train).\n\nUsing the rule of contraposition in logic, which states that \"If P then Q\" is logically equivalent to \"If not Q then not P,\" we can apply it here:\n\nSince Q is false (Not Q), then P must also be false (Not P) according to the contraposition of the first statement.\n\nTherefore, if Erin did not take a train, Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
