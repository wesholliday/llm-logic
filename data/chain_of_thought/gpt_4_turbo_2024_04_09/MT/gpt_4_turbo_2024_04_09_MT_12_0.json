            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the statements given:\n\n1. \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This is a conditional statement which can be represented as: If P, then Q (where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo\").\n\n2. \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" This is a negation of Q, represented as \u00acQ.\n\nWe need to determine whether these statements allow us to infer \u00acP (\"Joe did not go to the park\").\n\nFrom the conditional statement (If P, then Q), we know that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, we are given that Q is false (Lucy did not go to the zoo). In a conditional statement, if the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false to maintain the truth of the conditional statement. This is because a true conditional statement cannot have a true antecedent and a false consequent.\n\nSince Q (Lucy went to the zoo) is false, and the conditional statement must remain true, P (Joe went to the park) must also be false. Therefore, Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
