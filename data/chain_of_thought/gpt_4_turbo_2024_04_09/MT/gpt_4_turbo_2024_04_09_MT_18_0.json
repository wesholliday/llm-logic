However, we are given \\( \\neg M \\) (the truck was not metal), which means \\( M \\) is false.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, if \\( P \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( M \\) is false, then \\( P \\) must also be false to maintain the truth of the implication. This is because the only way \\( P \\rightarrow M \\) can be true when \\( M \\) is false is if \\( P \\) is also false.\n\nTherefore, from \\( \\neg M \\) and \\( P \\rightarrow M \\), we can infer \\( \\neg P \\) (the doll was not plastic).\n\nAnswer: yes",
