This means \"if the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\"\n\nGiven \\( \\neg B \\) (\"The banana was not yellow\"), and knowing \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) (from the contraposition of the original statement), we can conclude \\( \\neg A \\) (\"The apple was not red\").\n\nAnswer: yes",
