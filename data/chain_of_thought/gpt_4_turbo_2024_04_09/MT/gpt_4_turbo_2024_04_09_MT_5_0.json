            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the given statements.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be written in logical form as: \n   \\( J \\rightarrow A \\)\n   where \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) represents \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Amy did not play tennis.\" In logical form, this is:\n   \\( \\neg A \\)\n   where \\( \\neg \\) denotes negation.\n\n3. We need to determine whether these statements imply \"Jeff did not play basketball,\" which can be written as:\n   \\( \\neg J \\)\n\n4. Using the rules of logic, particularly modus tollens, we can analyze the implications. Modus tollens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true and \\( \\neg Q \\) is true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\n5. Applying modus tollens to our scenario:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) corresponds to \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis).\n   - \\( \\neg Q \\) corresponds to \\( \\neg A \\) (Amy did not play tennis).\n   - Therefore, \\( \\neg P \\) must be true, which corresponds to \\( \\neg J \\) (Jeff did not play basketball).\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can logically infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
