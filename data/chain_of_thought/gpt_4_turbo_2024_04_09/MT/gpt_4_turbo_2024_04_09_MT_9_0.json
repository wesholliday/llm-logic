            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the given statements.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" In logical terms, this can be written as: \n   \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( M \\) represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\( \\neg M \\)\n   where \\( \\neg M \\) means \"It is not the case that Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n3. We need to determine whether these statements imply that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt,\" which can be represented as:\n   \\( \\neg L \\)\n\n4. Using the rules of logic, particularly modus tollens, we can analyze the implications. Modus tollens is a rule that states if \\( p \\rightarrow q \\) is true and \\( \\neg q \\) is true, then \\( \\neg p \\) must also be true.\n\n5. Applying modus tollens to our scenario:\n   - \\( p \\rightarrow q \\) corresponds to \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n   - \\( \\neg q \\) corresponds to \\( \\neg M \\)\n   - Therefore, \\( \\neg p \\) which corresponds to \\( \\neg L \\) must be true.\n\n6. Thus, from the statements \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" and \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt,\" we can logically infer that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
