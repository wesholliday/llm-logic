            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the given statements. We have two statements:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n2. The mummy was not awake.\n\nWe can represent these statements using propositional logic:\n- Let \\( V \\) represent \"The vampire was awake.\"\n- Let \\( M \\) represent \"The mummy was awake.\"\n\nThe first statement can be written as:\n\\[ V \\implies M \\]\nThis means if \\( V \\) is true (the vampire was awake), then \\( M \\) must also be true (the mummy was awake).\n\nThe second statement can be written as:\n\\[ \\neg M \\]\nThis means \\( M \\) is false (the mummy was not awake).\n\nNow, we need to determine whether these statements allow us to conclude \\( \\neg V \\) (the vampire was not awake).\n\nFrom \\( V \\implies M \\), we know that if \\( V \\) were true, then \\( M \\) would have to be true. However, we know from \\( \\neg M \\) that \\( M \\) is false. Therefore, \\( V \\) must also be false to maintain the truth of \\( V \\implies M \\). If \\( V \\) were true, it would contradict the truth of \\( \\neg M \\).\n\nThus, from \\( V \\implies M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\), we can logically infer \\( \\neg V \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
