(Where M = Mary was at the wedding, S = Sue was at the wedding).\n\n2. \"Sue was not at the wedding.\" This can be represented as: Not S.\n\nWe need to determine if these statements allow us to infer \"Mary was not at the wedding\" (Not M).\n\nFrom statement 1 (If M, then S), we know that Mary being at the wedding implies Sue must also be at the wedding. \n\nStatement 2 (Not S) tells us that Sue was definitely not at the wedding.\n\nUsing modus tollens, a rule of inference in logic, we can infer from these statements:\n- If M implies S, and Not S is true, then Not M must also be true.\n\nTherefore, since Sue was not at the wedding, Mary could not have been at the wedding either without contradicting the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
