Symbolically, this is G \u2192 U.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the unicorn was not in the forest, which is \u00acU (not U).\n\nWe need to determine whether these statements together imply that the griffin was not in the forest, \u00acG.\n\nFrom the conditional statement G \u2192 U, we know that if G is true, then U must also be true. However, we know from the second statement that U is false (\u00acU). In logic, if a conditional statement (G \u2192 U) is true and the consequent (U) is false, then the antecedent (G) must also be false to maintain the truth of the conditional statement. This is because a true conditional statement cannot have a true antecedent and a false consequent.\n\nTherefore, since U is false and the conditional statement G \u2192 U is assumed true, G must also be false to avoid a logical contradiction.\n\nThus, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
