            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use logical reasoning, specifically the concept of contraposition in conditional statements.\n\n1. We start with the conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" In logical form, this can be written as: \n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"the book was written by James\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. We know that the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the statement itself. The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), which translates to \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\"\n\n3. We are given the additional information that \"The book is not a mystery novel.\" This is \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n4. Applying the contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and knowing \\( \\neg Q \\) (the book is not a mystery novel), we can infer \\( \\neg P \\) (the book was not written by James).\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
