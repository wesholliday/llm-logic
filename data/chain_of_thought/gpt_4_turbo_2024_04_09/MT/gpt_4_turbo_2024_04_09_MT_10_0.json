Let's denote:\n- \\( P \\) as \"the dog was inside\"\n- \\( Q \\) as \"the cat was outside\"\n\nThe statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" can be written as:\n\\[ P \\implies Q \\]\n\nWe are also given that \"The cat was not outside\", which can be written as:\n\\[ \\neg Q \\]\n\nWe need to determine if from these two statements we can infer \\( P \\) (the dog was inside).\n\nUsing the implication \\( P \\implies Q \\), we know that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must also be true. However, we know \\( \\neg Q \\) is true (the cat was not outside). \n\nIf \\( P \\) were true (the dog was inside), then \\( Q \\) would also have to be true (the cat was outside) according to the implication. But this contradicts the information that \\( \\neg Q \\) (the cat was not outside) is true. Therefore, \\( P \\) (the dog was inside) must be false.\n\nThus, from the given statements, we cannot infer that the dog was inside. In fact, we infer the opposite, that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: no",
