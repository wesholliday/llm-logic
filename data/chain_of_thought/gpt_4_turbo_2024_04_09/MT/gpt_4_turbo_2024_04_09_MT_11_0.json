            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the logical form of the statements provided and apply the rules of logic to infer the conclusion.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" In logical form, this can be written as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"the cake was chocolate\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\n2. The second statement is a negation: \"The muffins were not blueberry.\" In logical form, this is:\n   \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. We need to determine whether these statements allow us to conclude that \"The cake was not chocolate,\" which in logical form is \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n4. Using the rules of logic, particularly Modus Tollens, we can analyze the statements. Modus Tollens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) are both true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\n5. Applying Modus Tollens:\n   - From \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry)\n   - and \\( \\neg Q \\) (The muffins were not blueberry),\n   - we can conclude \\( \\neg P \\) (The cake was not chocolate).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical analysis using Modus Tollens, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
