            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the given statements. \n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be written in logical form as: \n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"Tom watched football\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Jen did not watch basketball.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( \\neg Q \\)\n   where \\( \\neg Q \\) denotes the negation of \\( Q \\).\n\n3. We need to determine whether these statements imply \\( \\neg P \\) (\"Tom did not watch football\").\n\n4. Using the rules of logic, particularly modus tollens, we know that:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) imply \\( \\neg P \\).\n   Modus tollens states that if \"if P then Q\" is true and Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\n5. Applying modus tollens to our statements:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is given as \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n   - \\( \\neg Q \\) is given as \"Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n   - Therefore, \\( \\neg P \\) must be true, which means \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
