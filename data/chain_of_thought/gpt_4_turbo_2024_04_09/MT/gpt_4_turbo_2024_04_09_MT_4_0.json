If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n2. The robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nWe can represent the first statement as a conditional statement: \\( A \\rightarrow R \\), where:\n- \\( A \\) = The alien visited Mars.\n- \\( R \\) = The robot visited Jupiter.\n\nThe second statement can be represented as \\( \\neg R \\) (the robot did not visit Jupiter).\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens, if we have a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow R \\) and the negation of the consequent \\( \\neg R \\), we can infer the negation of the antecedent \\( \\neg A \\). This is because if the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false for the original conditional statement to hold true.\n\nThus, from \\( A \\rightarrow R \\) and \\( \\neg R \\), we can infer \\( \\neg A \\) (the alien did not visit Mars).\n\nAnswer: yes",
