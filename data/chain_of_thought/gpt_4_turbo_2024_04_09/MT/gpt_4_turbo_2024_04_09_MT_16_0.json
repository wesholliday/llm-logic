            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the given statements. We have two statements:\n\n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. (If A, then B)\n2. The pants were not denim. (Not B)\n\nWe need to determine if these statements allow us to infer that the shirt was not cotton (Not A).\n\nUsing the logical rule known as modus tollens, we can derive a conclusion from these two premises. Modus tollens states that if \"If A, then B\" is true, and B is false (Not B), then A must also be false (Not A). \n\nApplying this to the given statements:\n- \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" translates to \"If A, then B\".\n- \"The pants were not denim\" translates to \"Not B\".\n\nSince both conditions of modus tollens are met (If A, then B is given, and Not B is true), we can conclude Not A, which in this context means the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
