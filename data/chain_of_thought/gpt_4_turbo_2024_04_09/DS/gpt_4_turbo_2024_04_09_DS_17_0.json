This rule states that if we have a disjunction (A or B) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (not B), then the other must be true (A). \n\nApplying this to the given statements:\n- A or B: The scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it is draped on the coat rack.\n- Not B: The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude:\n- A: The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
