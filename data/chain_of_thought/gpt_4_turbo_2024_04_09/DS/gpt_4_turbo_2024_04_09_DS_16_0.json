It states that one of the two conditions must be true, but does not specify that only one must be true\u2014it allows for the possibility that both could be true, though in this case, it seems to imply at least one must definitely be true.\n\nThe second statement provides a definite condition: the pen is not on the desk.\n\nGiven that the first statement says the pen must be either in the bag or on the desk, and the second statement eliminates the possibility of the pen being on the desk, the only remaining possibility from the given options is that the pen is in the bag.\n\nTherefore, based on these premises, we can infer that the pen must be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
