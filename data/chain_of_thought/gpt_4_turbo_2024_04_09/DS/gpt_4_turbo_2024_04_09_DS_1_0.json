            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given:\n\n1. \"Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden.\" This is a logical disjunction (an \"or\" statement). It asserts that at least one of the following conditions is true: Fido is inside, or Fido is in the garden.\n\n2. \"Fido is not in the garden.\" This is a negation of one of the conditions in the disjunction.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically the rule of disjunction elimination, if we have a disjunction (A or B) and we know that one of the components of the disjunction is false (not B), then the other component must be true (A). Applying this to the statements:\n\n- A: Fido is inside.\n- B: Fido is in the garden.\n- We know not B (Fido is not in the garden).\n\nSince the disjunction (A or B) must be true and B is false (Fido is not in the garden), A must be true. Therefore, Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
