The first statement is: \"Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\" This can be represented as: A or B.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\" This negates the first part of the previous statement, meaning Not A.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use the logical rule of disjunction elimination. According to this rule, if we have A or B, and we know Not A, then B must be true.\n\nTherefore, if it's not the case that the puzzle piece is blending in on the floor (Not A), and the only other option provided was that it is in the box (B), then it must be true that the puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
