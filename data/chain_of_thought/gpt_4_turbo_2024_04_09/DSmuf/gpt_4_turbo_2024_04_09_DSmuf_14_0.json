It asserts that one of the following two conditions must be true:\n- The milk must be chilling in the fridge.\n- The milk is on the counter.\n\nThe second statement negates the first condition of the disjunction:\n- It is not true that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\n\nGiven that in a disjunction (A or B), if A is false, then B must be true to satisfy the disjunction, we can analyze the given statements:\n- Since it is not true that the milk must be chilling in the fridge, the only remaining possibility that satisfies the disjunction is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical analysis of the statements, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
