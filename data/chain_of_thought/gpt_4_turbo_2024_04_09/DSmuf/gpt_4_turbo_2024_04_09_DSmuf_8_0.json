            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given:\n\n1. \"Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table.\"\n   This statement is a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" statement). It can be represented as:\n   \\( A \\lor B \\)\n   where \\( A \\) is \"the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" and \\( B \\) is \"the remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n   This statement is a negation of \\( A \\). It can be represented as:\n   \\( \\neg A \\)\n\nGiven these representations, we can use the logical rule of disjunction elimination. According to this rule, if \\( A \\lor B \\) is true and \\( \\neg A \\) is true, then \\( B \\) must be true. This is because the truth of \\( A \\lor B \\) means at least one of \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) must be true. If \\( A \\) is definitely not true (\\( \\neg A \\)), then \\( B \\) must be true to satisfy the truth of \\( A \\lor B \\).\n\nThus, from the statements provided:\n- \"Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table\" (i.e., \\( A \\lor B \\))\n- \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" (i.e., \\( \\neg A \\))\n\nWe can infer:\n- \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" (i.e., \\( B \\)).\n\nAnswer: yes",
