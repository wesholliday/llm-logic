It asserts that one of the following two conditions must be true:\n- The umbrella is tucked away in the closet.\n- The umbrella is in the car.\n\nThe second statement negates the first condition of the disjunction:\n- It is not true that the umbrella is tucked away in the closet.\n\nGiven that in a disjunction (A or B), if A is false, then B must be true to satisfy the disjunction, we can apply this logic here:\n- Since it is not true that the umbrella is tucked away in the closet, the only remaining possibility that satisfies the original disjunction is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and the rules of logical inference, we can conclude:\n\nAnswer: yes",
