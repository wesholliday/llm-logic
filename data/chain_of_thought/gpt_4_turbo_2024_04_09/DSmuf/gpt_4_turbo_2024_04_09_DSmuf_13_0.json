            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given:\n\n1. The first statement is: \"Either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box.\" This can be represented as: \\( A \\vee B \\), where \\( A \\) is \"the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" and \\( B \\) is \"the toy is in the toy box.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\" This can be represented as: \\( \\neg A \\).\n\nGiven these representations, we can use the logical rule of disjunction elimination. According to this rule, if \\( A \\vee B \\) is true and \\( \\neg A \\) is true, then \\( B \\) must be true. This is because the truth of \\( A \\vee B \\) means either \\( A \\) is true, or \\( B \\) is true, or both. Since \\( \\neg A \\) (the negation of \\( A \\)) is true, \\( A \\) is false, leaving \\( B \\) as the only possibility for \\( A \\vee B \\) to hold true.\n\nTherefore, from the statements provided, we can infer that \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
