It asserts that at least one of the following conditions must be true:\n- Fido must be in the garden.\n- Fido is inside.\n\nThe second statement negates the first condition of the disjunction:\n- It is not true that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nGiven that the disjunction (the first statement) must be true, and one of its conditions (Fido must be in the garden) is false (as stated in the second statement), the rules of disjunction in logic dictate that the other condition must be true to satisfy the truth of the disjunction.\n\nTherefore, since it is not the case that Fido must be in the garden, the only remaining possibility that satisfies the disjunction is that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
