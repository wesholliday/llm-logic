It states that one of the following two conditions must be true:\n- The book must be resting on the table.\n- The book is on the shelf.\n\nThe second statement negates the first condition of the disjunction:\n- It is not true that the book must be resting on the table.\n\nGiven that in a disjunction (A or B), if A is false, then B must be true to satisfy the disjunction, we can apply this logic here:\n- Since it is not true that the book must be resting on the table, the only remaining possibility that satisfies the original disjunction is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
