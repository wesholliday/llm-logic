It states that there are two possibilities:\n- The notebook is in the drawer.\n- The notebook is on the nightstand.\n\nThe second statement introduces a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand. However, it does not confirm that the notebook is definitely not on the nightstand; it only opens up the possibility that it might not be there.\n\nTo infer that \"The notebook is in the drawer\" with certainty, we would need definitive proof that the notebook is not on the nightstand. The second statement, however, only suggests that it's possible the notebook isn't on the nightstand, not that it definitely isn't there.\n\nSince the second statement does not confirm the absence of the notebook from the nightstand, we cannot conclusively infer that the notebook must be in the drawer based solely on these statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
