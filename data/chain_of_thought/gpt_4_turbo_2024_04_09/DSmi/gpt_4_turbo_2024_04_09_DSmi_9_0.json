The first statement is: \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor.\" This is a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" statement), which means that at least one of the conditions must be true. Therefore, if the puzzle piece is not in the box, it must be blending in on the floor, and vice versa.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor.\" The use of \"might not\" indicates a possibility but does not confirm that the puzzle piece is definitely not blending in on the floor. It leaves open the possibility that the puzzle piece could still be blending in on the floor.\n\nGiven these considerations, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box\" based solely on these statements. The possibility that the puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor does not eliminate the possibility that it could still be blending in on the floor. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that it must be in the box.\n\nAnswer: no",
