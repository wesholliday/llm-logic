It states that there are two possibilities:\n- The keys are in the drawer.\n- The keys are dangling in the cabinet.\n\nThe second statement introduces a possibility that the keys might not be in the cabinet. However, it does not confirm that the keys are definitely not in the cabinet; it only opens up the possibility that they might not be there.\n\nTo infer that \"The keys are in the drawer\" with certainty, we would need a definitive statement that the keys are not in the cabinet. Since the second statement only suggests a possibility and does not confirm the absence of the keys from the cabinet, we cannot conclusively infer that the keys must be in the drawer based solely on these statements.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether we can infer that \"The keys are in the drawer\" from the given statements is:\n\nAnswer: no",
