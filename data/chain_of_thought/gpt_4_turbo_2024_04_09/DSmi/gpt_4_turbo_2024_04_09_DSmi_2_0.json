It states that there are two possibilities:\n- The book is on the shelf.\n- The book is resting on the table.\n\nThe second statement introduces a possibility that the book might not be on the table. However, it does not confirm that the book is definitely not on the table; it only opens up the possibility that the book might not be there.\n\nTo infer \"The book is on the shelf\" with certainty, we would need definitive proof that the book is not on the table. The second statement, however, only suggests that it's possible for the book not to be on the table, not that it definitely isn't. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that the book must be on the shelf based solely on these statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
