            "content": "Explanation: The original statement, \"The interview might be challenging and involve multiple rounds,\" explicitly mentions that the interview might involve multiple rounds as part of its description. The use of \"and\" in the sentence connects two possibilities about the interview: being challenging and involving multiple rounds. Therefore, the inference that \"The interview might involve multiple rounds\" is directly supported by the part of the sentence following \"and.\" Since this part of the statement is a straightforward extraction from the original sentence, it logically follows that the inference is correct.\n\nAnswer: yes",
