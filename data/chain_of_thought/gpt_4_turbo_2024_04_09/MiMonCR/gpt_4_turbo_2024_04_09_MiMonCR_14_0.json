            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is \"The meeting might be confidential and involve important decisions.\" This statement suggests two possibilities about the meeting: it might be confidential, and it might involve important decisions. The use of \"and\" connects these two ideas, indicating that both conditions could be true simultaneously. However, the inference in question focuses solely on the latter part of the statement: whether the meeting might involve important decisions.\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we need to consider if the original statement logically supports the conclusion that the meeting might involve important decisions. Since the original statement explicitly states that the meeting \"might involve important decisions,\" it directly supports the inference. The confidentiality of the meeting is an additional detail but does not negate or conflict with the fact that the meeting might involve important decisions.\n\nTherefore, the inference that \"The meeting might involve important decisions\" is directly supported by the original statement, regardless of the meeting's potential confidentiality.\n\nAnswer: yes",
