It states that one of the two conditions must be true: either the phone is ringing in the kitchen, or the phone is in the living room.\n\nThe second statement negates the first part of the disjunction: the phone is not ringing in the kitchen.\n\nGiven that in a disjunction (A or B), if A is false, then B must be true to satisfy the statement, we can conclude that since the phone is not ringing in the kitchen, it must be in the living room to satisfy the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
