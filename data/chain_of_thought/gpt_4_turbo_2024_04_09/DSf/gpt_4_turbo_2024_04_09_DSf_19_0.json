It states that there are two possibilities:\n- The watch is on his wrist.\n- The watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nThe second statement provides a specific fact:\n- The watch is not on his wrist.\n\nGiven that the first statement establishes a choice between two exclusive options, and the second statement eliminates one of these options (the watch being on his wrist), the only remaining possibility from the original disjunction is that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nTherefore, from these premises, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
