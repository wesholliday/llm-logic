            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given:\n\n1. \"Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside.\" This is a logical disjunction (an \"or\" statement), which can be symbolically represented as \\( G \\lor I \\), where \\( G \\) represents \"Fido is in the garden\" and \\( I \\) represents \"Fido is inside.\"\n\n2. \"Fido is not in the garden.\" This is a negation of \\( G \\), symbolically represented as \\( \\neg G \\).\n\nFrom these two statements, we can apply the rule of disjunction elimination in logic. The rule states that if we have \\( A \\lor B \\) (either \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) is true) and we know \\( \\neg A \\) (A is not true), then \\( B \\) must be true.\n\nApplying this to our case:\n- From statement 1, we have \\( G \\lor I \\) (Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside).\n- From statement 2, we have \\( \\neg G \\) (Fido is not in the garden).\n\nSince \\( G \\lor I \\) and \\( \\neg G \\) are both true, by disjunction elimination, \\( I \\) (Fido is inside) must be true.\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside\" and \"Fido is not in the garden,\" we can indeed infer that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
