It states that one of two conditions must be true: either the book is on the table, or the book is on the shelf.\n\nThe second statement provides a specific condition: the book is not on the table.\n\nGiven that the first statement tells us it must be one condition or the other, and the second statement eliminates the possibility of the book being on the table, the only remaining possibility from the original disjunction is that the book must be on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, from these premises, we can infer that the book is indeed on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
