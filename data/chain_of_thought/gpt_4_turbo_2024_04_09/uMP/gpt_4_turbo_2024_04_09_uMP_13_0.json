            "content": "The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" establishes a conditional relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck. This can be represented as: If P (the car was red), then Q (the truck was blue).\n\nThe additional information provided is that the car was indeed red. This corresponds to the condition P being true.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if a conditional statement (If P then Q) is true and the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, since it is given that \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and \"the car was red,\" we can logically conclude that \"the truck was blue.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
