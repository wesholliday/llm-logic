Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nFrom statement 1, we have a conditional statement: If P (Lisa bought the red shirt), then Q (Mark bought the blue shirt). This is expressed as P \u2192 Q.\n\nStatement 2 confirms that P is true (Lisa bought the red shirt).\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if P \u2192 Q is true and P is true, then Q must also be true.\n\nTherefore, since both the conditional statement and the premise (Lisa bought the red shirt) are true, we can conclude that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
