This is a straightforward \"if-then\" logical statement.\n\nThe second statement confirms that the condition of the first statement (\"the dog was inside\") is true.\n\nGiven that the condition of the first statement is met, the conclusion of that statement (\"the cat was outside\") must also be true according to the rules of logic.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cat was outside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
