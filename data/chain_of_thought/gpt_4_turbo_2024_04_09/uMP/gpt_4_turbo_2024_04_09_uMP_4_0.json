The alien visited Mars.\n\nFrom statement 1, we have a conditional statement: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\" This can be expressed in logical terms as: If A, then B.\n\nStatement 2 confirms that A (the alien visited Mars) is true.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if 'If A, then B' is true and A is true, then B must also be true.\n\nTherefore, since the alien did visit Mars, it logically follows that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
