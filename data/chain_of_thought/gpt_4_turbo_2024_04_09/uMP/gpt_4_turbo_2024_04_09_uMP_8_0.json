This is expressed as P \u2192 Q.\n\nThe second statement tells us that P is true (the vampire was awake).\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if P \u2192 Q is true and P is true, then Q must also be true.\n\nTherefore, since the vampire was awake (P is true), and if the vampire was awake then the mummy was awake (P \u2192 Q is true), we can conclude that the mummy was awake (Q is true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
