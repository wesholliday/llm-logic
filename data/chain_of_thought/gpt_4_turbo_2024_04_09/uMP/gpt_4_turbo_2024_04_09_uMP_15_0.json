            "content": "The problem presents two statements:\n1. If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n2. Sam took a plane.\n\nFrom these statements, we can use the form of logical reasoning known as modus ponens. Modus ponens is a rule in logic that states if \"P implies Q\" (if P then Q) and \"P is true,\" then \"Q must also be true.\"\n\nApplying this to the given statements:\n- \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" can be represented as P implies Q.\n- \"Sam took a plane\" asserts that P is true.\n\nSince both the condition (P) and the implication (P implies Q) are given as true, we can conclude that Q, which is \"Erin took a train,\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
