Alex finished the race.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know there is a conditional relationship where Chris finishing the race is dependent on Alex finishing the race. Statement 2 confirms that Alex did finish the race.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if we have a conditional statement (\"If P then Q\") and the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nHere, P is \"Alex finished the race\" and Q is \"Chris finished the race.\" Since P is true (Alex finished the race), Q must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Chris finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
