Tom watched football.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know there is a conditional relationship where Jen watching basketball is dependent on Tom watching football. Statement 2 confirms that Tom did watch football.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if a conditional statement (\"if p then q\") is true and the antecedent (p) is true, then the consequent (q) must also be true.\n\nHere, \"p\" is Tom watching football and \"q\" is Jen watching basketball. Since both the conditional statement is given as true and the antecedent is confirmed as true, the consequent (Jen watched basketball) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
