This can be represented as: If P (Sue chose pizza), then Q (Bob chose pasta).\n\nThe additional information provided is that Sue chose pizza (P is true).\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if a conditional statement (If P then Q) is true and its antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, since it is given that \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" and \"Sue chose pizza,\" we can logically conclude that \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
