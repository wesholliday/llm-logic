The second statement confirms that \"Joe went to the park.\" According to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if a conditional statement (if P then Q) is true and the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true. Therefore, since Joe did go to the park, Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: yes",
