Jeff played basketball.\n\nFrom the first statement, we understand that Jeff playing basketball is a condition that guarantees Amy played tennis. This is a conditional statement where Jeff playing basketball is the sufficient condition for Amy playing tennis.\n\nThe second statement confirms that the sufficient condition (Jeff playing basketball) is true.\n\nGiven that the sufficient condition is met, we can logically conclude that the necessary condition (Amy playing tennis) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the logical relationship established by the conditional statement, we can infer that Amy played tennis.\n\nAnswer: yes",
