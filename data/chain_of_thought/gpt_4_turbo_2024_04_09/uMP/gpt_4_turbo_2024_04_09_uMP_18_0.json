This is a standard \"if-then\" logical structure.\n\nStatement 2 confirms that A is true (the doll was indeed plastic).\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if we have a statement of the form \"If A, then B\" and A is true, then B must also be true.\n\nTherefore, since the doll was plastic, it follows from the first statement that the truck must be metal.\n\nAnswer: yes",
