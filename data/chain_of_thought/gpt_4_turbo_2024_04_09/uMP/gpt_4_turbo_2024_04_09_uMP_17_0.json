Ben ate pasta.\n\nFrom statement 1, we understand that Kate eating salad is a direct consequence of Ben eating pasta. This is a conditional statement where Ben eating pasta is the condition that leads to Kate eating salad.\n\nStatement 2 confirms that the condition (Ben ate pasta) is true.\n\nSince the condition is true, the consequence (Kate ate salad) must also be true according to the logic of the conditional statement provided in statement 1.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Kate ate salad.\n\nAnswer: yes",
