It is also stated that \"Mary was at the wedding.\" According to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if a conditional statement (\"If P then Q\") is true and the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true. Here, P represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\" Since both the conditional statement is true and its antecedent is true, the consequent must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
