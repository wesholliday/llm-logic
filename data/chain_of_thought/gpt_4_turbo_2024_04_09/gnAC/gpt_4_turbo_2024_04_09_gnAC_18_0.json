            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given:\n\n1. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" (If P then Q)\n2. \"The truck was metal\" (Q)\n\nWe are asked if it necessarily follows that \"The doll was plastic\" (P).\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the first part (the doll was plastic) is true, then the second part (the truck was metal) must also be true. However, it does not tell us that the truck being metal is only true if the doll was plastic. The truck being metal could be true for reasons other than the doll being plastic.\n\nThe second statement confirms that the truck was indeed metal. However, this does not provide information about the material of the doll. The truck being metal (Q) could be true whether the doll was plastic (P) or not.\n\nIn logical terms, knowing Q (the truck was metal) is true does not allow us to definitively conclude P (the doll was plastic) because the original conditional statement does not specify that the truck being metal can only happen if the doll is plastic. This is a classic example of the logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\"\n\nTherefore, from the information given, we cannot conclude that the doll was necessarily plastic just because the truck was metal.\n\nAnswer: no",
