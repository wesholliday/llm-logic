            "content": "To determine if \"Mary was at the wedding\" necessarily follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical implications:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be represented as: If M, then S.\n\n2. The second statement is a simple declaration: \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be represented as: S is true.\n\nFrom these, we need to determine if M (Mary was at the wedding) must also be true.\n\nThe conditional statement \"If M, then S\" tells us that whenever Mary is at the wedding, Sue must also be at the wedding. However, it does not state that if Sue is at the wedding, Mary must also be there. The truth of S (Sue was at the wedding) does not necessarily imply the truth of M (Mary was at the wedding) because the original conditional does not specify what happens if Sue is at the wedding without Mary.\n\nTherefore, even though Sue was at the wedding, this does not provide sufficient information to conclude definitively that Mary was also at the wedding. Mary could be there, or she might not be; the statements given do not lock in her presence.\n\nAnswer: no",
