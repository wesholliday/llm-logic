The statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" can be represented as: If A, then C.\n2. We know that \"Chris finished the race\" is true, which means C is true.\n\nFrom the information given:\n- If A (Alex finished the race), then C (Chris finished the race) is true.\n- C (Chris finished the race) is true.\n\nHowever, knowing that C is true does not provide direct information about A (whether Alex finished the race). The statement \"If A, then C\" does not imply \"If C, then A\" unless explicitly stated or proven, which is not the case here. The truth of C alone does not determine the truth of A because the implication does not work backwards inherently.\n\nTherefore, from the information given, we cannot conclude that Alex finished the race based solely on the truth that Chris finished the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
