            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given:\n\n1. \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" - This is a conditional statement where Jeff playing basketball is a sufficient condition for Amy playing tennis.\n2. \"Amy played tennis\" - This is a statement of fact.\n\nThe question asks whether from these two statements, it necessarily follows that \"Jeff played basketball\" is true.\n\nThe conditional statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" can be symbolically represented as \\( J \\rightarrow A \\), where \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) represents \"Amy played tennis\".\n\nThe fact that \"Amy played tennis\" is true does not necessarily imply that \"Jeff played basketball\" is true. The conditional \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) only tells us that if \\( J \\) is true, then \\( A \\) must be true. However, \\( A \\) being true does not necessarily mean \\( J \\) must be true; \\( A \\) could be true whether or not \\( J \\) is true.\n\nThis is because a conditional statement does not specify what happens when the antecedent (in this case, Jeff playing basketball) is false. Amy playing tennis could be due to other reasons unrelated to whether Jeff played basketball.\n\nTherefore, from the truth of \"Amy played tennis,\" we cannot conclude that \"Jeff played basketball\" must also be true. This is a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent.\n\nAnswer: no",
