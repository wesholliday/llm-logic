            "content": "Explanation: The original statement, \"The contract must have been approved by the legal team or the CEO,\" implies that for the contract to be valid, it requires approval from either the legal team or the CEO. This statement sets up a condition where the approval of the contract is contingent upon the endorsement from at least one of these two parties.\n\nWhen breaking down the statement into \"The contract must have been approved by the legal team or it must have been approved by the CEO,\" we are essentially restating the original condition in a slightly more explicit form. This restatement maintains the logical structure of the original statement by specifying that the necessity of approval (indicated by \"must have been approved\") applies individually to both the legal team and the CEO as alternative options. \n\nThus, the inference maintains the integrity of the original meaning by clarifying that the requirement of approval applies separately to each party mentioned, still fulfilling the condition of needing approval from at least one of the two sources mentioned. Therefore, the inference is a valid one based on the logical equivalence between the original statement and the inferred statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
