Analyze the second statement: \"Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered.\" This is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the conditions must be true.\n\n3. Combine the two statements:\n   - From the first statement, we know \"The fleeg is not surned.\"\n   - Given the disjunction in the second statement, if \"The fleeg is not surned\" is true, then the only other option available in the disjunction for the statement to hold true is \"The fleeg is bluttered.\"\n\n4. Conclusion: Since \"The fleeg is not surned\" is true, and the only way for the second statement to also be true is if \"The fleeg is bluttered,\" we can infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
