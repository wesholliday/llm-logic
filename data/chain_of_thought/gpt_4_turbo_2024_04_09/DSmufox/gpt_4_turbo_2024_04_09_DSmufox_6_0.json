            "content": "To solve this, let's analyze the statements given:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped.\"\n   This can be interpreted as the negation of the necessity of the grommet being plopped. Symbolically, this can be written as \u00ac\u25a1P (where P stands for \"the grommet is plopped\").\n\n2. \"Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed.\"\n   This is a logical disjunction, which can be symbolically represented as \u25a1P \u2228 S (where S stands for \"the grommet is sploffed\").\n\nGiven the first statement, \u00ac\u25a1P, we know that the proposition \u25a1P is false. Therefore, in the disjunction \u25a1P \u2228 S, since \u25a1P is false, S must be true for the disjunction to hold. Thus, the statement that \"the grommet is sploffed\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
