Analyze the second statement: \"Either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed.\" This can be rewritten as: Z \u2228 B (where B represents \"the flug is blummed\").\n\n3. Apply the information from the first statement to the second statement. Since we know \u00acZ (the flug must not be zimmed), we can use the logical rule of disjunction elimination on Z \u2228 B. If Z is false (\u00acZ), then B must be true to satisfy the disjunction Z \u2228 B.\n\n4. Therefore, from \u00acZ and Z \u2228 B, we can infer B (the flug is blummed).\n\nAnswer: yes",
