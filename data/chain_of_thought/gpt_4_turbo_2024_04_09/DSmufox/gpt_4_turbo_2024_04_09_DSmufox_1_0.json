From the first statement, we know that \"The flugel must not be zargled\" is true. Therefore, the condition \"the flugel must be zargled\" in the second statement is false.\n\nStep 4: Since in the disjunction \"Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed,\" the part \"the flugel must be zargled\" is false, the only way for the disjunction to hold true is if the other part \"it is blimmed\" is true.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, we can infer that \"The flugel is blimmed\" must be true to satisfy the disjunction given that \"the flugel must be zargled\" is false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
