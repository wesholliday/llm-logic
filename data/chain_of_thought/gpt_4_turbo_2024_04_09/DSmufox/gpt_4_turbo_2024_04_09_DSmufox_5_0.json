Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled.\n\nFrom statement 1, we understand that the zinger is not smoogled. This is a negation of the possibility that the zinger must be smoogled.\n\nStatement 2 presents a disjunction: either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled. Since we know from statement 1 that the zinger is not smoogled, the only remaining possibility in the disjunction (to maintain the truth of statement 2) is that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nThus, given that the zinger is not smoogled, and the only other option provided is that it is fraggled, we can infer that the zinger is indeed fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
