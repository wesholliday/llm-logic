Therefore, \"the clug must be snugged\" (S) is false.\n\nGiven the second statement (S \u2228 F) and knowing that S is false, the only way for the statement S \u2228 F to be true (which it must be) is if F (\"the clug is fleeked\") is true.\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The clug is fleeked\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
