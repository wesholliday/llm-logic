Therefore, \u00ac(wug must be bimmed) is true.\n\nGiven the second statement, since we know that the first part of the disjunction (wug must be bimmed) is false (from statement 1), the only way for the disjunction to hold true is if the second part (wug is flooped) is true.\n\nTherefore, from these two statements, we can infer that the wug is indeed flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
