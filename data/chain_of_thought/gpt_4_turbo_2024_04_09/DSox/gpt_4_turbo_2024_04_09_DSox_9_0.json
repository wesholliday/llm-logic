Consider the second statement: \"Either the twonk is varnished or it is plinked.\" This is a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) stating that one of the two conditions must be true for the twonk.\n\n3. Since we know from the first statement that the twonk is not plinked, the only remaining possibility from the disjunction in the second statement is that the twonk must be varnished.\n\n4. Therefore, given that the twonk cannot be plinked, and the only alternative provided is that it is either plinked or varnished, we can infer that the twonk must be varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
