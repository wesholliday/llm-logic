Since we know from statement 1 that \"the fribble is crinked\" is false, the only remaining possibility for statement 2 to hold true is that \"the fribble is snurgled\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, given the truth of statement 1 and the structure of statement 2, we can infer that \"The fribble is snurgled\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
