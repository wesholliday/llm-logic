The conditions are:\n- The zinger is fraggled.\n- The zinger is smoogled.\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that \"The zinger is not smoogled\" is true, the only remaining possibility from the disjunction in statement 2 for the statement to hold true is \"The zinger is fraggled.\"\n\nTherefore, given that \"The zinger is not smoogled\" and \"Either the zinger is fraggled or it is smoogled,\" we can infer that \"The zinger is fraggled\" must be true to satisfy the conditions of the statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
