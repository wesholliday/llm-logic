Since we know from statement 1 that the splat is not quanked, the only remaining possibility within the disjunction of statement 2 is that the splat is morphed.\n\nTherefore, given that the splat is not quanked, and the only other option provided is that it is morphed, we can infer that the splat must be morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
