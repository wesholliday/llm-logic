The conditions are:\n- The wug is sproinged.\n- The wug is garpled.\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that \"The wug is garpled\" is false, the only remaining possibility for statement 2 to hold true is that \"The wug is sproinged\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, given the truth of statement 1 and the structure of statement 2, we can infer that \"The wug is sproinged\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
