The conditions are:\n- The glip is slogged.\n- The glip is tragged.\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that \"The glip is tragged\" is false, the only remaining possibility for statement 2 to hold true is that \"The glip is slogged\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, given the truth of statement 1 and the structure of statement 2, we can infer that \"The glip is slogged\" is indeed true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
