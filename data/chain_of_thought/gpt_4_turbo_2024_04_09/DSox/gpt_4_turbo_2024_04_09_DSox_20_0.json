Consider the second statement: \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned.\" This is a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) stating that one of the two conditions must be true for the fleeg.\n\n3. Since we know from the first statement that \"The fleeg is not surned,\" the condition of being \"surned\" is false.\n\n4. Given the structure of the disjunction in the second statement, if one part of the disjunction is false (\"the fleeg is surned\"), the other part must be true to satisfy the statement as a whole.\n\n5. Therefore, since \"the fleeg is not surned\" is true, the only remaining possibility that satisfies the second statement is \"the fleeg is bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
