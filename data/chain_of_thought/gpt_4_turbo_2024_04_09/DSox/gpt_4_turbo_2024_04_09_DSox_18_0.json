The conditions are:\n- The shank is plooked.\n- The shank is nugged.\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that \"The shank is not nugged\" is true, the only remaining possibility from the disjunction in statement 2 is that \"The shank is plooked\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, given the truth of the first statement and the structure of the second statement, we can infer that \"The shank is plooked\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
