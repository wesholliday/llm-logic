The conditions are:\n- The sprocket is cranked.\n- The sprocket is daggled.\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that \"The sprocket is not daggled\" is true, the only remaining possibility for statement 2 to hold true is \"The sprocket is cranked.\"\n\nTherefore, given that \"The sprocket is not daggled\" and \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it is daggled,\" we can infer that \"The sprocket is cranked\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
