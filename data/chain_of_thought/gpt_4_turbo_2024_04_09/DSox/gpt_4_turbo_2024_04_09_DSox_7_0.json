Consider the second statement: \"Either the whiffle is shanked or it is tinked.\" This is a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" statement), which means that at least one of the conditions must be true.\n\n3. Since we know from the first statement that \"The whiffle is not tinked,\" the condition of being tinked is false.\n\n4. Given that the disjunction states that either the whiffle is shanked or tinked, and we know tinked is false, the only remaining possibility within the confines of the disjunction for the statement to hold true is that \"The whiffle is shanked.\"\n\n5. Therefore, from the information given, we can infer that \"The whiffle is shanked\" must be true to satisfy the logical conditions set by the statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
