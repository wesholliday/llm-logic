Since we know from statement 1 that \"the wug is bimmed\" is false, the only remaining possibility for statement 2 to hold true is for \"the wug is flooped\" to be true.\n\nTherefore, given that \"the wug is not bimmed\" and \"Either the wug is flooped or it is bimmed,\" we can logically infer that \"the wug is flooped\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
