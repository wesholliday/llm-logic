Since we know from statement 1 that the flob is not movated, the only remaining possibility from the disjunction in statement 2 is that the flob must be skizzled.\n\nTherefore, given that the flob is not movated, and the only other option provided is that it is skizzled, we can infer that the flob is indeed skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
