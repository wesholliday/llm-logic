Since we know from statement 1 that \"the flug is zimmed\" is false, the only remaining possibility for statement 2 to hold true is that \"the flug is blummed\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, given that \"the flug is not zimmed\" and \"either the flug is blummed or it is zimmed,\" we can indeed infer that \"the flug is blummed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
