The conditions are:\n- The sneg is crampled.\n- The sneg is sproted.\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that \"The sneg is not sproted\" is true, the condition that \"The sneg is sproted\" in statement 2 must be false. \n\nGiven that in a disjunction (either/or statement) if one part is false, the other must be true to satisfy the statement, the only remaining possibility is that \"The sneg is crampled\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, from the information given, we can infer that \"The sneg is crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
