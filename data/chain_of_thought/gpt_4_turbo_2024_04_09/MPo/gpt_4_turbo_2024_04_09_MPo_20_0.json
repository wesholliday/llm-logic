            "content": "To solve this, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given:\n\n1. \"The apple was red.\"\n2. \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n\nThe first statement is a straightforward declaration: the apple was red. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that the truth of the second part (\"the banana was yellow\") is dependent on the truth of the first part (\"the apple was red\").\n\nSince the first part of the conditional statement (\"the apple was red\") is given as true, the rule of modus ponens (a basic rule in logic) allows us to infer that the second part (\"the banana was yellow\") must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can logically infer that the banana was yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
