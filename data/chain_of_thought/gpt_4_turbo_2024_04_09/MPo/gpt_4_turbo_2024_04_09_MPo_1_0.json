            "content": "To solve this, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements:\n\n1. \"Mary was at the wedding\" - This is a straightforward statement asserting that Mary attended the wedding.\n\n2. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" - This is a conditional statement. It asserts that Sue's attendance at the wedding is contingent upon Mary's attendance.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can apply the rule of modus ponens, a basic principle in logic. Modus ponens states that if a conditional statement (\"if P then Q\") is true, and its antecedent (P) is true, then its consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nHere, the antecedent is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and the consequent is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" Since the statement \"Mary was at the wedding\" is given as true, and the conditional statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is also accepted as true, we can conclude that \"Sue was at the wedding\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
