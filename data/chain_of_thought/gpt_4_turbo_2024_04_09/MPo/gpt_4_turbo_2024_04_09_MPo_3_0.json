We also have a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nFrom these two statements, we can apply the rule of modus ponens in logic, which states that if \"p implies q\" (if p then q) and \"p\" is true, then \"q\" must also be true.\n\nHere, \"p\" is \"The book was written by James\" and \"q\" is \"The book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nSince we know \"p\" is true (the book was written by James), and \"p implies q\" (if the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel), we can conclude that \"q\" is true.\n\nTherefore, the book is a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: yes",
