            "content": "To solve this, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given:\n\n1. \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" - This is a straightforward statement of fact.\n2. \"If Lisa bought the red, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" - This is a conditional statement, where the buying of the red shirt by Lisa is a condition that leads to the conclusion that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nThe structure of the second statement is a classic \"if-then\" logical condition. In logical terms, it can be expressed as:\n- If P, then Q.\nWhere P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\".\n\nGiven that the first statement confirms that P (\"Lisa bought the red shirt\") is true, the rule of modus ponens (a fundamental rule in logic) allows us to infer that Q (\"Mark bought the blue shirt\") must also be true, because the truth of P necessarily leads to the truth of Q according to the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the information and logical deduction:\n\nAnswer: yes",
