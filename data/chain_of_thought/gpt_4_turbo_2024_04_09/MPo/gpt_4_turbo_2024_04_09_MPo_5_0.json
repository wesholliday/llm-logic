The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that the occurrence of the first event (Jeff playing basketball) guarantees the occurrence of the second event (Amy playing tennis).\n\nSince the first statement confirms that Jeff did indeed play basketball, and the second statement establishes that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis, we can logically conclude that Amy played tennis based on these premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
