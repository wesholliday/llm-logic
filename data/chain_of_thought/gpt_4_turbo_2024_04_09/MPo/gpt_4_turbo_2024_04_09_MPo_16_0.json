            "content": "To solve this, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given:\n\n1. \"The shirt was cotton.\"\n2. \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\n\nThe first statement is a straightforward declaration: the shirt is made of cotton. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means it sets a condition that if the first part (the antecedent) is true, then the second part (the consequent) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent is \"the shirt was cotton.\" According to the first statement, this is true. The conditional statement then tells us that if this antecedent is true, the consequent (\"the pants were denim\") must also be true.\n\nSince the antecedent is indeed true, we can logically conclude that the consequent must also be true based on the conditional statement provided.\n\nAnswer: yes",
