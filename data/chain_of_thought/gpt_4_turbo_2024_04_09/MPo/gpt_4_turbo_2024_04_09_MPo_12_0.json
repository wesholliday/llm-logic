If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nThe first statement is a straightforward declaration: Joe went to the park.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If P, then Q. Here, P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nGiven that the first statement (P) is true, and the second statement establishes that if P is true, then Q must also be true, we can conclude that Q (\"Lucy went to the zoo\") must indeed be true based on the truth of P and the conditional relationship stated.\n\nAnswer: yes",
