The second statement is a conditional: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This can be expressed in logical form as: If P, then Q.\n\nGiven that P (Sam took a plane) is true, and the conditional statement (If P, then Q) is also provided as true, we can infer Q (Erin took a train) based on the rule of modus ponens in logic. Modus ponens states that if a conditional statement (If P, then Q) is true, and P is true, then Q must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the statements provided, we can logically infer that Erin took a train.\n\nAnswer: yes",
