            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements provided.\n\n1. The first statement is a fact: \"The doll was plastic.\"\n2. The second statement is a conditional: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n\nThe structure of the second statement is an \"if-then\" logical conditional, where the \"if\" part (antecedent) is \"the doll was plastic\" and the \"then\" part (consequent) is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if the antecedent of a conditional statement is true, then the consequent must also be true. Here, since the antecedent (\"the doll was plastic\") is given as true, we can logically conclude that the consequent (\"the truck was metal\") must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the information and the application of modus ponens, we can infer that the truck was metal.\n\nAnswer: yes",
