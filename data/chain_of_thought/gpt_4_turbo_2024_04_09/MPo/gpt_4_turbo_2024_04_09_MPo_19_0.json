            "content": "To solve this, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements:\n\n1. \"Tom watched football.\"\n2. \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThe first statement is a straightforward declaration that Tom watched football. The second statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the first part (the condition) is true, then the second part (the consequence) must also be true.\n\nSince the first statement confirms that Tom did watch football, we can apply the conditional statement. According to the conditional statement, if Tom watched football (which he did), then Jen watched basketball.\n\nTherefore, based on the truth of the first statement and the condition set by the second statement, we can infer that Jen watched basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
