            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given:\n\n1. \"The vampire was awake.\"\n2. \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n\nThe first statement is a straightforward declaration: the vampire was awake.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical form as: If P, then Q. Here, P is \"the vampire was awake\" and Q is \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\nGiven that the first statement affirms that P is true (\"The vampire was awake\"), and the second statement establishes that if P is true, then Q must also be true (\"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\"), we can logically conclude that Q (\"The mummy was awake\") must be true.\n\nThis type of reasoning follows the modus ponens rule in logic, where if \"P implies Q\" is true and \"P\" is true, then \"Q\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
