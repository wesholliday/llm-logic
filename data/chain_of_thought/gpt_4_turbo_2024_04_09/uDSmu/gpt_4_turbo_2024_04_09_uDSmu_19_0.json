It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\n\nFrom the first statement, we have two possibilities: the watch is either charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist. The second statement negates the possibility that the watch must be on his wrist. Therefore, the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
