It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nFrom the first statement, we have a logical disjunction (an \"or\" statement): Fido is either inside or in the garden. The second statement negates the possibility that Fido must be in the garden. This negation implies that the only remaining possibility from the disjunction is that Fido is inside.\n\nSince the option of Fido being in the garden is negated, and the only other option provided by the disjunction is that Fido is inside, we can infer that Fido must indeed be inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
