It is also stated that it is not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head. This statement eliminates the possibility of the sunglasses being on her head as a necessity. Given that these are the only two options provided, and one option (on her head) is negated, the only remaining possibility is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
