It is also stated that it is not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door. This statement eliminates the possibility of the shoes being lined up by the door.\n\nGiven that the only other option presented is that the shoes are in the closet, and since the possibility of them being by the door is negated, the only remaining logical conclusion is that the shoes must be in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
