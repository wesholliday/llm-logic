It is also stated that it is not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch. This statement implies that the possibility of the remote control being under the couch is not a necessity.\n\nGiven that the remote control being under the couch is not a necessity, and the only other presented option is that the remote control is on the coffee table, we can infer that the remote control must be on the coffee table. This is because the statement logically eliminates the necessity of the other option (under the couch), leaving the coffee table as the only remaining possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
