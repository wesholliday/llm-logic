It is also stated that it is not the case that the sock must be under the bed. This implies that the possibility of the sock being under the bed is negated.\n\nGiven that the sock being under the bed is negated and the only other option presented is that the sock is in the laundry basket, we are left with the conclusion that the sock must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
