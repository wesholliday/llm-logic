It is also stated that it is not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom. This implies that the possibility of the cat playing in the bedroom is not true. Given that one of the two initial possibilities must be true and the option of the cat playing in the bedroom is ruled out, the only remaining possibility is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
