It is stated as a logical disjunction (either/or scenario). \n\nThe statement also includes a negation: it is not the case that the book must be resting on the table. This negation implies that the possibility of the book being on the table is not true.\n\nGiven that the book cannot be on the table, and the only other presented option is that the book is on the shelf, we are left with the conclusion that the book must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
