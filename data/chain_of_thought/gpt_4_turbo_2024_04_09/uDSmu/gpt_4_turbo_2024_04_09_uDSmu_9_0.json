It is also stated that it is not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor. This implies that the possibility of the puzzle piece blending in on the floor is not true.\n\nGiven that the two initial possibilities are that the puzzle piece is either in the box or blending in on the floor, and the second possibility (blending in on the floor) is negated, the only remaining possibility is that the puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
