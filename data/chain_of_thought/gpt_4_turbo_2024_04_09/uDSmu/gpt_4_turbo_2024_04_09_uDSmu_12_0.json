It is also stated that it is not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet. This statement implies that the possibility of the jacket hanging in the closet is not true. Therefore, the only remaining possibility from the initial options provided is that the jacket is draped over the chair. Since the other option (hanging in the closet) has been negated, the jacket must be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
