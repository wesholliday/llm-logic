It is stated as a logical disjunction (either/or scenario). Additionally, it is stated that it is not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry. This negation eliminates the possibility of the cookies being in the pantry.\n\nGiven that the only two possibilities were that the cookies were either in the jar or in the pantry, and the option of the pantry is negated, the only remaining possibility is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
