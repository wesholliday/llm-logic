It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch.\n\nFrom the first premise, we have a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario): the newspaper is either in the driveway or on the porch. The second premise negates the possibility that the newspaper must be on the porch. This negation implies that the only remaining possibility from the disjunction is that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nSince the option of the newspaper being on the porch is ruled out by the second premise, the only remaining valid conclusion under the given conditions is that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes",
