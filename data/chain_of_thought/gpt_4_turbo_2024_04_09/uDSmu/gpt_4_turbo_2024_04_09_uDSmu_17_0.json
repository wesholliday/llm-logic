It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\n\nFrom statement 1, we have two possibilities:\n- The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n- The scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the second possibility (the scarf must be draped on the coat rack) is not true.\n\nSince the second possibility is false and the initial statement was an \"either/or\" condition, the only remaining possibility is that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
