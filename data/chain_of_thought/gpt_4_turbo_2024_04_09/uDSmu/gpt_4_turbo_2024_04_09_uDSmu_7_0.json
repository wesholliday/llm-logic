It is also stated that it is not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet. This statement effectively eliminates the possibility that the umbrella is in the closet.\n\nGiven that the only two possibilities were that the umbrella is either in the car or in the closet, and the option of the closet has been negated, the only remaining possibility is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
