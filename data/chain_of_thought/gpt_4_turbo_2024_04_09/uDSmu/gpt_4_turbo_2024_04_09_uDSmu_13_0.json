It also states that it is not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf. This implies that the possibility of the toy being on the bookshelf is not a necessity. Given that these are the only two presented options and the bookshelf option is negated as a necessity, the only remaining possibility under these conditions is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
