Just because a statement is true, it does not mean that its inverse is also true. The original statement does not provide information about books not written by James, except that if a book is not a mystery novel, it was not written by James. It does not imply that all books not written by James are not mystery novels; there could be other authors who also write mystery novels.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical analysis, we cannot infer that if the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: no",
