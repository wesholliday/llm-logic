            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the given statement and its contrapositive.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" In logical terms, this can be written as:\n\\[ P \\implies Q \\]\nwhere \\( P \\) is \"the car was red\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\implies Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\implies \\neg P \\), which is logically equivalent to the original statement. For this scenario, the contrapositive would be:\n\\[ \\text{If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.} \\]\nThis can be written as:\n\\[ \\neg Q \\implies \\neg P \\]\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we need to evaluate: \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\" This statement can be written as:\n\\[ \\neg P \\implies \\neg Q \\]\n\nIt's important to note that \\( \\neg P \\implies \\neg Q \\) is not the contrapositive of the original statement \\( P \\implies Q \\); rather, it is the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that \\( \\neg P \\implies \\neg Q \\) is true based solely on the truth of \\( P \\implies Q \\).\n\nThus, from the statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
