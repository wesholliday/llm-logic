The converse of a statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot logically infer that \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake\" from the original statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
