            "content": "To solve this, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statement and its contrapositive.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" In logical form, this can be written as:\n\\[ P \\implies Q \\]\nwhere \\( P \\) is \"the shirt was cotton\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\implies Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\implies \\neg P \\), which in this context translates to \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\" This is logically equivalent to the original statement and is always true if the original statement is true.\n\nHowever, the question asks if we can infer \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim,\" which is the inverse of the original statement and is represented as:\n\\[ \\neg P \\implies \\neg Q \\]\n\nThe inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Just because the original statement \\( P \\implies Q \\) is true does not necessarily mean that \\( \\neg P \\implies \\neg Q \\) is true. The truth of the inverse depends on additional information which is not provided by the original statement alone.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given and the rules of logic:\n\nAnswer: no",
