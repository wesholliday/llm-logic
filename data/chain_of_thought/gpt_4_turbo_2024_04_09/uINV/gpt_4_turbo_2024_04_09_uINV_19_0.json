The original statement only specifies what happens if P is true. It does not specify what happens if P is false. Jen might still watch basketball for reasons unrelated to whether Tom watches football or not.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
