    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",

            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements provided and their implications.\n\n1. **Understanding the given information:**\n   - Coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers.\n   - Tea is the second most likely to retain morning drinkers, followed by soda.\n   - If tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\n2. **Analyzing the implications:**\n   - Since coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers, the scenario where coffee does not retain the most morning drinkers is less likely.\n   - However, the statement provided says that if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers (which is likely since coffee is more likely to retain the most), then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\n3. **Considering the conditional structure:**\n   - The statement \"if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers\" sets up a conditional relationship where the truth of the latter part (soda retaining the most morning drinkers) is dependent on the truth of the former parts (tea and coffee not retaining the most morning drinkers).\n   - Given that tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers (since coffee is more likely), the first condition (tea doesn\u2019t retain the most) is likely true.\n\n4. **Evaluating the final condition:**\n   - The final part of the statement to evaluate is: if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n   - Since the condition about tea not retaining the most is likely true, and the statement provided establishes that if this is the case, then the scenario where coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most leads to soda retaining the most, it follows logically that if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, it is likely that soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure and the likelihoods provided in the scenario, it does follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nAnswer: yes",
