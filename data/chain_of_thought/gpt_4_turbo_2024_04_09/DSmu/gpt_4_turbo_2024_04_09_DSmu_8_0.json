            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given and apply logical reasoning.\n\n1. The first statement is a disjunction (an \"or\" statement): \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\" This can be represented as: A or B, where A = \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" and B = \"The remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\n2. The second statement is a negation: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\" This can be represented as: not B.\n\n3. Applying the logical rule of disjunction elimination, if we have A or B, and we know not B, then A must be true. This is because in a disjunction, if one of the components is false, the truth of the disjunction relies on the other component being true.\n\nGiven that we know not B (the remote control is not hiding under the couch), and the original statement was A or B (it's either on the coffee table or under the couch), the only remaining possibility that satisfies the original statement is A (the remote control is on the coffee table).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
