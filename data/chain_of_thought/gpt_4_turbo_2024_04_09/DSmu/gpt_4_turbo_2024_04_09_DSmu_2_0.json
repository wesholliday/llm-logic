It states that there are two possibilities:\n- The book is on the shelf.\n- The book must be resting on the table.\n\nThe second statement negates the second part of the disjunction. It states that it is not true that the book must be resting on the table.\n\nGiven that the second part of the disjunction (the book must be resting on the table) is negated by the second statement, the only remaining possibility from the disjunction is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical analysis of these statements, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
