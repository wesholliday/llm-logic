It states that there are two possibilities:\n- The pen is in my bag.\n- The pen must be on my desk.\n\nThe second statement negates the necessity of the second option in the disjunction. It tells us that it is not necessarily true that the pen is on the desk.\n\nGiven that the second option (\"the pen must be on my desk\") is negated by the second statement, the only remaining possibility from the original disjunction is that the pen is in the bag. Therefore, we can conclude that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
