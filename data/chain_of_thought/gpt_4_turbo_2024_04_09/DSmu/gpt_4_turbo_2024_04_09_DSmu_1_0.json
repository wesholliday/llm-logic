            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given:\n\n1. \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\"\n2. \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\nThe first statement is a logical disjunction (an \"or\" statement). It states that one of the following two conditions must be true:\n- Fido is inside.\n- Fido must be in the garden.\n\nThe second statement is a negation. It negates the second part of the disjunction:\n- It is not true that Fido must be in the garden.\n\nGiven that the disjunction (the first statement) must be true, and one part of the disjunction (Fido must be in the garden) is negated by the second statement, the only remaining possibility for the disjunction to hold true is the other part of the disjunction. Therefore, the statement \"Fido is inside\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
