The contraposition of the first statement is: If \u00acP (not P), then \u00acV (not V). This means if the smonk did not plag, then the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nSince the second statement confirms \u00acP (not P), we can use modus ponens with the contrapositive of the first statement:\n- If \u00acP, then \u00acV (from contraposition)\n- \u00acP (given)\n- Therefore, \u00acV (the smonk was not vreebled).\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can infer that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
