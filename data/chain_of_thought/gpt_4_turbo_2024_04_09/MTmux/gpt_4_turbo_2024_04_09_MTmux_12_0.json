(S \u2192 L)\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint.\"\n   This can be represented as: Not L. (\u00acL)\n\nWe are asked to determine if we can infer from these statements that \"The smip was not shripped.\" This would be represented as Not S (\u00acS).\n\nUsing the rules of logic, particularly modus tollens, we can analyze the statements:\n- Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P then Q) and the negation of the consequent (Not Q), then we can infer the negation of the antecedent (Not P).\n- Applying modus tollens to our case:\n  - If S (the smip was shripped) then L (the smip must have lupped the zoint) [S \u2192 L]\n  - Not L (It's not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint) [\u00acL]\n  - Therefore, Not S (The smip was not shripped) [\u00acS]\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that the smip was not shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
