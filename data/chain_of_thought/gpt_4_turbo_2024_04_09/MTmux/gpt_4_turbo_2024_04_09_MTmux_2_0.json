(P \u2192 Q)\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the wug must have bimmed the zoint.\"\n   This can be represented as: Not Q. (\u00acQ)\n\nWe are asked to determine if from these two statements, we can infer:\n\"The wug was not flooped.\"\n   This can be represented as: Not P. (\u00acP)\n\nUsing the rules of logic, particularly modus tollens, we can analyze the statements:\n- Modus tollens states that if P implies Q (P \u2192 Q) and Q is not true (\u00acQ), then P is not true (\u00acP).\n\nApplying modus tollens to the given statements:\n- P \u2192 Q (If the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint)\n- \u00acQ (It's not the case that the wug must have bimmed the zoint)\n\nFrom these, we can conclude:\n- \u00acP (The wug was not flooped)\n\nThus, based on the logical inference rule of modus tollens, we can infer that \"The wug was not flooped\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
