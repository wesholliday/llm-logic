            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the statements given:\n\n1. \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled.\"\n   This can be represented as: If A (sprocket was cranked), then B (sprocket must have been daggled).\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled.\"\n   This can be represented as: Not B.\n\nFrom these statements, we can use the rule of contraposition on the first statement. The contraposition of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" Therefore, from \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled,\" we can infer \"If the sprocket must not have been daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nGiven the second statement, \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled\" (Not B), we can directly apply the contrapositive inference:\n\nSince Not B is true, then Not A must also be true, which means \"The sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
