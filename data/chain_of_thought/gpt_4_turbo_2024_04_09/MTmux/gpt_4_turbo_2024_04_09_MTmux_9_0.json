However, we are given \\( \\neg V \\) (the twonk was not varnished). According to the rules of logic, if \\( P \\rightarrow V \\) and \\( \\neg V \\) are both true, then \\( P \\) must be false to maintain logical consistency. This is because the only way \\( P \\rightarrow V \\) can be true when \\( V \\) is false is if \\( P \\) is also false.\n\nThus, from \\( P \\rightarrow V \\) and \\( \\neg V \\), we can infer \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
