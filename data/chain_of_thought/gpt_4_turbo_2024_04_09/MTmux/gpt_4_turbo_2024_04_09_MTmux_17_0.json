            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given:\n\n1. \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated.\"\n   This can be represented as: If S (the flob was skizzled), then M (the flob must have movated).\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the flob must have movated.\"\n   This can be represented as: Not M.\n\nFrom these statements, we can use the logical rule known as modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P then Q) and the negation of the consequent (Not Q), then we can infer the negation of the antecedent (Not P). \n\nApplying modus tollens to the statements:\n- If S then M (If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated)\n- Not M (It's not the case that the flob must have movated)\n\nWe can infer:\n- Not S (The flob was not skizzled)\n\nThus, based on the logical inference rule of modus tollens, we can conclude that the flob was not skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
