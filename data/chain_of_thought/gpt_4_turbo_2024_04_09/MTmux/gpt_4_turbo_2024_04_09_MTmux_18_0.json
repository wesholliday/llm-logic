However, we are given \\( \\neg N \\) (it is not the case that \\( N \\) is true).\n\nFrom \\( \\neg N \\) and \\( P \\rightarrow N \\), we can apply the rule of modus tollens, which states that if \\( P \\rightarrow N \\) and \\( \\neg N \\), then \\( \\neg P \\). This means that if \"the shank must have been nugged\" is not true, then \"the shank was not pooked\" must be true.\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The shank was not pooked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
