Modus tollens states that if we have \"If A, then B\" and \"Not B\", then we can conclude \"Not A\".\n\nApplying this to the statements:\n- A = The sneg was crampled\n- B = The sneg must have sproted the frink\n\nSince we have \"If A, then B\" (If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink) and \"Not B\" (It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink), we can conclude \"Not A\" (The sneg was not crampled).\n\nAnswer: yes",
