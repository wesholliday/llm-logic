The contrapositive of \"If B then S\" is \"If not S then not B.\" This means that if it is not the case that the fleeg must have been surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nGiven that the second statement confirms Not S, we can apply the contrapositive (If not S then not B) to conclude that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
