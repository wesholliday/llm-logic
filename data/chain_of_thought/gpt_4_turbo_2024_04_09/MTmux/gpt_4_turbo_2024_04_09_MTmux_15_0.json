The contrapositive of the first statement \"If V then S\" is \"If not S then not V\". This means if it is not true that the dreb must have been spened, then it is not true that the dreb was vroombed.\n\nGiven that the second statement confirms Not S, we can apply the contrapositive rule to infer Not V.\n\nTherefore, from the statements provided, we can infer that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
