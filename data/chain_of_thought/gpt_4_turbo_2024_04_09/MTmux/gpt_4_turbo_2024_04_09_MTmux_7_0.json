This statement can be represented as: Not P.\n\nFrom the logical structure:\n- If P (the whiffle was shanked), then Q (the whiffle must have tinked).\n- We know Not Q (the whiffle did not tinker).\n\nUsing the rule of contraposition in logic, which states that \"If P then Q\" is logically equivalent to \"If not Q then not P\", we can apply it here:\n- If Not Q (the whiffle did not tinker), then Not P (the whiffle was not shanked).\n\nGiven that we have established Not Q from the second premise, we can conclude Not P based on the contraposition of the first premise.\n\nTherefore, the inference \"The whiffle was not shanked\" is a valid conclusion from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
