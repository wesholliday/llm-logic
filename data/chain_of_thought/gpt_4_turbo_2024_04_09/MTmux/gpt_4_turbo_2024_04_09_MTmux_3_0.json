            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given and apply the rules of logical inference.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as:\n   \\( M \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( M \\) represents \"the splat was morphed\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"the splat must have quanked.\"\n\n2. The second statement is a negation: \"It's not the case that the splat must have quanked.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. We need to determine whether these premises allow us to infer that \"The splat was not morphed,\" which can be represented as \\( \\neg M \\).\n\n4. Using the rule of contraposition on the first statement, we can transform \\( M \\rightarrow Q \\) into \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg M \\). This rule states that a conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive.\n\n5. Given that we have \\( \\neg Q \\) from the second statement, and \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) from the contraposition of the first statement, we can apply modus ponens. Modus ponens is a rule of inference that states if \\( p \\rightarrow q \\) and \\( p \\) are both true, then \\( q \\) must also be true.\n\n6. Applying modus ponens with \\( \\neg Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg M \\), we conclude \\( \\neg M \\), which means \"The splat was not morphed.\"\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The splat was not morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
