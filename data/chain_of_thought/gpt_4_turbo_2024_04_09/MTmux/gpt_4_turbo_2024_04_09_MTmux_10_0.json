            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given and their implications.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as:\n   \\( S \\rightarrow G \\)\n   where \\( S \\) represents \"the wug was sproinged\" and \\( G \\) represents \"the wug must have been garpled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is a negation: \"It's not the case that the wug must have been garpled.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\( \\neg G \\)\n\n3. We need to determine whether these two statements together imply that \"The wug was not sproinged\" (\\( \\neg S \\)).\n\n4. Using the rules of logic, particularly modus tollens, we can analyze the implications. Modus tollens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) are both true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\n5. Applying modus tollens to our scenario:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( S \\rightarrow G \\)\n   - \\( \\neg Q \\) is \\( \\neg G \\)\n   - Therefore, \\( \\neg P \\) which is \\( \\neg S \\) must be true.\n\nThus, from the statements \"If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled\" and \"It's not the case that the wug must have been garpled,\" we can infer that \"The wug was not sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
