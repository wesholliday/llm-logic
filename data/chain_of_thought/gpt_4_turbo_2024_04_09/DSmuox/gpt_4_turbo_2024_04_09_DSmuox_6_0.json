So, \u00acP.\n\n2. \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped.\"\n   - This can be translated as: (grommet is sploffed) or (grommet must be plopped)\n   - Let's denote \"grommet is sploffed\" as S. So, S \u2228 P.\n\nGiven \u00acP (it is not the case that the grommet must be plopped), we can substitute this into the second statement:\n\n- S \u2228 P becomes S \u2228 \u00acP (since P is false).\n\nSince P is false, the only way for the statement S \u2228 P to be true is if S is true. Therefore, the grommet must be sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
