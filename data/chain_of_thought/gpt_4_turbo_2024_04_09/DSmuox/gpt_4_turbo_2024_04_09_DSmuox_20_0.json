Therefore, the part \"(fleeg must be surned)\" in statement 2 is false. \n\nGiven the structure of statement 2, which is an \"or\" statement (disjunction), if one part of the disjunction is false, the other part must be true for the entire statement to be true. Since \"(fleeg must be surned)\" is false, \"(fleeg is bluttered)\" must be true to satisfy the statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical deduction, we can infer that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
