So, S \u2228 M becomes S \u2228 \u00acM. Since \u00acM is true, the only way for the statement S \u2228 \u00acM to hold true is if S is true (because \u00acM does not affect the truth value of S in an OR operation).\n\nTherefore, from these premises, we can infer that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
