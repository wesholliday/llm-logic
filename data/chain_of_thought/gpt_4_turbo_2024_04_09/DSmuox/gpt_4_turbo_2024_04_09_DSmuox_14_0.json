Disjunctive syllogism states that if we have P \u2228 Q and \u00acP, then Q must be true.\n\nApplying this to our statements:\n- From F \u2228 S (Either the clug is fleeked or it must be snugged)\n- and \u00acS (It's not the case that the clug must be snugged),\n\nWe can conclude F (The clug is fleeked).\n\nAnswer: yes",
