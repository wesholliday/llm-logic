The first statement is \"It's not the case that the glip must be tragged.\" This can be rewritten in logical terms as:\n   \\(\\neg T\\) (where \\(T\\) stands for \"the glip must be tragged\").\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\(S \\vee T\\) (where \\(S\\) stands for \"the glip is slogged\").\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use logical deduction to analyze the situation:\n\n- From \\(\\neg T\\) (it is not the case that the glip must be tragged), we know that \\(T\\) is false.\n- Given \\(S \\vee T\\) (either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged), and knowing that \\(T\\) is false, the only way for the statement \\(S \\vee T\\) to be true is if \\(S\\) (the glip is slogged) is true.\n\nTherefore, from the statements provided, we can infer that \"The glip is slogged\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
