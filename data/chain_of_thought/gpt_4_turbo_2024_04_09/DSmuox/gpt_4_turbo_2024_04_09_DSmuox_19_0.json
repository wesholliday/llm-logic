The first statement is \"It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged.\" This can be rewritten in logical form as:\n   \\(\\neg P\\) (where \\(P\\) stands for \"the smonk must be plagged\").\n\n2. The second statement is \"Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\(V \\lor P\\) (where \\(V\\) stands for \"the smonk is vreebled\").\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use logical deduction to analyze the situation:\n\n- From \\(\\neg P\\) (it is not the case that the smonk must be plagged), we know that \\(P\\) is false.\n- Given \\(V \\lor P\\) (either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged), and knowing that \\(P\\) is false, the only way for the statement \\(V \\lor P\\) to be true is if \\(V\\) (the smonk is vreebled) is true.\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The smonk is vreebled\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
