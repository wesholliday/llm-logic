Therefore, in the expression P \u2228 N, since N is false, the truth of the entire expression P \u2228 N depends solely on P. \n\nGiven that the expression P \u2228 N must be true (as it is given as a premise), and knowing that N is false, P must be true for the expression P \u2228 N to hold. \n\nThus, from the premises provided, we can infer that \"The shank is plooked\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
