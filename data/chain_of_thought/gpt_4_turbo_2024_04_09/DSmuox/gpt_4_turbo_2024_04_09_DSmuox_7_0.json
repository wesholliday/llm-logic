Since it is established that \"The whiffle must not be tinked,\" the only remaining possibility from the disjunction is that \"The whiffle is shanked.\"\n\nStep 4: Since the only remaining valid option from the disjunction (given the negation of one of its components) is that \"The whiffle is shanked,\" we can infer that this must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
