Therefore, the part of statement 2 that says \"(sprocket must be daggled)\" is false. \n\nGiven that in a disjunction (an \"or\" statement), if one part is false, the truth of the disjunction depends on the truth of the other part. Since \"(sprocket must be daggled)\" is false, for the entire statement 2 to be true, \"(sprocket is cranked)\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
