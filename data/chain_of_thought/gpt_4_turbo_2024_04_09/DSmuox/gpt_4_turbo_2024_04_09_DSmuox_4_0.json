Analyze the first statement: \"It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked.\" This can be interpreted as the fribble does not necessarily have to be crinked, or simply, the fribble is not crinked.\n\n2. Analyze the second statement: \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked.\" This presents two possibilities - either the fribble is snurgled, or it must be crinked.\n\n3. Combine the analysis: Since the first statement negates the necessity of the fribble being crinked, and the second statement offers a disjunction where one option (the fribble must be crinked) is negated by the first statement, the only remaining valid option from the second statement is that the fribble is snurgled.\n\n4. Conclusion: Given that the necessity of the fribble being crinked is negated, and the only other option provided is that the fribble is snurgled, we can infer that the fribble is indeed snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
