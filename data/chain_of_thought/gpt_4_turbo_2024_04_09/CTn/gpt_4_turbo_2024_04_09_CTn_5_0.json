            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) where \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( \\neg A \\) represents \"Amy did not play tennis.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if the following statement is logically equivalent or can be inferred from the original statement: \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\" This can be written as: \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg J \\).\n\n3. To see if \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) can be inferred from \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg A \\), we need to understand the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) is \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg J \\), which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. Since the contrapositive of a statement is always true if the original statement is true, and because \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) is the contrapositive of \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg A \\), we can conclude that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
