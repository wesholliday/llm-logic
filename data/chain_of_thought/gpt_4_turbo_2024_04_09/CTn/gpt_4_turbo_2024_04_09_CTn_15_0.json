            "content": "To solve this, let's analyze the given statement and its logical implications:\n\n1. The statement given is: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\" In logical terms, this can be written as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg T \\), where \\( P \\) represents \"Sam took a plane\" and \\( T \\) represents \"Erin took a train\".\n\n2. The statement \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) implies that whenever \\( P \\) is true (\\( Sam took a plane \\)), \\( T \\) must be false (\\( Erin did not take a train \\)).\n\n3. We need to determine if this statement implies the converse: \"If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\" This can be written as \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\n4. To see if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) implies \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), consider the truth table for \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg T \\):\n   - If \\( P \\) is true and \\( T \\) is true, \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) is false (since \\( \\neg T \\) is false).\n   - If \\( P \\) is true and \\( T \\) is false, \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) is true.\n   - If \\( P \\) is false and \\( T \\) is true, \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) is true (since \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) is vacuously true when \\( P \\) is false).\n   - If \\( P \\) is false and \\( T \\) is false, \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) is true.\n\n5. Now, let's check the truth table for \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg P \\):\n   - If \\( T \\) is true and \\( P \\) is true, \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is false (since \\( \\neg P \\) is false).\n   - If \\( T \\) is true and \\( P \\) is false, \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is true.\n   - If \\( T \\) is false and \\( P \\) is true, \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is true (vacuously true when \\( T \\) is false).\n   - If \\( T \\) is false and \\( P \\) is false, \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is true.\n\n6. Comparing the truth tables, we see that the truth values of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) and \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) match in all cases. Therefore, the statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin did not take a train\" logically implies \"If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
