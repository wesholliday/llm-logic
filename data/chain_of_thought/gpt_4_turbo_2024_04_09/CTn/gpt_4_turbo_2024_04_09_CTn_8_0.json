            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements given:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was not awake.\n2. If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake.\n\nThe first statement can be written in logical form as:\nVampire awake \u2192 Mummy not awake.\n\nWe need to determine if this logically implies:\nMummy awake \u2192 Vampire not awake.\n\nUsing logical reasoning, if the vampire being awake implies that the mummy is not awake, then whenever the mummy is awake, the vampire cannot be awake. This is because the original statement establishes that the presence of the vampire being awake prevents the mummy from being awake. Therefore, if the mummy is awake (the opposite of the mummy not being awake), it must mean that the condition preventing the mummy from being awake (the vampire being awake) does not hold.\n\nThus, the statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was not awake\" logically implies \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
