            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\" This can be represented in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"the book was written by James\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the book is a mystery novel\". The statement \\( \\neg Q \\) represents \"the book is not a mystery novel\".\n\n2. We need to determine if this implies the second statement: \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\n3. To see if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) implies \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), we can use the logical equivalence known as contraposition. The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). According to the rules of logic, a statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent.\n\n4. Therefore, since \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is given as true, its contrapositive \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\nThus, from the statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel,\" we can indeed infer that \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
