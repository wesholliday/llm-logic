            "content": "To solve this, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg W \\)\n   where \\( B \\) represents \"the bear was in the cave\" and \\( W \\) represents \"the wolf was in the den\". The statement \\( \\neg W \\) means \"the wolf was not in the den\".\n\n2. We need to determine if this implies the statement: \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( W \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)\n\n3. To see if \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg W \\) implies \\( W \\rightarrow \\neg B \\), we consider the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive of \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg W \\) is \\( W \\rightarrow \\neg B \\), which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. Since the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the statement itself, \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg W \\) does indeed imply \\( W \\rightarrow \\neg B \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
