This new statement can be represented as \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg A \\).\n\nTo determine if \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) can be inferred from \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg C \\), we need to understand the logical relationship between the two. The statement \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) implies that if \\( A \\) is true (Alex finished the race), then \\( C \\) must be false (Chris did not finish the race). Conversely, if \\( C \\) is true (Chris finished the race), then \\( A \\) must be false (Alex did not finish the race) to maintain the truth of the original statement \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg C \\).\n\nThus, \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) is the contrapositive of \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg C \\), and in logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. Therefore, from the statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris did not finish the race,\" we can indeed infer \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
