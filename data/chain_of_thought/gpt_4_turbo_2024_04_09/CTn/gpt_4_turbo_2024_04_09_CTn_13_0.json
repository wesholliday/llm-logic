            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the car was red, then the truck was not blue.\" In logical terms, this can be written as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"the car was red\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"the truck was blue\".\n\n2. The statement we need to infer is: \"If the truck was blue, then the car was not red.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\n3. To determine if \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), we need to understand the logical equivalence or implication. The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\n4. Since the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the statement itself, \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is indeed a valid inference from \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
