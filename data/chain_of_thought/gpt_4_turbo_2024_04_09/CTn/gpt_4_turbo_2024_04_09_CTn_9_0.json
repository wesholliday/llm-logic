            "content": "To solve this, let's analyze the logical structure of the statements:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" In logical terms, this can be written as: If L (Lisa bought the red shirt), then not M (Mark did not buy the blue shirt).\n\n2. The statement to be inferred is: \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" In logical terms, this is: If M (Mark bought the blue shirt), then not L (Lisa did not buy the red shirt).\n\nThe original statement establishes a conditional relationship where Lisa buying the red shirt implies Mark cannot buy the blue shirt. This logically means that if Mark did buy the blue shirt, the condition under which Lisa could buy the red shirt would not be met. Therefore, Lisa could not have bought the red shirt.\n\nThis is a contrapositive relationship in logic, where the contrapositive of a statement \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P,\" and both statements are logically equivalent. Thus, the statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" is logically equivalent to \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
