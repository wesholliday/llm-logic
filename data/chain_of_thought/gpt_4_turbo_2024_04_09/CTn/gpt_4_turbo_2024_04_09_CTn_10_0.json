            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the given statement and its contrapositive.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was not outside.\" In logical terms, this can be written as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"the dog was inside\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the cat was outside\".\n\n2. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the contrapositive of our statement is:\n   \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   which translates to \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside.\"\n\n3. Since the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, the answer to whether we can infer \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside\" from \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was not outside\" is affirmative.\n\nAnswer: yes",
