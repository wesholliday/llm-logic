            "content": "To solve this, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) represents \"the pants were not denim.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if this implies the statement: \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   where \\( Q \\) represents \"the pants were denim\" and \\( \\neg P \\) represents \"the shirt was not cotton.\"\n\n3. To see if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) implies \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), we can use the contrapositive rule in logic. The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). Since a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is true, then \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\nThus, from the statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim,\" we can indeed infer that \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
