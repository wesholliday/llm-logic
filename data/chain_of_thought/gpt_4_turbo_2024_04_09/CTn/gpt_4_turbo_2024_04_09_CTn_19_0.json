            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\" In logical terms, this can be written as: \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg J \\), where \\( T \\) represents \"Tom watched football\" and \\( J \\) represents \"Jen watched basketball\".\n\n2. We need to determine if this statement implies the converse: \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\" This can be written as: \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\).\n\n3. To see if \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) implies \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\), we can consider the truth table for \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg J \\):\n   - If \\( T \\) is true and \\( J \\) is true, then \\( \\neg J \\) is false, making \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) false.\n   - If \\( T \\) is true and \\( J \\) is false, then \\( \\neg J \\) is true, making \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) true.\n   - If \\( T \\) is false (regardless of \\( J \\)), \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) is true because a false hypothesis always makes an implication true.\n\n4. Now, let's consider the truth table for \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\):\n   - If \\( J \\) is true and \\( T \\) is true, then \\( \\neg T \\) is false, making \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) false.\n   - If \\( J \\) is true and \\( T \\) is false, then \\( \\neg T \\) is true, making \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) true.\n   - If \\( J \\) is false (regardless of \\( T \\)), \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) is true because a false hypothesis always makes an implication true.\n\n5. Comparing these, we see that the truth values of \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) do not always match the truth values of \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\). Specifically, if \\( T \\) is true and \\( J \\) is false, \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) is true, but \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) is also true, which does not contradict. However, if both \\( T \\) and \\( J \\) are false, \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) is true, but \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) is also true, which again does not contradict. The critical case is when \\( T \\) is true and \\( J \\) is true, which cannot happen under \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) but would make \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) false if it could happen.\n\n6. Thus, the implication \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) logically leads to \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) because the only case where \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) is false is when \\( T \\) is true and \\( J \\) is true, which would also make \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) false. However, since \\( T \\) being true prevents \\( J \\) from being true, \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) holds whenever \\( J \\) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
