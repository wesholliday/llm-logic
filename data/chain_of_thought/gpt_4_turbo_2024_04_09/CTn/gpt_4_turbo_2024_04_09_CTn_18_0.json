            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was not metal.\" In logical terms, this can be written as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg M \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"the doll was plastic\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the truck was metal\".\n\n2. We need to determine if this statement implies the converse: \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\n3. To see if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) implies \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), we can use the contrapositive. The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) is:\n   \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   This is because the contrapositive of a statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\), which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. Since the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) is \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and since a statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent, it follows that:\n   \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was not metal\" does indeed imply \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
