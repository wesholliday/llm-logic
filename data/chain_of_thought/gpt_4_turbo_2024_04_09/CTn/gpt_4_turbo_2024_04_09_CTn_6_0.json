            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), where \\( P \\) represents \"Sue chose pizza\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"Bob chose pasta\".\n\n2. The statement we need to infer is: \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\" This can be written as: \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\n3. To determine if the inference is valid, we need to check if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) logically implies \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\n4. Using the rules of logic, \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is equivalent to \\( \\neg P \\lor \\neg Q \\). Similarly, \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is equivalent to \\( \\neg Q \\lor \\neg P \\).\n\n5. Notice that \\( \\neg P \\lor \\neg Q \\) is the same as \\( \\neg Q \\lor \\neg P \\) due to the commutative property of disjunction (OR).\n\n6. Since both expressions are equivalent, it follows that \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) does indeed imply \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta,\" we can infer that \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
