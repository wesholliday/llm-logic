            "content": "To analyze the given statements, we can use logical reasoning:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\" In logical terms, this can be written as:\n   \\( G \\rightarrow \\neg U \\)\n   where \\( G \\) represents \"the griffin was in the forest\" and \\( \\neg U \\) represents \"the unicorn was not in the forest.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if the following statement is true based on the original statement: \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( U \\rightarrow \\neg G \\)\n\n3. To infer \\( U \\rightarrow \\neg G \\) from \\( G \\rightarrow \\neg U \\), we need to establish a logical connection. The contrapositive of \\( G \\rightarrow \\neg U \\) is \\( U \\rightarrow \\neg G \\). The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if \\( G \\rightarrow \\neg U \\) is true, then \\( U \\rightarrow \\neg G \\) must also be true.\n\n4. Thus, based on the logical equivalence of a statement and its contrapositive, we can infer that if the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest, given the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
