            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement is a conditional statement:\n\n1. \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter.\"\n\nThis can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg R \\)\nwhere \\( A \\) represents \"the alien visited Mars\" and \\( R \\) represents \"the robot visited Jupiter\". The \\( \\rightarrow \\) symbolizes \"implies\", and \\( \\neg \\) symbolizes \"not\".\n\nThe question asks whether we can infer the following statement from the original:\n2. \"If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\"\n\nThis can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( R \\rightarrow \\neg A \\)\n\nTo determine if we can infer statement 2 from statement 1, we need to understand if \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg R \\) logically implies \\( R \\rightarrow \\neg A \\).\n\nUsing the contrapositive in logic, which states that \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is logically equivalent to \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), we can rewrite statement 1's contrapositive:\n   \\( \\neg (\\neg R) \\rightarrow \\neg A \\)\n   \\( R \\rightarrow \\neg A \\)\n\nThis shows that the contrapositive of statement 1 is exactly statement 2. Therefore, statement 1 does indeed imply statement 2.\n\nAnswer: yes",
