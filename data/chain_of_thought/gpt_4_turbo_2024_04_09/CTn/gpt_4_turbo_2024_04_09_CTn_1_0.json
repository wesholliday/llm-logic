            "content": "To solve this, let's analyze the given statement and its logical implications:\n\n1. The statement given is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\" In logical terms, this can be written as: \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\), where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"Sue was not at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The statement we need to infer is: \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\" This can be written as: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\).\n\n3. To determine if \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) can be inferred from \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\), we need to understand the logical relationship between the two. The original statement \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) asserts that the presence of Mary at the wedding guarantees the absence of Sue. However, it does not explicitly state what happens if Sue is present at the wedding.\n\n4. The contrapositive of \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\). In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. Therefore, if \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is true, then \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) must also be true.\n\n5. Thus, from the statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding,\" we can indeed infer that \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding,\" because the contrapositive of a true conditional statement is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
