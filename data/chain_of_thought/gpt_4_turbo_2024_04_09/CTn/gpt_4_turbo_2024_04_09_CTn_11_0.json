            "content": "To solve this, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\" In logical terms, this can be written as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"the cake was chocolate\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"the muffins were blueberry\".\n\n2. The statement we need to infer is: \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\n3. To determine if \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), we need to understand the logical equivalence or implication. The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). According to the rules of logic, a statement is always logically equivalent to its contrapositive.\n\n4. Since \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), and because a statement is equivalent to its contrapositive, we can conclude that if \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\" is true, then \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
