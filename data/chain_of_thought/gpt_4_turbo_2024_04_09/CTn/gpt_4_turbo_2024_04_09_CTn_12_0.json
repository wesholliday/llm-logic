            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg L \\), where \\( J \\) represents \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( L \\) represents \"Lucy went to the zoo\".\n\n2. The statement we need to evaluate is: \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\" This can be written as: \\( L \\rightarrow \\neg J \\).\n\n3. To determine if the second statement logically follows from the first, we need to understand the implication of \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg L \\). This statement means that whenever Joe goes to the park, Lucy does not go to the zoo. The contrapositive of this statement, which is logically equivalent, is \\( L \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) (If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park).\n\n4. Since the contrapositive of a statement is always true if the original statement is true, and since the contrapositive of \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg L \\) is \\( L \\rightarrow \\neg J \\), we can conclude that the statement \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\" is indeed a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
