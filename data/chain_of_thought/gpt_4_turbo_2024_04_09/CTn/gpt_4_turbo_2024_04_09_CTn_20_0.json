            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow.\" In logical terms, this can be written as:\n   \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)\n   where \\( A \\) represents \"the apple was red\" and \\( B \\) represents \"the banana was yellow\".\n\n2. We need to determine if this statement implies the converse: \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\)\n\n3. To see if \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) implies \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\), we can consider the truth table for \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) and see if it matches with \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\):\n\n   - If \\( A \\) is true and \\( B \\) is true, \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) is false (since \\( \\neg B \\) is false).\n   - If \\( A \\) is true and \\( B \\) is false, \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) is true (since \\( \\neg B \\) is true).\n   - If \\( A \\) is false and \\( B \\) is true, \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) is true (since \\( A \\) being false makes the implication true regardless of \\( B \\)).\n   - If \\( A \\) is false and \\( B \\) is false, \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) is true (since \\( A \\) being false makes the implication true regardless of \\( B \\)).\n\n4. Now, let's check \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\):\n\n   - If \\( B \\) is true and \\( A \\) is true, \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) is false (since \\( \\neg A \\) is false).\n   - If \\( B \\) is true and \\( A \\) is false, \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) is true (since \\( \\neg A \\) is true).\n   - If \\( B \\) is false and \\( A \\) is true, \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) is true (since \\( B \\) being false makes the implication true regardless of \\( A \\)).\n   - If \\( B \\) is false and \\( A \\) is false, \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) is true (since \\( B \\) being false makes the implication true regardless of \\( A \\)).\n\n5. Comparing the truth tables, we see that in the case where \\( A \\) is true and \\( B \\) is true, \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) is false, but \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) is also false. In all other cases, both implications are true. Therefore, the truth tables match in all scenarios.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude that the statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow\" does indeed imply \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
