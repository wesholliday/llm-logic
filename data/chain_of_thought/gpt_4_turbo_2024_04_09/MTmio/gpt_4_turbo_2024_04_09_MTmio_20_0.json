            "content": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the statements given and their logical implications:\n\n1. \"The banana might not have been yellow\" - This statement suggests that there is a possibility that the banana was not yellow. It does not confirm the color of the banana; it only opens up the possibility that the banana could have been a color other than yellow.\n\n2. \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that the condition of the apple being red guarantees that the banana was yellow.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these statements together:\n\n- If it were true that \"the apple was red,\" then according to the second statement, \"the banana must have been yellow.\" However, the first statement tells us that it's possible the banana was not yellow.\n\nGiven that there is a possibility that the banana was not yellow, and knowing that if the apple were red, the banana would necessarily be yellow (from the second statement), we can conclude that the condition that would make the banana necessarily yellow (the apple being red) did not occur. \n\nTherefore, since the banana might not have been yellow, and if the apple were red, the banana would have to be yellow, it follows logically that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
