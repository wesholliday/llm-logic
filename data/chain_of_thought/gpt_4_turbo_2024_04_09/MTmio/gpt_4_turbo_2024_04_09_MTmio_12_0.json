            "content": "To solve this, let's analyze the statements given:\n\n1. \"Lucy might not have gone to the zoo\" - This implies that there is a possibility that Lucy did not go to the zoo. It does not confirm whether she went or not, but it opens up the possibility that she might not have.\n\n2. \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" - This is a conditional statement. If the condition (Joe went to the park) is true, then the result (Lucy must have gone to the zoo) must also be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n- If Joe did go to the park, then according to the second statement, Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This would contradict the possibility allowed in the first statement that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo.\n- Therefore, if we accept the possibility that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo, then we must conclude that Joe did not go to the park, because him going to the park necessitates Lucy going to the zoo, which conflicts with the possibility that she might not have.\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
