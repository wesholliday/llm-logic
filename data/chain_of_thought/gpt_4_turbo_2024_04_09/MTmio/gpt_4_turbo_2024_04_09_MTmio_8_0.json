            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the statements given:\n\n1. \"The mummy might not have been awake\" implies that it is possible that the mummy was not awake.\n2. \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake\" is a conditional statement that establishes a dependency between the vampire being awake and the mummy being awake.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the truth of the vampire being awake guarantees that the mummy was awake. This is a direct implication where the condition of the vampire being awake necessitates the mummy's awakeness.\n\nGiven the first statement, we consider the possibility that the mummy was not awake. If this were true (that the mummy was not awake), then according to the second statement, the vampire could not have been awake either, because if the vampire were awake, it would contradict the possibility of the mummy not being awake (as the vampire being awake implies the mummy must be awake).\n\nTherefore, if it is possible that the mummy was not awake, then it must be true that the vampire was not awake, to maintain consistency with both statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
