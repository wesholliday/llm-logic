            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the statements given:\n\n1. \"The unicorn might not have been in the forest\" implies that there is a possibility that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\n2. \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest\" establishes a conditional relationship where the presence of the griffin in the forest necessitates the presence of the unicorn in the forest.\n\nGiven these statements, let's consider the scenario where the griffin was in the forest. According to the second statement, if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must also have been in the forest. This would contradict the first statement that it is possible for the unicorn not to be in the forest.\n\nTherefore, if we accept that it is possible for the unicorn not to be in the forest, then the presence of the griffin in the forest would create a contradiction. To avoid this contradiction, we must conclude that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
