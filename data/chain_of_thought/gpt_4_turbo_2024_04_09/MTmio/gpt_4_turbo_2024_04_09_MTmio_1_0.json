            "content": "To solve this, let's analyze the statements given:\n\n1. \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\" - This suggests that there is a possibility that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\n2. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" - This is a conditional statement indicating that Sue's presence at the wedding is necessary if Mary was there.\n\nFrom these statements, we need to determine if we can infer \"Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n- If Mary was at the wedding, then according to the second statement, Sue must also have been at the wedding. This would contradict the first statement that Sue might not have been at the wedding, as it would mean Sue definitely was at the wedding.\n- If Mary was not at the wedding, then the condition \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" does not apply, and it does not contradict the possibility that Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n\nGiven that the only scenario where both statements hold true without contradiction is when Mary was not at the wedding, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
