            "content": "To solve this, let's analyze the statements given:\n\n1. \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\" - This implies that there is a possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, but it does not confirm whether he did or did not buy it.\n\n2. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" - This is a conditional statement indicating that Lisa buying the red shirt guarantees that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nFrom these statements, consider the scenario where Lisa did buy the red shirt. According to the second statement, if Lisa bought the red shirt, then it must be true that Mark bought the blue shirt. However, the first statement tells us that it's possible that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. \n\nIf we assume Lisa bought the red shirt, then by the conditional statement, Mark must have bought the blue shirt, which contradicts the possibility presented in the first statement that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. Therefore, assuming Lisa bought the red shirt leads to a contradiction.\n\nThus, to avoid contradiction and maintain consistency in the statements, we must conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
