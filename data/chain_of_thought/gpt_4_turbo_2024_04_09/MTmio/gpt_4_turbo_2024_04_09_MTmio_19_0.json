            "content": "To solve this, let's analyze the statements given:\n\n1. \"Jen might not have watched basketball\" - This implies there is a possibility that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\n2. \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\" - This is a conditional statement. If the first part (Tom watched football) is true, then the second part (Jen must have watched basketball) must also be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n- If Tom did watch football, according to the second statement, Jen must have watched basketball. However, the first statement allows for the possibility that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nGiven that there is a possibility that Jen did not watch basketball, and if she didn't, the condition that \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\" would be violated if Tom had watched football. Therefore, to maintain the truth of the conditional statement while acknowledging the possibility that Jen might not have watched basketball, we must conclude that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
