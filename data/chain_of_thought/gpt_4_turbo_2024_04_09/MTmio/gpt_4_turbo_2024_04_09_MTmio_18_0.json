            "content": "To solve this, let's analyze the statements given:\n\n1. \"The truck might not have been metal\" - This suggests that there is a possibility that the truck was not made of metal.\n\n2. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" - This is a conditional statement. If the condition (the doll being plastic) is true, then the result (the truck being metal) must also be true.\n\nNow, let's use these statements to infer about the material of the doll:\n\n- Assume the doll was plastic. According to the second statement, if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. However, the first statement tells us that it's possible the truck was not metal. This presents a contradiction because if the doll was plastic, the truck cannot be anything but metal.\n\n- Since assuming the doll was plastic leads to a contradiction with the possibility that the truck might not have been metal, the assumption that the doll was plastic must be false.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
