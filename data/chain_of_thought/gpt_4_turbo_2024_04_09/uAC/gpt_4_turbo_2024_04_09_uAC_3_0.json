This is a classic example of trying to affirm the antecedent from the consequent, which is a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. Just because the consequent (Q) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (P) must be true. There could be other reasons or authors that could make Q true.\n\nTherefore, from the information given, we cannot definitively conclude that P (the book was written by James) just because Q (the book is a mystery novel) is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
