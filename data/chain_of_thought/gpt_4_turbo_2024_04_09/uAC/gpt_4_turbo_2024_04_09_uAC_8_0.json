The mummy was awake.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be written as:\n- If V (vampire was awake), then M (mummy was awake).\n\nThe second statement confirms:\n- M (mummy was awake) is true.\n\nFrom these statements, we need to determine if V (vampire was awake) is necessarily true.\n\nThe logical structure here is important. The first statement is a conditional that establishes what happens if the vampire is awake, not what must be true if the mummy is awake. The truth of M (mummy was awake) does not necessarily imply the truth of V (vampire was awake) because the conditional statement does not work in reverse without additional information (this would be the fallacy of affirming the consequent).\n\nTherefore, knowing that the mummy was awake does not allow us to infer with certainty that the vampire was also awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
