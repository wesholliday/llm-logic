            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship given in the statements:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n2. Sue was at the wedding.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If M (Mary was at the wedding), then S (Sue was at the wedding). This statement tells us that Mary's presence at the wedding guarantees Sue's presence, but it does not necessarily imply that if Sue is at the wedding, Mary must also be there. \n\nThe second statement simply confirms that Sue was indeed at the wedding.\n\nFrom these statements, we know that Sue's presence at the wedding is confirmed, but this does not provide direct information about Mary's presence. The first statement does not work backwards automatically (it is not an \"if and only if\" statement); it only specifies a condition based on Mary's attendance.\n\nTherefore, knowing that Sue was at the wedding does not allow us to definitively conclude that Mary was also at the wedding. Mary might have been there, or she might not have been; the information given does not specify.\n\nAnswer: no",
