In logical terms, this is written as A \u2192 C.\n\nThe statement \"Chris finished the race\" tells us that C is true.\n\nHowever, knowing C (Chris finished the race) does not allow us to definitively conclude A (Alex finished the race) based solely on the statement A \u2192 C. The implication A \u2192 C only tells us that if A is true, then C must be true. It does not tell us that if C is true, then A must be true. This is a classic example of confusing the converse of a statement with the original statement. The converse would be C \u2192 A, which is not what is given.\n\nTherefore, from the information that Chris finished the race, we cannot infer that Alex finished the race without additional information about Alex's performance.\n\nAnswer: no",
