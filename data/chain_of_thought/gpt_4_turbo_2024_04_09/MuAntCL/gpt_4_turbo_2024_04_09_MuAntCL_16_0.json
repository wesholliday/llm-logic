            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The room must have been cleaned daily\" specifically addresses the frequency of cleaning the room. However, it does not provide any information about whether fresh towels were provided as part of that cleaning routine. The addition of \"and had fresh towels\" introduces a new element that is not covered by the original statement. Without explicit information or evidence that fresh towels were included in the daily cleaning, we cannot logically infer that from the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
