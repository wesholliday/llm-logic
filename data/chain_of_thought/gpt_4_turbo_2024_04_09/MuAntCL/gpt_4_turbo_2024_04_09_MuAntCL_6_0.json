            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The concert must have been sold out\" specifically addresses the status of ticket sales for the concert, indicating that all tickets were sold. However, this statement does not provide any information about the time the concert started. To infer \"The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM\" from the original statement, we would need additional information confirming the start time of the concert. Since the original statement does not mention the time, we cannot logically conclude both that the concert was sold out and that it started at 8 PM based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
