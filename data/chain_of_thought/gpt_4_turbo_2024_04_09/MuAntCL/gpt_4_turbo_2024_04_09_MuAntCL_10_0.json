The statement \"The document must have been signed\" explicitly indicates that the document was signed. However, it does not provide any information about whether the document was also notarized. Notarization is a specific process that involves a notary public who verifies the identities of the signers and the authenticity of the signatures, typically marking the document with a notarial seal. Since the original statement only mentions the signing of the document and does not mention notarization, we cannot logically conclude that the document was notarized based solely on the information given in the statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
