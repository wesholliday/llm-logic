However, this statement does not explicitly include any information about whether the software was also restarted after the update. The addition of \"and restarted\" introduces a new element that is not covered by the original statement. Without additional information that links the update directly to a restart, or a general rule that software updates always require a restart, we cannot logically infer that the software was also restarted just from the information given in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
