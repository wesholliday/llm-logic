            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package must have been delivered yesterday\" asserts a belief or conclusion about the delivery of the package, specifically its occurrence on a particular day. However, this statement does not include any information about whether the package was signed for upon delivery. The addition of \"and signed for\" introduces a new element that was not addressed in the original statement. Without additional information indicating that signing was required or occurred, we cannot logically infer that the package was both delivered and signed for based solely on the information that it was delivered. Therefore, the inference that the package was both delivered yesterday and signed for is not supported by the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
