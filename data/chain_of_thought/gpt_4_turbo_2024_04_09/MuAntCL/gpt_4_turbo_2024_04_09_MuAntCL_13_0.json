            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The movie must have been in English\" specifically addresses the language in which the movie was primarily made or presented. This statement alone does not provide any information about whether the movie had subtitles. Subtitles can be included in movies for various reasons, such as accessibility for the hearing impaired or for viewers who speak different languages, but their presence is not implied solely by the language of the movie. Therefore, from the statement that the movie was in English, we cannot infer that it also had subtitles, as these are two separate attributes.\n\nAnswer: no",
