It does not provide any information about the content or additional requirements of the application, such as whether it needed to include references. To infer that the application must have included references from the statement that it must have been completed online would require additional information linking online completion with the inclusion of references. Since no such information is provided in the statement, we cannot logically make that inference based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
