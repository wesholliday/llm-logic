To infer that \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM and in the conference room,\" we would need additional information indicating that the meeting was indeed in the conference room. Since the original statement only mentions the time and not the location, we cannot logically conclude anything about where the meeting took place based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
