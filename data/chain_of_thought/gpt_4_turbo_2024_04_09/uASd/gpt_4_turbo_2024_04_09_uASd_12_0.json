            "content": "The statement given is \"If I finish my homework, I can play video games.\" This is a conditional statement where finishing homework is a sufficient condition for being able to play video games. \n\nThe question asks whether, if you finish your homework and your computer catches on fire, you can still play video games. The original condition for playing video games is finishing your homework, which has been met. However, the additional condition introduced is that the computer catches on fire. \n\nThe ability to play video games typically depends on having a functioning computer or console. If the computer catches on fire, it is likely no longer functional, which would prevent playing video games. \n\nHowever, the original statement does not specify that the ability to play video games is contingent on the computer not catching fire or any other external factors. It only specifies that finishing homework allows for playing video games. \n\nTherefore, based strictly on the logical structure of the original statement, the additional circumstance of the computer catching fire does not alter the logical conclusion derived from the original condition. The statement does not address the functionality of the computer or any other conditions that might prevent playing video games other than not finishing homework.\n\nAnswer: yes",
