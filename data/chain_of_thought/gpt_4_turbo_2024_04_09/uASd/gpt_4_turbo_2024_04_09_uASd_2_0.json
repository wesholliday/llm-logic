The original statement only guarantees a good time under the condition of attending the concert, without any additional adverse events like a bomb going off.\n\nThe occurrence of a bomb going off could significantly alter the circumstances and likely impact whether or not attendees have a good time, due to potential danger, fear, injuries, or chaos. Therefore, the new condition (a bomb going off) could negate the original consequent (having a good time).\n\nThus, we cannot logically infer that if we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, we will still have a good time, based on the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
