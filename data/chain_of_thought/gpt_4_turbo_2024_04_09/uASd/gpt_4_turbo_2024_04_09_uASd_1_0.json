            "content": "To answer this question, we need to consider the conditions under which a match will light when struck. Typically, a match lights due to the friction generated when struck against a suitable surface, igniting the chemicals on the match head.\n\nHowever, if a match has been soaked in water, the chemicals on the match head are likely to be wet and thus unable to ignite properly. Water generally impairs the match's ability to light because it prevents the necessary friction and chemical reaction from occurring effectively.\n\nGiven this, even though the initial statement is true (if the match is struck, then it will light), the added condition of the match being soaked in water changes the outcome. The presence of water negates the initial condition's effectiveness in causing the match to light.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that a match that has been struck and has been soaked in water will light.\n\nAnswer: no",
