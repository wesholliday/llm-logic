The original statement does not specify any conditions about the stock status of the item affecting the shipment. It only states that the placement of the order leads to the item being shipped, without any exceptions mentioned.\n\nGiven this, even if the item is out of stock, according to the original statement, as long as the order is placed, the item will ship. There is no information provided that contradicts or modifies this condition based on the stock status.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given:\n\nAnswer: yes",
