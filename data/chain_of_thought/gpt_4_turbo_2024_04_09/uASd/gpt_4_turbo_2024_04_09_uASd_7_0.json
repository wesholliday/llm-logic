            "content": "To solve this, let's analyze the given statement and the condition:\n\n1. The statement \"If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm\" implies a direct relationship between the oven being on and the kitchen being warm. This suggests that the oven being on is a sufficient condition for the kitchen to be warm.\n\n2. The additional condition \"the pilot light is out\" introduces a new element. The pilot light is typically a small flame in gas ovens that ignites the main burner. If the pilot light is out, it might imply that the oven cannot be on in the usual way, as there is no flame to ignite the gas for the oven to operate properly.\n\n3. However, the statement we are analyzing does not specify the type of oven or the dependence of the oven's operation on the pilot light. It simply states that if the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm.\n\n4. Given that the statement does not specify the dependency of the oven's functionality on the pilot light, and it does not detail the type of oven, we must rely solely on the information provided: if the oven is on, regardless of the state of the pilot light, the kitchen is warm.\n\n5. Therefore, even with the pilot light out, if the oven is somehow still on (perhaps it's an electric oven or has an alternative ignition system), the condition that the oven being on leads to the kitchen being warm still holds.\n\nAnswer: yes",
