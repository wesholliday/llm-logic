The use of \"or\" in this context suggests that either method is sufficient but not that both are required. Therefore, inferring that \"The application must have been completed in person\" exclusively would be incorrect because it ignores the possibility of completing it online, which is equally valid according to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
