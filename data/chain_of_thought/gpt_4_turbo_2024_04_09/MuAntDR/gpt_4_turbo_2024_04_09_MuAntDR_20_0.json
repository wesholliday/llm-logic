This statement does not exclusively commit to one type over the other; it merely presents two possibilities. To infer from this that \"The event must have been semi-formal\" would be to ignore the possibility that the event could have been formal. Therefore, the inference is not logically valid because it excludes one of the possibilities explicitly mentioned in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
