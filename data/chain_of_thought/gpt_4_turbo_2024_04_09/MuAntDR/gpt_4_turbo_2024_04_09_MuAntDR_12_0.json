            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday or extended\" presents two possibilities for the status of the project by Friday. These possibilities are mutually exclusive and cover all potential outcomes by the specified time. The use of \"or\" in the statement indicates that either the project was completed by Friday, or it was extended. It does not imply that both events occurred, nor does it imply that only one specific event (extension) definitely happened without knowing additional specific information about the actual outcome. Therefore, from the given statement alone, we cannot definitively infer that \"The project must have been extended\" without knowing which of the two possibilities actually occurred.\n\nAnswer: no",
