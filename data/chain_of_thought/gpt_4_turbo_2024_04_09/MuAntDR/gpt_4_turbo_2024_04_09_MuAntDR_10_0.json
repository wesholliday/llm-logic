            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been signed or notarized\" implies that there are two acceptable conditions for the document: it could either be signed or it could be notarized. The use of \"or\" in this context suggests that either one of the conditions being true is sufficient, but does not necessarily mean that both conditions must be met. Therefore, from this statement alone, we cannot conclude that the document must have been notarized, as it being signed would also satisfy the requirement.\n\nAnswer: no",
