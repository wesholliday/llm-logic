            "content": "To analyze the given statements and determine if we can infer that Mary was at the wedding, we need to understand the logical relationship between the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be represented as: If M, then S (where M stands for \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S stands for \"Sue was at the wedding\").\n\n2. The second statement is a declaration: \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This is simply S.\n\nThe question is whether from these two statements, we can infer that Mary was at the wedding (M).\n\nIn logical terms, knowing that \"If M, then S\" (if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding) and knowing that S (Sue was at the wedding) does not necessarily imply M (Mary was at the wedding). The conditional statement only specifies what happens if Mary is at the wedding (i.e., Sue must also be there), but it does not state that Mary being at the wedding is the only way for Sue to be there. Sue could be at the wedding regardless of whether Mary is there or not.\n\nThus, from the information given, we cannot logically infer that Mary was at the wedding just because Sue was there. This is a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent.\n\nAnswer: no",
