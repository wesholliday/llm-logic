            "content": "To analyze the logical relationship in the question, we start by understanding the structure of the statements given:\n\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If P, then Q (where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding\").\n\n2. \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a statement affirming Q.\n\nThe question asks whether from these two statements, we can conclude \"Mary was at the wedding\" (P).\n\nIn logical terms, knowing Q (Sue was at the wedding) does not necessarily imply P (Mary was at the wedding). The original conditional statement (If P, then Q) only specifies what happens if P is true; it does not state that P must be true if Q is true. This is a classic example of the logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\"\n\nTherefore, from the information given (Sue was at the wedding), we cannot logically conclude that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
