            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze whether the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises given. The argument can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. Premise 1: If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. (If P, then Q)\n2. Premise 2: It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. (Not Q)\n3. Conclusion: Tom did not watch football. (Not P)\n\nThis argument is a classic example of modus tollens, a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus tollens states that if \"If P then Q\" is true and \"Q is false\" (Not Q) is true, then \"P is false\" (Not P) must also be true.\n\nGiven that the premises are:\n- If P (Tom watched football), then Q (Jen must have watched basketball).\n- Not Q (Jen did not watch basketball).\n\nWe can conclude:\n- Not P (Tom did not watch football).\n\nSince the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
