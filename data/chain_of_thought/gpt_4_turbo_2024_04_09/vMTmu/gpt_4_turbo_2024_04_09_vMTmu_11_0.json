            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the cake was chocolate\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the muffins must have been blueberry.\"\n\n2. The second premise is a negation of \\( Q \\): \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\" Symbolically, this is \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is \"The cake was not chocolate,\" which is symbolically \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nThe argument structure here is:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- \\( \\neg Q \\)\n- Therefore, \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nThis is a form of argument known as modus tollens, which is a valid argument form. Modus tollens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) are both true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens structure, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
