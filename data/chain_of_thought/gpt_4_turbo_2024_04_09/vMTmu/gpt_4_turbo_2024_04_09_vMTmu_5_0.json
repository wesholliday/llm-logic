            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( J \\rightarrow A \\), where \\( J \\) stands for \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) stands for \"Amy must have played tennis.\"\n\n2. The second premise is a negation: \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\" Symbolically, this is \\( \\neg A \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn from these premises is \"Jeff did not play basketball,\" which can be symbolically represented as \\( \\neg J \\).\n\nTo test the validity of the argument, we need to see if the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. This involves checking if the logical structure holds under all circumstances.\n\n- From the first premise \\( J \\rightarrow A \\), we know that if \\( J \\) is true, then \\( A \\) must also be true.\n- From the second premise \\( \\neg A \\), we know that \\( A \\) is false.\n\nGiven that \\( A \\) is false, and \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) (meaning \\( J \\) being true implies \\( A \\) must be true), \\( J \\) must be false to maintain the truth of the first premise while \\( A \\) is false. This is because if \\( J \\) were true, then \\( A \\) would also have to be true, contradicting the second premise.\n\nThus, the premises \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) and \\( \\neg A \\) together logically necessitate \\( \\neg J \\). Therefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg J \\) (Jeff did not play basketball) follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nThis shows that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
