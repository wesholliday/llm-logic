            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" Symbolically, this can be represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the apple was red\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the banana must have been yellow.\"\n\n2. The second premise is a negation of the consequent of the first premise: \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\" Symbolically, this is \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is \"The apple was not red.\" Symbolically, this is \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nThe argument structure here is a classic example of modus tollens, a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus tollens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) are both true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\nGiven that the premises are:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow)\n- \\( \\neg Q \\) (It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow)\n\nThe valid conclusion according to modus tollens would be:\n- \\( \\neg P \\) (The apple was not red)\n\nThus, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises according to the rules of logic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
