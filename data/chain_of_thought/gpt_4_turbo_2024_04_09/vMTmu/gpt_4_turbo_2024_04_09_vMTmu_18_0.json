            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" We can represent this as: P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck must have been metal.\"\n\n2. The second premise is a negation of the consequent of the first premise: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\" This can be represented as: \u00acQ.\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is \"The doll was not plastic,\" which can be represented as: \u00acP.\n\nThe argument structure here is a classic example of modus tollens, a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus tollens states that if P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP. This means if the first premise is true (if P then Q) and the second premise is true (not Q), then the conclusion must be true (not P).\n\nGiven that the structure of the argument matches modus tollens, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
