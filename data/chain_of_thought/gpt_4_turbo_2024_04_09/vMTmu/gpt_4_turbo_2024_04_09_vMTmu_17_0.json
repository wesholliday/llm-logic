            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\" This can be symbolically represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q is \"Kate must have eaten salad.\"\n\n2. The second premise is a negation of the consequent of the first premise: \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad.\" This can be symbolically represented as \u00acQ.\n\n3. The conclusion drawn from these premises is \"Ben did not eat pasta,\" which can be symbolically represented as \u00acP.\n\nThe argument structure here is a classic example of modus tollens, a valid form of argument in logic. Modus tollens states that if P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP. Applying this to the given argument:\n- If P \u2192 Q (If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad)\n- \u00acQ (It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad)\n- Therefore, \u00acP (Therefore, Ben did not eat pasta)\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens structure, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
