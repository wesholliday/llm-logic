            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\" This can be symbolically represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q is \"Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\n\n2. The second premise is a negation of the consequent of the first premise: \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\" This can be symbolically represented as \u00acQ.\n\n3. The conclusion drawn from these premises is \"Sue did not choose pizza,\" which can be symbolically represented as \u00acP.\n\nThe argument structure here is a classic example of modus tollens, a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus tollens states that if P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP. Applying this to the given argument:\n\n- If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. (P \u2192 Q)\n- It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta. (\u00acQ)\n- Therefore, Sue did not choose pizza. (\u00acP)\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens structure, it is logically valid. The conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
