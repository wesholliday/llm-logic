            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze whether the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises given. The argument can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. Premise 1: If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside. (If D, then C)\n2. Premise 2: It's not the case that the cat must have been outside. (Not C)\n3. Conclusion: The dog was not inside. (Not D)\n\nThis argument is a form of modus tollens, a valid logical rule which states that if \"If P then Q\" is true and \"Not Q\" is true, then \"Not P\" must also be true. Applying modus tollens to the given premises:\n\n- \"If D then C\" is analogous to \"If P then Q\".\n- \"Not C\" is analogous to \"Not Q\".\n- Therefore, \"Not D\" (the conclusion) follows logically, which is analogous to \"Not P\".\n\nSince the argument follows the structure of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
