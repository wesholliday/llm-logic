            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This negates \\( Q \\), so it is represented as \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is \"Mary was not at the wedding,\" which is the negation of \\( P \\), represented as \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nThe argument structure is:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- \\( \\neg Q \\)\n- Therefore, \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nThis is a valid form of argument known as modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) are both true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true. Since the premises logically lead to the conclusion in this structure, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
