            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where:\n   - \\( P \\) = The shirt was cotton\n   - \\( Q \\) = The pants must have been denim\n\n2. The second premise is a negation of the consequent of the first premise: \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is \"The shirt was not cotton,\" which can be symbolically represented as \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nThe argument structure here is a classic example of modus tollens, which is a valid argument form. Modus tollens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) are both true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\nGiven the premises:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim)\n   - \\( \\neg Q \\) (It's not the case that the pants must have been denim)\n\nWe can validly conclude:\n   - \\( \\neg P \\) (The shirt was not cotton)\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises according to the rules of modus tollens, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
