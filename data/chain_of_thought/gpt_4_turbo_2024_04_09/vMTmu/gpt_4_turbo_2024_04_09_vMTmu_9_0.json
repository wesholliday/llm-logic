            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( L \\rightarrow M \\), where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( M \\) represents \"Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The second premise is the negation of \\( M \\): \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" Symbolically, this is \\( \\neg M \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt,\" which can be symbolically represented as \\( \\neg L \\).\n\nTo check if the argument is valid, we need to see if the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. In other words, if \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\) are both true, does it necessarily mean that \\( \\neg L \\) must also be true?\n\n- From \\( L \\rightarrow M \\), we know that if \\( L \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must be true.\n- From \\( \\neg M \\), we know that \\( M \\) is false.\n\nGiven that \\( M \\) is false, and \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) (meaning \\( L \\) being true would imply \\( M \\) being true), \\( L \\) must be false to maintain the truth of \\( L \\rightarrow M \\). If \\( L \\) were true, it would contradict the truth of \\( \\neg M \\) because \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) would require \\( M \\) to be true.\n\nThus, the premises \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\) together logically necessitate that \\( \\neg L \\) must be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
