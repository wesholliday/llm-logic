            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" Symbolically, this can be represented as \\( V \\rightarrow M \\), where \\( V \\) represents \"the vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the mummy must have been awake.\"\n\n2. The second premise is a negation: \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\" Symbolically, this is \\( \\neg M \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is \"The vampire was not awake,\" which can be symbolically represented as \\( \\neg V \\).\n\nTo check if the argument is valid, we need to see if the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. We can use the rules of logic to test this:\n\n- From the first premise \\( V \\rightarrow M \\), we know that if \\( V \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must be true.\n- From the second premise \\( \\neg M \\), we know that \\( M \\) is false.\n\nGiven that \\( M \\) is false (\\( \\neg M \\)), and \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) (if \\( V \\) were true, \\( M \\) would have to be true), the only possibility for both premises to be true is if \\( V \\) is false (\\( \\neg V \\)). This is because if \\( V \\) were true, it would contradict the truth of \\( \\neg M \\) since \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) would require \\( M \\) to be true.\n\nThus, the conclusion \\( \\neg V \\) (the vampire was not awake) necessarily follows from the premises, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
