            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" We can represent this as: If G, then U.\n\n2. The second premise is a negation: \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" We can represent this as: Not U.\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is: \"The griffin was not in the forest.\" We can represent this as: Not G.\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n- If G (griffin was in the forest), then U (unicorn must have been in the forest).\n- Not U (it's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest).\n- Therefore, Not G (the griffin was not in the forest).\n\nThis argument follows the form of modus tollens, a valid argument form in classical logic. Modus tollens states that if a conditional statement (If P, then Q) is true, and the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false. Here, P is G and Q is U.\n\nSince the premises logically lead to the conclusion following the modus tollens structure, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
