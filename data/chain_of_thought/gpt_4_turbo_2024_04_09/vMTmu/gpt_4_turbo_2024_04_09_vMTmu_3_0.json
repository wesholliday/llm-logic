            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where:\n   - \\( P \\) = The book was written by James\n   - \\( Q \\) = The book must be a mystery novel\n\n2. The second premise states: \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\" This is the negation of \\( Q \\), symbolically represented as \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is: \"The book was not written by James.\" This is the negation of \\( P \\), symbolically represented as \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nThe argument structure is:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- \\( \\neg Q \\)\n- Therefore, \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nThis is a valid form of argument known as modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) are both true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true. Since the premises logically lead to the conclusion following this rule, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
