The watch isn't on his wrist.\n\nFrom statement 1, we have two possibilities: the watch is either charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist. This is an example of a logical disjunction (an \"or\" statement), where at least one of the conditions must be true.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the watch is not on his wrist. Given that one of the two conditions from statement 1 must be true, and it has been established that the condition of the watch being on his wrist is false, the only remaining possibility that satisfies the original disjunction is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nTherefore, based on these statements and logical deduction, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
