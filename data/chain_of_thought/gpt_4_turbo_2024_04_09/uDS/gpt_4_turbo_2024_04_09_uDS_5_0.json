It is also stated that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry. \n\nGiven these two premises:\n1. The cookies are either in the jar or hidden in the pantry.\n2. The cookies are not hidden in the pantry.\n\nWe can use the process of elimination. Since the cookies are not in the pantry (second premise), the only remaining possibility from the first premise is that the cookies must be in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
