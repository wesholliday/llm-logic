Fido is not in the garden.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know there are only two possibilities for Fido's location: inside or in the garden. The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities by asserting that Fido is not in the garden.\n\nGiven that the only other option presented in the first statement is that Fido is inside, and since the second statement rules out the garden as a possibility, the only remaining logical conclusion is that Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
