It is also stated that the missing sock is not under the bed. \n\nGiven these two premises:\n1. The missing sock is either in the laundry basket or under the bed.\n2. The missing sock is not under the bed.\n\nWe can use the process of elimination. Since the missing sock is not under the bed, and those were the only two options provided, the only remaining possibility is that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
