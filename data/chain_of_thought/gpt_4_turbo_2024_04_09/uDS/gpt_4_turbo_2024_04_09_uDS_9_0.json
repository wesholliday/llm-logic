This is a logical disjunction (either A or B).\n\nThe statement also asserts that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor. This eliminates one of the possibilities presented in the disjunction.\n\nGiven that the two initial possibilities are exhaustive (the piece must be either in one place or the other), and one of these possibilities (blending in on the floor) has been negated, the only remaining possibility under the conditions provided is that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
