The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen.\n\nFrom statement 1, we have two possibilities: the phone is either in the living room or it is ringing in the kitchen. This is a logical disjunction (an \"or\" statement), where if one of the conditions is true, the statement is satisfied.\n\nStatement 2 tells us that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen. Since this condition is false, the only remaining possibility for the truth of statement 1 is that the phone is in the living room.\n\nTherefore, since the condition of the phone ringing in the kitchen is false, and given the disjunction in statement 1, the only way for the statement to hold true is if the phone is indeed in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes",
