It is also stated that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet. This eliminates the possibility of the keys being in the cabinet.\n\nGiven that the keys must be in one of the two locations mentioned (drawer or cabinet), and the option of the cabinet is ruled out, the only remaining possibility is that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
