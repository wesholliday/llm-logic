This is a logical disjunction (either/or scenario). \n\nThe additional information provided is that the scarf is not draped on the coat rack. \n\nGiven that the scarf must be in one of the two locations mentioned (backpack or coat rack), and it has been established that it is not on the coat rack, the only remaining possibility is that the scarf is in the backpack.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given and using logical deduction, we can infer that the scarf must be stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
