Given these two premises, if the toy is not on the shelf, the only remaining possibility from the initial options provided is that the toy must be in the toy box. This is a straightforward application of disjunctive syllogism, a form of logical reasoning where if one disjunct (the toy is on the shelf) is false, the other disjunct (the toy is in the toy box) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
