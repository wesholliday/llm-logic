It is also stated that the umbrella is not in the closet. Given these two premises, we can use the process of elimination to determine the location of the umbrella.\n\n1. The first premise states: \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it is tucked away in the closet.\"\n2. The second premise states: \"The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet.\"\n\nFrom the second premise, we know the umbrella is not in the closet. Therefore, the only remaining possibility from the first premise is that the umbrella is in the car. Since the two premises logically lead to this conclusion, we can infer that the umbrella must indeed be in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
