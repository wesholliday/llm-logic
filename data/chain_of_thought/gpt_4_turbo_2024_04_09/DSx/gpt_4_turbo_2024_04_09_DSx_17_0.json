The conditions are:\n- The flob is skizzled.\n- The flob is movated.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the condition \"The flob is movated\" is false.\n\nSince in a disjunction (either/or statement) at least one of the conditions must be true, and we know that \"The flob is movated\" is false, the only remaining possibility for the disjunction to hold true is that \"The flob is skizzled\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The flob is skizzled\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
