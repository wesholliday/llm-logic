            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use logical reasoning:\n\n1. We start with the statement: \"Either the shank is plooked or it is nugged.\" This is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the conditions must be true. In logical terms, this can be written as P \u2228 N, where P represents \"the shank is plooked\" and N represents \"the shank is nugged.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The shank is not nugged.\" This is a negation of N. In logical terms, this can be written as \u00acN.\n\n3. To find out if \"The shank is plooked\" must be true, we combine these two statements. From P \u2228 N (either P or N is true) and \u00acN (N is not true), we apply the rule of disjunctive syllogism. This rule states that if P \u2228 N is true and N is false, then P must be true.\n\n4. Therefore, from P \u2228 N and \u00acN, we can infer P, which means \"The shank is plooked\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
