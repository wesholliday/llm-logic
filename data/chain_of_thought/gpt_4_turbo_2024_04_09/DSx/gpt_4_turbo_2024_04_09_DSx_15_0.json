It asserts that at least one of the following must be true: \"the dreb is vroombed\" or \"the dreb is spened.\"\n\nThe second statement negates one of the disjuncts: it asserts that \"the dreb is not spened.\"\n\nAccording to the rules of disjunction in logic, if a disjunction (A or B) is true, and one of its disjuncts (B) is shown to be false, then the other disjunct (A) must be true to satisfy the truth of the disjunction.\n\nApplying this to the given statements:\n- From statement 1, we know \"the dreb is vroombed or the dreb is spened\" must be true.\n- From statement 2, we know \"the dreb is not spened\" is true.\n\nSince \"the dreb is spened\" is false, the only way for the disjunction in statement 1 to hold true is if \"the dreb is vroombed\" is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"the dreb is vroombed\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
