The wug is not garpled. (This can be represented as: not G)\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that one of the two conditions must be true: either the wug is sproinged (S) or it is garpled (G). Since statement 2 tells us that the wug is not garpled (not G), we can conclude that the only remaining possibility from statement 1 must be true: the wug is sproinged (S).\n\nThus, from the information given, we can logically infer that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
