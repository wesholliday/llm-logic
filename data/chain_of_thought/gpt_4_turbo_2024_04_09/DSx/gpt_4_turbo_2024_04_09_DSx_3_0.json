            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use logical reasoning. We start by analyzing the given statements:\n\n1. \"Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked.\"\n2. \"The splat is not quanked.\"\n\nThe first statement is a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario). It states that one of the two conditions must be true: either the splat is morphed, or the splat is quanked.\n\nThe second statement directly negates one of the conditions of the disjunction: it states that the splat is not quanked.\n\nGiven that in a disjunction (A or B), if B is false, then A must be true to satisfy the condition of the disjunction. Here, since the statement that the splat is quanked (B) is false, the only remaining possibility for the disjunction to hold true is that the splat is morphed (A).\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
