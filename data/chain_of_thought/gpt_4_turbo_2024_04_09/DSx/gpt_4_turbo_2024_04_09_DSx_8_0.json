            "content": "To solve this, we can analyze the logical structure of the statements given:\n\n1. \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it is daggled.\" This statement is a logical disjunction (an \"or\" statement). It asserts that at least one of the following conditions must be true: the sprocket is cranked, or the sprocket is daggled.\n\n2. \"The sprocket is not daggled.\" This statement is a negation. It asserts that it is not true that the sprocket is daggled.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use the rule of disjunctive syllogism in logic, which says that if \"A or B\" is true and \"A\" is false, then \"B\" must be true. Applying this to the given statements:\n- \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it is daggled\" (A or B)\n- \"The sprocket is not daggled\" (not B)\n\nSince we know that \"not B\" is true (the sprocket is not daggled), we can conclude that \"A\" must be true (the sprocket is cranked).\n\nAnswer: yes",
