Since the statement \"the fribble is crinked\" is false (as per the second statement), the only remaining possibility that satisfies the first statement is that \"the fribble is snurgled\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that the fribble is indeed snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
