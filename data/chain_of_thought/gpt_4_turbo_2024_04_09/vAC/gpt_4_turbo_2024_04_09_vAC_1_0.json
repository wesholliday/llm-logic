            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument structure is as follows:\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. (Premise)\n2. Sue was at the wedding. (Premise)\n3. Therefore, Mary was at the wedding. (Conclusion)\n\nThis argument form is attempting to use a logical inference known as modus ponens, but it incorrectly applies it. Modus ponens would correctly be:\n- If P, then Q.\n- P.\n- Therefore, Q.\n\nHowever, the argument given is:\n- If P, then Q.\n- Q.\n- Therefore, P.\n\nThis is a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. The truth of the consequent (Sue was at the wedding) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding). It is possible that Sue could be at the wedding without Mary being there, as the first premise only states that if Mary is there, then Sue will be there; it does not state that Sue being there necessarily means Mary must be there.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
