If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. (If P then Q)\n2. The mummy was awake. (Q)\n3. Therefore, the vampire was awake. (P)\n\nThis argument is an example of affirming the consequent, a common logical fallacy. The fallacy occurs because the truth of the consequent (Q) does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent (P). In other words, just because the mummy was awake, it does not logically follow that the vampire must have been awake. There could be other reasons why the mummy was awake that do not involve the vampire being awake.\n\nThus, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises, making the argument logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: no",
