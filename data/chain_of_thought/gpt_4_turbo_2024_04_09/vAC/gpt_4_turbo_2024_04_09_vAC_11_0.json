If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. (If P, then Q)\n2. The muffins were blueberry. (Q)\n3. Therefore, the cake was chocolate. (P)\n\nThis argument form is known as affirming the consequent. It is a common logical fallacy. The fallacy occurs because the truth of the consequent (Q) does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent (P). In other words, just because the consequent condition (the muffins were blueberry) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent condition (the cake was chocolate) must also be true. There could be other reasons why the muffins were blueberry that do not involve the cake being chocolate.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises, making the argument form invalid.\n\nAnswer: no",
