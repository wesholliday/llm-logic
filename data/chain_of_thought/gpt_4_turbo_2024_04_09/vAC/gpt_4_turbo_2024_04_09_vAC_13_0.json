If the car was red, then the truck was blue. (If P then Q)\n2. The truck was blue. (Q)\n3. Therefore, the car was red. (P)\n\nThis argument form is known as affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. The fallacy occurs because the truth of the consequent (Q) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (P). In other words, just because the truck being blue (Q) is true, it does not logically follow that the car being red (P) must also be true. There could be other reasons why the truck is blue that do not involve the car being red.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
