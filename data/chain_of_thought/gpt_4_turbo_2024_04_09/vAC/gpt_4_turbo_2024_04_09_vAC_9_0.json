If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. (If P then Q)\n2. Mark bought the blue shirt. (Q)\n3. Therefore, Lisa bought the red shirt. (P)\n\nThis argument form is known as affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. The fallacy occurs because the truth of the consequent (Q) does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent (P). In other words, just because the consequent (Mark bought the blue shirt) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt) must also be true. There could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt that are unrelated to whether Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that Lisa bought the red shirt does not necessarily follow from the premises provided, making the argument invalid.\n\nAnswer: no",
