If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. (If P, then Q)\n2. Erin took a train. (Q)\n3. Therefore, Sam took a plane. (P)\n\nThis argument is an example of affirming the consequent, a common logical fallacy. The fallacy occurs because the truth of the consequent (Q) does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent (P). In other words, just because the consequent (Erin took a train) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (Sam took a plane) must also be true. Erin could have taken a train for reasons unrelated to whether Sam took a plane.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises, making the argument logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: no",
