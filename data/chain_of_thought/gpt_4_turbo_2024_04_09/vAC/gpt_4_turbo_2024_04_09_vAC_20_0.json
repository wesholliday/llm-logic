If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. (If A, then B)\n2. The banana was yellow. (B)\n3. Therefore, the apple was red. (A)\n\nThis argument form is known as affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. The fallacy occurs because the truth of the consequent (B) does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent (A). In other words, just because the banana was yellow, it does not necessarily mean that the apple was red; the banana could be yellow for reasons unrelated to the color of the apple.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
