If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. (If P then Q)\n2. The pants were denim. (Q)\n3. Therefore, the shirt was cotton. (P)\n\nThis argument form is known as affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. The fallacy occurs because even though the consequent (Q) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (P) must be true. There could be other reasons why the pants were denim that do not involve the shirt being cotton.\n\nIn logical terms, just because Q is true, we cannot conclude P is true solely based on this information. The truth of Q does not depend solely on P being true; other conditions could also make Q true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
