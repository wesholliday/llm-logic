            "content": "The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement. It can be symbolically represented as \\( M \\rightarrow S \\), where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe truth of the conditional statement \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) means that if \\( M \\) is true, then \\( S \\) must be true. However, it does not necessarily mean that if \\( S \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must be true. The truth of \\( S \\) (Sue was at the wedding) does not logically require \\( M \\) (Mary was at the wedding) to also be true. The statement \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) only specifies what happens if \\( M \\) is true, not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, knowing that \"Sue was at the wedding\" is true does not provide enough information to conclude that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is also true. Mary could have been at the wedding or not; the given statements do not provide enough information to determine her presence.\n\nAnswer: no",
