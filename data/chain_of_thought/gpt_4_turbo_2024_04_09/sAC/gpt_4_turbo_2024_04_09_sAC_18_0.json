This is because the truth of Q (the truck was metal) could be caused by factors other than P (the doll being plastic). The truth of Q does not depend solely on the truth of P.\n\nThis logical fallacy is known as \"affirming the consequent.\" It occurs when one assumes that because the consequent (Q) is true, the antecedent (P) must also be true, which is not valid reasoning in logic.\n\nTherefore, from the statements provided, we cannot conclude that \"The doll was plastic\" just because \"The truck was metal\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
