Either the milk is chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter.\n\nThe first statement clearly asserts that the milk is not in the fridge. The second statement presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario): the milk is either in the fridge or on the counter.\n\nGiven that the first statement negates the possibility of the milk being in the fridge, the only remaining possibility presented by the disjunction in the second statement is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nTherefore, based on these statements, we can logically infer that the milk must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
