The second statement presents a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where the two possibilities are:\n- The pen is on my desk.\n- The pen is in my bag.\n\nSince the first part of the disjunction (\"The pen is on my desk\") is false, as stated in the first sentence, the rules of logical disjunction dictate that the other part of the statement must be true for the overall statement to hold. Therefore, if the pen is not on the desk, it must be in the bag, according to the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
