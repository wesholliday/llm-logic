Since we know from statement 1 that the first part of this disjunction (the phone is ringing in the kitchen) is false, the rules of logic dictate that the other part of the disjunction must be true for the overall statement to hold true.\n\nTherefore, since the phone is not ringing in the kitchen, it must be true that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes",
