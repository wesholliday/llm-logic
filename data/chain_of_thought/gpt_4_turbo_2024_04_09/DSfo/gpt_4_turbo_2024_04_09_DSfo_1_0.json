Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the condition of Fido being in the garden is false. \n\nStatement 2 presents a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where at least one of the conditions must be true. Since we know from statement 1 that the condition \"Fido is in the garden\" is false, the only remaining possibility within the disjunction for the statement to hold true is that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nTherefore, given that \"Fido is not in the garden\" is true, and that \"Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside\" must also be true, the only logical conclusion is that Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
