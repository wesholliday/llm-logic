Analyze the first statement: \"The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor.\" This statement clearly indicates that the puzzle piece is not on the floor, or at least not blending in with it.\n\n2. Consider the second statement: \"Either the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\" This is a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" statement), which means that at least one of the conditions must be true.\n\n3. Since the first part of the disjunction (\"the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor\") is false based on the first statement, the rules of disjunction imply that the other part of the statement must be true for the overall disjunction to hold.\n\n4. Therefore, since the puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, it must be true that \"the missing puzzle piece is in the box\" to satisfy the disjunction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
