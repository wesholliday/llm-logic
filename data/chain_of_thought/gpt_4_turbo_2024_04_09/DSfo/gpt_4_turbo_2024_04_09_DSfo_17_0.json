The second statement presents a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) between two possibilities:\n- The scarf is draped on the coat rack.\n- The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nSince the first part of the disjunction (the scarf is draped on the coat rack) is false, as stated in the first statement, the structure of the disjunction (\"either/or\") forces the second part to be true in order to satisfy the overall truth of the statement. Therefore, if the scarf is not on the coat rack, it must be in the backpack, according to the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
