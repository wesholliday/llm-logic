The second statement presents a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where the two possibilities are:\n- The umbrella is tucked away in the closet.\n- The umbrella is in the car.\n\nSince the first part of the disjunction (\"The umbrella is tucked away in the closet\") is false (as per the first statement), the rule of disjunction in logic (where if one part of an \"either/or\" statement is false, the other must be true for the statement to hold) forces the second part to be true.\n\nTherefore, since the umbrella is not in the closet, it must be in the car to satisfy the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
