The second statement presents a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where two possibilities are given:\n- The book is resting on the table.\n- The book is on the shelf.\n\nSince the first part of the disjunction (\"The book is resting on the table\") is false (as per the first statement), the rules of logical disjunction dictate that the other part of the disjunction must be true for the overall statement to hold. Therefore, since the book is not on the table, it must be on the shelf to satisfy the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
