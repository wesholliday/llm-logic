Either the cookies are hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar.\n\nThe first statement clearly tells us that the cookies are not in the pantry. The second statement presents a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where the two possibilities are:\n- The cookies are hidden in the pantry.\n- The cookies are in the jar.\n\nSince the first part of the disjunction (the cookies are hidden in the pantry) is false, as stated in the first sentence, the rules of logic dictate that the other part of the disjunction must be true for the overall statement to hold. Therefore, the cookies must be in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
