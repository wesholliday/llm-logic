The second statement presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where the two possibilities are:\n- The toy is sitting on the shelf.\n- The toy is in the toy box.\n\nSince the first part of the disjunction (the toy is sitting on the shelf) is false, as stated in the first statement, the only remaining possibility within the given disjunction is that the toy is in the toy box. Therefore, based on these statements, we can infer that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
