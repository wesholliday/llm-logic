Either the cat is playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch.\n\nThe first statement clearly indicates that the cat is not playing in the bedroom. The second statement presents a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where two possibilities are given:\n- The cat is playing in the bedroom.\n- The cat is napping on the couch.\n\nSince the first part of the disjunction (the cat is playing in the bedroom) is false, as stated in the first sentence, the rules of logical disjunction dictate that the other part of the statement must be true for the overall statement to hold. Therefore, since it is not true that the cat is playing in the bedroom, it must be true that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
