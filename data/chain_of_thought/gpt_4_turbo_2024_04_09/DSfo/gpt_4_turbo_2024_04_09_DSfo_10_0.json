The second statement presents a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where the two possibilities are:\n- The missing sock is under the bed.\n- The missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nSince the first part of the disjunction (the missing sock is under the bed) is declared false by the first statement, the rules of logic dictate that the other part of the disjunction must be true for the overall statement to hold. Therefore, if the sock isn't under the bed, it must be in the laundry basket, according to the second statement.\n\nThus, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes",
