The second statement presents a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where there are only two possibilities for the location of the sunglasses: either on her head or in her bag.\n\nSince the first statement negates the possibility of the sunglasses being on her head, the only remaining option from the second statement is that the sunglasses must be in her bag. This is because in a logical disjunction (A or B), if A is false, then B must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical deduction:\n\nAnswer: yes",
