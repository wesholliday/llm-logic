The second statement presents a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where there are only two possibilities for the location of the watch: it is either on his wrist or charging on the dresser.\n\nGiven that the first statement negates the possibility of the watch being on his wrist, the only remaining option from the second statement is that the watch must be charging on the dresser. This is because in a logical disjunction (A or B), if A is false, then B must be true.\n\nTherefore, from the information provided, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
