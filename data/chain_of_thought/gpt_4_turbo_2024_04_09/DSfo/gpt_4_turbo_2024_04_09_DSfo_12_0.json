The second statement presents a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where there are only two possibilities for the location of the jacket: it is either hanging in the closet or draped over the chair.\n\nSince the first statement negates the possibility of the jacket being in the closet, the only remaining option from the second statement is that the jacket must be draped over the chair. This is a straightforward application of the rule of disjunction elimination in logic, where if one disjunct (one part of an \"either/or\" statement) is false, the other must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
