Either the newspaper is sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway.\n\nThe first statement clearly indicates that the newspaper is not on the porch. The second statement presents a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where the two possibilities are:\n- The newspaper is sitting on the porch.\n- The newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nSince the first part of the disjunction (the newspaper is sitting on the porch) is false, as stated in the first statement, the rules of disjunction in logic dictate that if one part of an \"either/or\" statement is false, the other must be true for the statement to hold overall.\n\nTherefore, since it is not true that the newspaper is on the porch, and given the disjunction states it must either be on the porch or in the driveway, it must be true that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes",
