The truth table for a conditional statement (if P then Q) tells us that such a statement is true in all cases except where P is true and Q is false. Since we know P is false, the truth value of Q (the whiffle tinked) does not affect the truth of the conditional statement. \n\nIn other words, whether the whiffle tinked or not is independent of the truth of the conditional statement when P is false. Therefore, from the information given, we cannot determine the truth value of Q (whether the whiffle tinked or not) based solely on the falsity of P (the whiffle was not shanked).\n\nThus, we cannot infer that \"The whiffle did not tink\" based solely on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
