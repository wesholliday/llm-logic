The truth table for a conditional statement (if P then Q) tells us that the statement is true if P is false, regardless of the truth value of Q. This means that whether Q (it surned) is true or false does not affect the truth of the conditional statement when P is false.\n\nTherefore, from the information given, we cannot determine the truth value of Q (the fleeg surned) based solely on the falsity of P (the fleeg was bluttered). It is possible that the fleeg surned due to some other reason not mentioned, or it did not surn at all.\n\nThus, we cannot infer that \"The fleeg did not surn\" based solely on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
