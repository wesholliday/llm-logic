In logic, a conditional statement \\( V \\rightarrow P \\) is true whenever the antecedent (\\( V \\)) is false, regardless of the truth value of the consequent (\\( P \\)). This is because a conditional statement is only false when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false.\n\nGiven that \\( V \\) is false, the conditional statement \\( V \\rightarrow P \\) is true regardless of whether \\( P \\) is true or false. Therefore, we cannot determine the truth value of \\( P \\) based solely on these statements. It could be either true or false without affecting the truth of the conditional statement.\n\nThus, from the statements provided, we cannot infer that \"The smonk was not plagged.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
