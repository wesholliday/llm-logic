According to the rules of logic, specifically the truth table for a conditional statement, if the antecedent (P) is false, the conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is true regardless of the truth value of the consequent (Q). This means that the truth of Q (the sneg sproted the frink) is not determined solely by this conditional statement when P is false.\n\nSince we do not have additional information about Q when P is false, we cannot conclude that Q is false. Q could be true or false independently of P in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, from the statements provided, we cannot infer that \"The sneg did not sprot the frink.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
