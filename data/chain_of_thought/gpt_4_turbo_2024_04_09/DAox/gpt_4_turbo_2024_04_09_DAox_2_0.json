We know from statement 1 that P is false.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If P then Q\" is considered true if P is false, regardless of the truth value of Q. This is because a conditional statement is only false if P is true and Q is false.\n\nSince we know P is false (the wug did not floop), the conditional statement \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint\" is true regardless of whether the wug bimmed the zoint or not. Therefore, we cannot determine the truth value of Q (the wug bimmed the zoint) based solely on the information given.\n\nThus, from the statements provided, we cannot infer whether \"The wug did not bim the zoint\" is true or false.\n\nAnswer: no",
