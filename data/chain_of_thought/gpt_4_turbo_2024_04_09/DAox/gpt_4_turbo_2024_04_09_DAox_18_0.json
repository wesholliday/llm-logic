The second statement is a conditional: \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\"\n\nWe need to determine if these statements allow us to infer \"The shank was not nugged.\"\n\nUsing the conditional statement, we know that being \"plooked\" is a sufficient condition for being \"nugged.\" This means that if the shank is plooked, it must be nugged. However, the converse is not necessarily true; not being plooked does not automatically mean not being nugged, unless it is stated that being plooked is also a necessary condition for being nugged.\n\nSince the first statement confirms that the shank was not plooked, we only know that the condition for being nugged (being plooked) was not met. However, without additional information that being plooked is the only way the shank could be nugged, we cannot conclude that the shank was not nugged. There might be other conditions (not mentioned) under which the shank could still be nugged.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that \"The shank was not nugged\" solely from the statement \"The shank was not plooked\" and the conditional \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
