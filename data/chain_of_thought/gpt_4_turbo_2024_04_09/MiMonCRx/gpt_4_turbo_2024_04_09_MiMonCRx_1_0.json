            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The flibbit might be zorped and gribbled\" suggests the possibility that the flibbit could be both zorped and gribbled simultaneously. This implies that each condition (being zorped and being gribbled) is individually possible. Therefore, if it is possible that the flibbit might be both zorped and gribbled, it is also possible that the flibbit might be gribbled, independent of being zorped. The statement about the possibility of both conditions does not negate the possibility of either condition occurring on its own.\n\nAnswer: yes",
