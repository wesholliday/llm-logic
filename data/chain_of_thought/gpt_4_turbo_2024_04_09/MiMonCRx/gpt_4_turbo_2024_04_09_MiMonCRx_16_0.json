            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The snorkel might be zibbed and flumped\" suggests the possibility of two conditions being true simultaneously: the snorkel being \"zibbed\" and the snorkel being \"flumped.\" Since the statement indicates that both conditions might occur together, it inherently implies that each individual condition might also occur. Therefore, if it is possible that the snorkel might be both \"zibbed\" and \"flumped,\" it is also possible, within the scope of this statement, that the snorkel might be \"flumped\" independently of being \"zibbed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
