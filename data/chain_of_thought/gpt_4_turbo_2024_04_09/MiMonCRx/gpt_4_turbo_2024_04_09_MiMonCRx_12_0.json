            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The zibble might be frobbed and quorked\" suggests the possibility that both actions (frobbed and quorked) could occur to the zibble. The use of \"and\" in this context implies that both events are possible together. If it is stated that both events might occur together, it inherently means that each event individually might also occur. Therefore, from the statement that the zibble might be frobbed and quorked, it logically follows that the zibble might be quorked, as this is part of the combined possibilities mentioned.\n\nAnswer: yes",
