            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The froodle might be wozzled and crunked\" suggests the possibility that the froodle is both wozzled and crunked. The use of \"and\" in this context implies that both conditions (wozzled and crunked) could simultaneously apply to the froodle. Therefore, if it is possible that the froodle is both wozzled and crunked, it is also possible that the froodle is crunked on its own. The statement about the possibility of both conditions inherently includes the possibility of each condition individually.\n\nAnswer: yes",
