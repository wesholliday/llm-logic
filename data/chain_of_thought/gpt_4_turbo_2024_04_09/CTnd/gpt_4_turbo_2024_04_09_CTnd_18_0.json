            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"the issue was discussed\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"the issue was discussed in depth\".\n\n2. We need to determine if the following statement can be inferred: \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\n3. To see if \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), we need to understand the logical relationship:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) states that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be false. This means that discussing the issue implies it was not discussed in depth.\n   - \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) states that if \\( Q \\) is true, then \\( P \\) must be false. This means that discussing the issue in depth implies it was not discussed at all.\n\n4. Analyzing the logical relationship:\n   - If \\( P \\) is true (the issue was discussed), \\( \\neg Q \\) must be true (it was not discussed in depth). This is consistent with the original statement.\n   - However, if \\( Q \\) is true (the issue was discussed in depth), does it necessarily mean \\( P \\) is false (the issue was not discussed)? No, because discussing the issue in depth is a form of discussing the issue. Therefore, \\( Q \\) being true does not imply \\( \\neg P \\); rather, it contradicts \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - The statement \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) (If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed) cannot be logically inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) (If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth) because discussing in depth is a subset of discussing, not a contradiction of it.\n\nAnswer: no",
