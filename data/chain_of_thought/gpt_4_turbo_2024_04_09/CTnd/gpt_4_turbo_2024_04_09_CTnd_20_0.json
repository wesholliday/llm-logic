            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is: \"If a recommendation was made, then it was not a strong recommendation.\" In logical terms, this can be written as:\n   \\( R \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n   where \\( R \\) represents \"a recommendation was made\" and \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"it was not a strong recommendation.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if this implies the second statement: \"If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg R \\)\n\n3. To see if \\( R \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) implies \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg R \\), we can use the concept of contraposition in logic. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \\( R \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is:\n   \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg R \\)\n\n4. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, \\( R \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) does indeed imply \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg R \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
