            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the given statement and the statement we are asked to infer.\n\n1. The given statement is: \"If Ann exercised, then she did not exercise strenously.\" In logical form, this can be written as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"Ann exercised\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"Ann exercised strenuously.\"\n\n2. The statement we need to infer is: \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise.\" In logical form, this is:\n   \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\n3. To determine if the inference is valid, we need to check if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) logically implies \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\n4. Using the truth table method or logical reasoning:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) means whenever \\( P \\) is true, \\( Q \\) must be false. This is because \\( P \\) being true leads to \\( \\neg Q \\) (not \\( Q \\)).\n   - Now, if \\( Q \\) (Ann exercised strenuously) is true, then \\( P \\) (Ann exercised) must be false for \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) to hold. However, this contradicts the common understanding that exercising strenuously is a form of exercising. If Ann did indeed exercise strenuously, it implies she exercised, not the opposite.\n\n5. Therefore, \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) does not imply \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) because the truth of \\( Q \\) (exercising strenuously) inherently means \\( P \\) (exercising) is true, not false.\n\nAnswer: no",
