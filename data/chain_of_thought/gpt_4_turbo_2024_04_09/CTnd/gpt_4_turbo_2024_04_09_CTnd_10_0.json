            "content": "To analyze the inference, let's break down the statements:\n\n1. \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice.\"\n   - This can be represented as: If A (advice was offered), then not H (it was not helpful).\n\n2. \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered.\"\n   - This can be represented as: If H and A, then not A.\n\nNow, let's examine the logical relationship between these two statements:\n\n- The first statement (If A, then not H) implies that whenever advice is offered, it is never helpful. In logical terms, this means that the occurrence of A (advice being offered) guarantees the non-occurrence of H (helpful advice).\n\n- The second statement (If H and A, then not A) suggests a contradiction, stating that if advice is both helpful and offered, then it was not offered. This is logically impossible because it contradicts the premise that advice was both helpful and offered.\n\nTo determine if the first statement implies the second, consider the following:\n- From the first statement, we know that if advice is offered, it cannot be helpful. Therefore, the condition where both helpful advice is offered (H and A) cannot occur. Since this condition (H and A) is impossible under the first statement, the second statement (If H and A, then not A) is vacuously true because its premise (H and A) can never be true.\n\nThus, the first statement does imply the second statement, because the scenario described by the second statement (helpful advice being offered) cannot occur under the conditions set by the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
