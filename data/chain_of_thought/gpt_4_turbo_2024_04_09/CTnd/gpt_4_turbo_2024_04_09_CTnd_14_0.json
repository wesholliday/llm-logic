            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the given statement and see if the proposed inference holds.\n\n1. The given statement is: \"If the meal was prepared, then it was not prepared carefully.\" In logical terms, this can be written as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"the meal was prepared\" and \\( \\neg C \\) represents \"the meal was not prepared carefully.\"\n\n2. The statement we need to infer is: \"If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\n3. To determine if \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) follows from \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg C \\), we need to understand the relationship between \\( P \\) and \\( C \\). The original statement \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) indicates that if the meal is prepared (\\( P \\)), it necessarily follows that it is not prepared carefully (\\( \\neg C \\)). \n\n4. The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) is \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) is true, then \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\n5. Since the contrapositive \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is equivalent to the original statement \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg C \\), we can conclude that the inference \"If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared\" is valid based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
