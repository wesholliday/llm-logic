            "content": "To solve this, let's analyze the given statement and its logical implications:\n\n1. The given statement is: \"If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly.\"\n   - Let's denote:\n     - \\( T \\) = The room was tidied.\n     - \\( \\neg T \\) = The room was not tidied.\n     - \\( TT \\) = The room was tidied thoroughly.\n     - \\( \\neg TT \\) = The room was not tidied thoroughly.\n\n   - The statement can be written in logical form as:\n     - \\( T \\implies \\neg TT \\)\n\n2. We need to determine if this implies: \"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as:\n     - \\( TT \\implies \\neg T \\)\n\n3. Analyzing the implication:\n   - \\( T \\implies \\neg TT \\) means that if the room was tidied at all, it definitely was not tidied thoroughly. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the room was tidied thoroughly, it wasn't tidied at all. In fact, logically, tidying thoroughly (\\( TT \\)) is a stronger condition than just tidying (\\( T \\)), and typically \\( TT \\) would imply \\( T \\) (if you tidied thoroughly, you certainly tidied).\n\n4. Therefore, the statement \\( T \\implies \\neg TT \\) does not logically imply \\( TT \\implies \\neg T \\). The original statement only excludes the possibility of thorough tidying when any tidying is done, but it does not imply that thorough tidying negates any tidying.\n\nAnswer: no",
