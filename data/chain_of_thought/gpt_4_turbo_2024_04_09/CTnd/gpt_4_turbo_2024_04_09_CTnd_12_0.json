The given statement is: \"If Jane studied, then she did not study long.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) represents \"Jane studied\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) represents \"Jane did not study long.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If Jane studied long, then she did not study.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\n3. To see if \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), we need to understand the relationship between \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\):\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) means that if \\( P \\) is true (Jane studied), then \\( Q \\) must be false (Jane did not study long).\n   - However, this does not necessarily imply anything about the situation when \\( Q \\) is true (Jane studied long). Specifically, it does not provide information about whether \\( P \\) (Jane studied) is true or false when \\( Q \\) is true.\n\n4. Consider a scenario where both \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) are false (Jane did not study and Jane did not study long). This scenario does not contradict the original statement \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) because the original statement only specifies a condition when \\( P \\) is true.\n\n5. Now, if \\( Q \\) (Jane studied long) is true, we do not have information from the original statement about the truth value of \\( P \\) (Jane studied). It is possible that Jane studied but not long, or Jane studied long, which means she studied. Therefore, \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) (If Jane studied long, then she did not study) is not necessarily true.\n\nFrom this analysis, we conclude that the statement \"If Jane studied long, then she did not study\" cannot be logically inferred from \"If Jane studied, then she did not study long.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
