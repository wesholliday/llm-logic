We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed.\"\n   - This would be written as: If B, then not A.\n\nFrom the first statement (If A, then not B), we know that whenever the issue is addressed (A is true), it is not addressed effectively (B is false). \n\nNow, let's consider the second statement we need to infer (If B, then not A). This statement claims that if the issue is addressed effectively (B is true), then it must not have been addressed (A is false). However, this doesn't logically follow from the first statement. The first statement only tells us about the scenario when the issue is addressed, not about when it is addressed effectively. \n\nIn fact, the first statement does not provide any information about what happens when the issue is addressed effectively (B is true); it only tells us about when the issue is addressed (A is true). Therefore, we cannot infer that if the issue is addressed effectively, it was not addressed, because the first statement does not rule out the possibility of the issue being both addressed and addressed effectively (even though it states this does not happen, it does not provide the converse that effective addressing implies non-addressing).\n\nAnswer: no",
