            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If directions were provided, then they were not explained clearly.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"directions were provided\" and \\( \\neg C \\) represents \"directions were not explained clearly.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if this implies: \"If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\n3. To see if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) implies \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), we can use the contrapositive. The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) is:\n   \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   This is because the contrapositive of an implication \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\), which is logically equivalent to the original implication.\n\n4. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the statement it derives from, \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) does indeed imply \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
