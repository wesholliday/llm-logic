            "content": "To analyze the given statements, we need to understand the logical relationship between them.\n\n1. The first statement is: \"If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"Ben studied\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) represents \"Ben did not study diligently.\"\n\n2. The statement we need to infer is: \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   where \\( Q \\) represents \"Ben studied diligently\" and \\( \\neg P \\) represents \"Ben did not study.\"\n\n3. To determine if the inference \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is valid based on \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), we need to check if the truth of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) necessarily implies the truth of \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\n4. Let's analyze the truth table for \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\):\n   - If \\( P \\) is true and \\( Q \\) is true, then \\( \\neg Q \\) is false, making \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) false.\n   - If \\( P \\) is true and \\( Q \\) is false, then \\( \\neg Q \\) is true, making \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) true.\n   - If \\( P \\) is false (irrespective of \\( Q \\)), \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is true because a false antecedent makes the implication true.\n\n5. Now, let's analyze the truth table for \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\):\n   - If \\( Q \\) is true and \\( P \\) is true, then \\( \\neg P \\) is false, making \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) false.\n   - If \\( Q \\) is true and \\( P \\) is false, then \\( \\neg P \\) is true, making \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) true.\n   - If \\( Q \\) is false (irrespective of \\( P \\)), \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is true because a false antecedent makes the implication true.\n\n6. Comparing the truth tables, we see that \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) being true does not necessarily make \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) true. Specifically, when \\( P \\) is true and \\( Q \\) is false, \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is true, but \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is also true (since \\( Q \\) is false). However, if both \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) are true, \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is false, but \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is also false. The critical point is that the truth of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) does not guarantee the truth of \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nTherefore, from \"If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently,\" we cannot infer \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
