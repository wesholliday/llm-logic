            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the given statement and its converse.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables.\" In logical terms, this can be written as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"I went to the store\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"I bought vegetables.\"\n\n2. The statement we need to evaluate is: \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\n3. To determine if \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is a valid inference from \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), we need to understand the relationship between these statements. The statement \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) asserts that if \\( P \\) is true (going to the store), then \\( Q \\) must be false (not buying vegetables). \n\n4. The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). The contrapositive of any statement is logically equivalent to the statement itself. Therefore, if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is true, then its contrapositive \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\n5. Since the contrapositive of the given statement is exactly the statement we are asked to evaluate, we can conclude that if the original statement is true, then the statement \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
