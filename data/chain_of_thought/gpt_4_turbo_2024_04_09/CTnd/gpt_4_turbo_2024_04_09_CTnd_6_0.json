            "content": "To solve this, let's break down the statement and its components:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly.\"\n   - Let's denote:\n     - \\( P \\) as \"the clothes were washed\"\n     - \\( Q \\) as \"the clothes were washed properly\"\n\n   The statement can be written as:\n   - \\( P \\implies \\neg Q \\) (If \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) is false)\n\n2. We need to determine if this implies: \"If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed.\"\n   - This can be written as:\n   - \\( Q \\implies \\neg P \\) (If \\( Q \\) is true, then \\( P \\) is false)\n\n3. To see if \\( P \\implies \\neg Q \\) implies \\( Q \\implies \\neg P \\), we can analyze the truth values:\n   - If \\( P \\) is true (the clothes were washed), \\( Q \\) must be false (the clothes were not washed properly).\n   - If \\( Q \\) is true (the clothes were washed properly), then \\( P \\) must be false (the clothes were not washed) based on the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n4. The contrapositive of \\( P \\implies \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\implies \\neg P \\), which is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nThus, from the statement \"If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly,\" we can indeed infer that \"If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
