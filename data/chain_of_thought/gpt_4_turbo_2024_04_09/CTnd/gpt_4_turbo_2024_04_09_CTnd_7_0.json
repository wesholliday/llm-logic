            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the given statement and its contrapositive.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly.\" In logical form, this can be written as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"the customer was served\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"the customer was served promptly.\"\n\n2. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the contrapositive of our statement is:\n   \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   which translates to \"If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served.\"\n\n3. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nThus, from the statement \"If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly,\" we can indeed infer that \"If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
