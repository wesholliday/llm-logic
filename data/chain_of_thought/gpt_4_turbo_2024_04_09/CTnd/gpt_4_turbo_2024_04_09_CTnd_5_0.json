            "content": "To solve this, let's break down the statement and its components:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly.\"\n   - Let's denote:\n     - P: The room was cleaned.\n     - Q: The room was cleaned thoroughly.\n\n   The statement can be written as: P \u2192 \u00acQ (If P then not Q).\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned.\"\n   - This can be written as: Q \u2192 \u00acP (If Q then not P).\n\n3. To see if we can infer Q \u2192 \u00acP from P \u2192 \u00acQ, let's analyze the logic:\n   - P \u2192 \u00acQ means that whenever the room is cleaned, it is not cleaned thoroughly.\n   - Q \u2192 \u00acP means that if the room is cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned.\n\n4. Consider the implications:\n   - P \u2192 \u00acQ suggests that the occurrence of P (room being cleaned) prevents the occurrence of Q (room being cleaned thoroughly).\n   - Q \u2192 \u00acP suggests that the occurrence of Q (room being cleaned thoroughly) prevents the occurrence of P (room being cleaned).\n\n5. To infer Q \u2192 \u00acP from P \u2192 \u00acQ, we need to establish that the thorough cleaning (Q) logically excludes a general cleaning (P). However, the original statement only asserts that a general cleaning (P) excludes a thorough cleaning (Q), not the other way around.\n\n6. Therefore, without additional information that directly links thorough cleaning (Q) to not being a general cleaning (P), we cannot logically infer Q \u2192 \u00acP from P \u2192 \u00acQ. The original statement does not provide sufficient basis to conclude that a thorough cleaning excludes a general cleaning.\n\nAnswer: no",
