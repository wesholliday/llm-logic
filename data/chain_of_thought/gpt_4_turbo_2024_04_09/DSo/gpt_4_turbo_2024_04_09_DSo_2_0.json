The second statement presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where the book must be in one of two places: either on the shelf or on the table.\n\nGiven that the first statement negates the possibility of the book being on the table, the only remaining option from the second statement is that the book must be on the shelf. This is because in a logical disjunction (A or B), if one part (B) is false, the other part (A) must be true for the statement to hold.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
