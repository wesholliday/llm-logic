Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know the notebook is definitely not on the nightstand. \n\nStatement 2 presents a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario): the notebook is either in the drawer or on the nightstand.\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that the notebook is not on the nightstand, the only remaining possibility from statement 2 is that the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, given the truth of the first statement, the second statement necessarily leads us to conclude that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
