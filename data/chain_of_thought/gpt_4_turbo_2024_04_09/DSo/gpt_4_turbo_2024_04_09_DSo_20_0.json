The second statement presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where the two possibilities for the location of the sunglasses are: they are either in her bag or perched on her head.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the sunglasses are not perched on her head, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nTherefore, from these premises, we can infer that the sunglasses are indeed in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
