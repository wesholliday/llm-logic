The second statement presents a disjunction: the puzzle piece is either in the box or blending in on the floor.\n\nGiven that the first statement negates the possibility of the puzzle piece blending in on the floor, the only remaining option from the disjunction in the second statement is that the puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nTherefore, based on these premises, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece must indeed be in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
