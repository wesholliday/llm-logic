Either the phone is in the living room or it is ringing in the kitchen.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the condition of the phone ringing in the kitchen is false.\n\nStatement 2 presents a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario): either the phone is in the living room, or it is ringing in the kitchen. Since we know from statement 1 that it is not ringing in the kitchen, the only remaining possibility in the disjunction that can be true is that the phone is in the living room.\n\nTherefore, given that one part of the disjunction (ringing in the kitchen) is false, the other part (the phone is in the living room) must be true to satisfy the statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
