Statement 2 presents a disjunction: the watch is either charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist. Since we know from statement 1 that the condition of the watch being on his wrist is false, the only remaining possibility from statement 2 is that the watch is charging on the dresser. \n\nThus, given that one part of the disjunction (the watch is on his wrist) is false, the truth of the disjunction depends on the truth of the other part (the watch is charging on the dresser). Therefore, we can infer that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
