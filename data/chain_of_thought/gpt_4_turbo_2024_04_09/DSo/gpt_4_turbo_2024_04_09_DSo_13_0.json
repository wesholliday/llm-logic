Either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf.\n\nThe first statement clearly indicates that the toy is not on the shelf. The second statement presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where the toy must be in one of two places: either in the toy box or on the shelf.\n\nSince the first statement negates the possibility of the toy being on the shelf, the only remaining option from the second statement is that the toy must be in the toy box. This is because in a logical disjunction (A or B), if one part (B) is false, the other part (A) must be true for the statement to hold.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical deduction:\n\nAnswer: yes",
