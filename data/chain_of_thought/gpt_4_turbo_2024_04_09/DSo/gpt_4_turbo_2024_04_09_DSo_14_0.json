Either the milk is on the counter or it is chilling in the fridge.\n\nThe first statement clearly states that the milk is not chilling in the fridge. The second statement presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario): the milk is either on the counter or it is chilling in the fridge.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the milk is not chilling in the fridge, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the milk must be on the counter. This is because in a disjunction, if one part is false, the other must be true for the statement to hold.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
