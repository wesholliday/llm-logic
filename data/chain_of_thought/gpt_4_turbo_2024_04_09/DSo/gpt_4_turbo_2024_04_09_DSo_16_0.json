The second statement presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where the pen must be in one of two places: either in the bag or on the desk.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the pen is not on the desk, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the pen must be in the bag. This is because in a disjunction, if one part is false, the other must be true for the statement to hold.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
