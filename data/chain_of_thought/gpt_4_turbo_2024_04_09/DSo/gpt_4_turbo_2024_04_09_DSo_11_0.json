Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it is sitting on the porch.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know the newspaper is definitely not on the porch. \n\nStatement 2 presents a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario): the newspaper is either in the driveway or on the porch.\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that the newspaper is not on the porch, the only remaining possibility from the options given in statement 2 is that the newspaper must be in the driveway.\n\nTherefore, based on these premises, we can infer that the newspaper is indeed in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes",
