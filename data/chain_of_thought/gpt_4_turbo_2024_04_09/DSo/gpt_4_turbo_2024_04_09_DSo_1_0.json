The second statement presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where the two possibilities are:\n- Fido is inside.\n- Fido is in the garden.\n\nSince the first statement negates the possibility of Fido being in the garden, the only remaining possibility from the disjunction in the second statement is that Fido is inside.\n\nTherefore, from these statements, we can logically infer that Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
