The second statement presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where the two possibilities are:\n- The umbrella is in the car.\n- The umbrella is tucked away in the closet.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the umbrella is not in the closet, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the umbrella is in the car. Therefore, based on these statements, we can infer that the umbrella must indeed be in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
