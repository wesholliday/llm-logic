The second statement presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where the two possibilities are:\n- The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n- The scarf is draped on the coat rack.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the scarf is not draped on the coat rack, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nTherefore, based on these statements, we can infer that the scarf must be stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
