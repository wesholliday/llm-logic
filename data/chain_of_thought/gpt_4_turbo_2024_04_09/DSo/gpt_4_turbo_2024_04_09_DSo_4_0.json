Either the cat is napping on the couch or it's playing in the bedroom.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the cat is definitely not playing in the bedroom. \n\nThe second statement presents two possibilities: the cat is either napping on the couch or playing in the bedroom. Since we know from the first statement that the cat is not playing in the bedroom, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nTherefore, given that the cat isn't playing in the bedroom, and the only other option provided is that the cat is napping on the couch, we can infer that the cat must be napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
