The second statement presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where the two possibilities are:\n- The remote control is on the coffee table.\n- The remote control is hiding under the couch.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the remote control is not under the couch, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, based on these statements, we can infer that the remote control must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
