The second statement presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where the two possibilities for the location of the missing sock are: it's either in the laundry basket or under the bed.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the sock is not under the bed, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the missing sock must be in the laundry basket. This is because in a disjunction (A or B), if one part (B) is false, the other part (A) must be true for the statement to hold.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
