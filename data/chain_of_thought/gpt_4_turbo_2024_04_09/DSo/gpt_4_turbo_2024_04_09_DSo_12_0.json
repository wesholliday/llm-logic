The second statement presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where the two possibilities are:\n- The jacket is draped over the chair.\n- The jacket is hanging in the closet.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the jacket is not hanging in the closet, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the jacket is draped over the chair. This is because in a disjunction (A or B), if B is false, then A must be true for the statement to hold.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
