The second statement presents a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where the two possibilities are:\n- The keys are in the drawer.\n- The keys are dangling in the cabinet.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the keys are in the drawer. Therefore, based on these statements, we can infer that the keys must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
