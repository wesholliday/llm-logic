According to the rules of logic, specifically the truth table for a conditional statement, if the antecedent (P) is false, the conditional statement (If P then Q) can still be true regardless of the truth value of the consequent (Q). This is because a conditional statement is only false when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false.\n\nSince we only know that the antecedent (P) is false (the shank was not plooked), we cannot determine the truth value of the consequent (Q - the shank was nugged) based solely on this information. The consequent could either be true or false without affecting the truth of the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, from the statements given, we cannot infer that \"The shank was not nugged\" (Not Q) just because \"The shank was not plooked\" (Not P).\n\nAnswer: no",
