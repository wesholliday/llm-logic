According to the rules of logic, specifically the truth table for a conditional statement, if the antecedent (P) is false, the conditional statement (If P then Q) does not specify the truth value of the consequent (Q). The consequent can be either true or false without affecting the truth of the conditional statement. This is because a conditional statement is only false when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false.\n\nTherefore, from \"The splat was not morphed,\" we cannot logically infer that \"The splat did not quank,\" because the truth of the consequent (Q) is independent when the antecedent (P) is false.\n\nAnswer: no",
