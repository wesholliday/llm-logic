However, it does not tell us what happens when P does not happen; Q could either happen or not happen.\n\nSince the second statement tells us that P (the fribble was snurgled) is false, we only know that the condition for Q to definitely happen is not met. However, this does not necessarily mean Q is false; Q could still be true or false independently of P.\n\nTherefore, from the information given, we cannot infer that \"The fribble did not crink\" just because \"The fribble was not snurgled.\" Q (the fribble crinked) could still be true even though P (the fribble was snurgled) is false.\n\nAnswer: no",
