Here, P represents \"the zinger was fraggled\" and Q represents \"the zinger was smoogled.\"\n\nThe second statement tells us that P is false (\"The zinger was not fraggled\").\n\nFrom the structure of conditional logic, if P is false, the conditional statement (If P, then Q) does not specify anything about the truth value of Q. Q could be either true or false regardless of P being false. This is because a conditional statement is only false if P is true and Q is false. In all other cases (including when P is false), the conditional statement is true, but it does not determine the truth value of Q.\n\nTherefore, from the statements given:\n- \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\" (If P, then Q)\n- \"The zinger was not fraggled\" (P is false)\n\nWe cannot infer whether \"The zinger was not smoogled\" (Q is false) is true or not. Q could be either true or false without contradicting any of the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
