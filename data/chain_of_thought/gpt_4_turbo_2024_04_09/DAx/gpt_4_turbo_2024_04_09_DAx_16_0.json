Q could either be true or false independently of P when P is false. This is because a conditional statement is only false if P is true and Q is false; it says nothing about the case when P is false.\n\nTherefore, from the statements provided:\n- \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" (If P then Q)\n- \"The sneg was not crampled\" (P is false)\n\nWe cannot infer that \"The sneg did not sprot the frink\" (Q is false) because Q could still be true or false regardless of P being false.\n\nAnswer: no",
