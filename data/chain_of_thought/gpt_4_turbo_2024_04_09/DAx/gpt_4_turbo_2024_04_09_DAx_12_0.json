Q could either be true or false independently of P when P is false. This is because a conditional statement is only false if P is true and Q is false; it says nothing about the case when P is false.\n\nTherefore, from the statements given:\n- \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint\" (If P then Q)\n- \"The smip was not shripped\" (P is false)\n\nWe cannot infer whether \"The smip lupped the zoint\" (Q) is true or false. Q could still be true or false regardless of P being false.\n\nAnswer: no",
