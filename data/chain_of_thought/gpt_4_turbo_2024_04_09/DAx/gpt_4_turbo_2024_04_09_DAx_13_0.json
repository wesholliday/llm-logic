The original conditional only specifies what happens if P is true, not if P is false.\n\nTherefore, from the information given, we cannot infer that \"The glip was not tragged\" just because \"The glip was not slogged.\" The absence of the condition (slogging) does not necessarily negate the possibility of the consequence (tragging) occurring by some other means or condition not discussed.\n\nAnswer: no",
