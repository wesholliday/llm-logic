This is because a conditional statement is only false if P is true and Q is false.\n\nGiven that P is false (\"The dreb was not vroombed\"), the conditional statement (If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened) is true regardless of whether Q (\"the dreb was spened\") is true or false.\n\nTherefore, from the information given (\"The dreb was not vroombed\"), we cannot definitively conclude whether \"the dreb was spened\" is true or false. The falsity of P does not affect the truth value of Q in a conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
