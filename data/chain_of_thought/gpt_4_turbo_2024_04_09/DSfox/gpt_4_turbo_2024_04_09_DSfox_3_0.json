The second statement presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where either the splat is quanked or it is morphed.\n\nGiven that the first statement negates the possibility of the splat being quanked, the only remaining possibility from the disjunction in the second statement is that the splat is morphed. This is because in a disjunction (A or B), if A is false, then B must be true for the disjunction to hold.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
