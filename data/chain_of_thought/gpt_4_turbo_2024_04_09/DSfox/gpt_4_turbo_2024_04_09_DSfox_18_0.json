Since we know from statement 1 that \"the shank is nugged\" is false, the structure of the disjunction (either/or) forces the other part of the statement to be true to satisfy the overall truth of the disjunction.\n\nTherefore, since \"the shank is nugged\" is false, \"the shank is plooked\" must be true to fulfill the condition set by statement 2.\n\nAnswer: yes",
