The second statement presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where the grommet must be either plopped or sploffed.\n\nGiven that the first statement confirms the grommet is not plopped, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the grommet must be sploffed.\n\nTherefore, from these premises, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes",
