Since we know from statement 1 that \"the flob is not movated\" is true, the only way for the disjunction in statement 2 to hold true is if the other part of the disjunction, \"the flob is skizzled,\" is true.\n\nTherefore, given that \"the flob is not movated\" and \"either the flob is movated or it is skizzled,\" we can logically infer that \"the flob is skizzled\" must be true to satisfy the conditions of the disjunction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
