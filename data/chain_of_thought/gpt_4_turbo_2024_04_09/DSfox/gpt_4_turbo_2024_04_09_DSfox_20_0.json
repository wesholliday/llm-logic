The conditions are:\n   - The fleeg is surned.\n   - The fleeg is bluttered.\n\nSince the first statement tells us that \"The fleeg is not surned\" is true, the condition \"The fleeg is surned\" in the second statement must be false. Therefore, for the disjunction in the second statement to hold true (since a disjunction is true if at least one of its components is true), the other part of the disjunction, \"The fleeg is bluttered,\" must be true.\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
