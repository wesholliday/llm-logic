The second statement presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where either the whiffle is tinked or it is shanked.\n\nGiven that the first statement negates the possibility of the whiffle being tinked, the only remaining possibility from the disjunction in the second statement is that the whiffle is shanked. This is because in a disjunction (A or B), if A is false, then B must be true for the disjunction to hold.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
