The second statement presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where either the wug is bimmed or it is flooped.\n\nGiven that the first statement confirms the wug is not bimmed, and the second statement offers only two possibilities (bimmed or flooped), the fact that the wug is not bimmed eliminates the first option of the disjunction in the second statement. This leaves us with the only remaining possibility from the disjunction: the wug is flooped.\n\nTherefore, from the information provided, we can infer that the wug is flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
