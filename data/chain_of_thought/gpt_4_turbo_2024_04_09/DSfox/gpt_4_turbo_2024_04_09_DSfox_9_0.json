The second statement presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where either the twonk is plinked, or it is varnished.\n\nGiven that the first statement negates the possibility of the twonk being plinked, the structure of the second statement (a logical disjunction) forces us to accept the only remaining possibility for the disjunction to hold true. Since the twonk cannot be plinked (as per the first statement), the only way for the second statement to be true is if the twonk is varnished.\n\nTherefore, from these premises, we can infer that the twonk must be varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
