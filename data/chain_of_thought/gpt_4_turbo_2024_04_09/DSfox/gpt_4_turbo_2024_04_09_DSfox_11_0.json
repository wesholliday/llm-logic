The second statement presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where either the flug is zimmed or it is blummed.\n\nGiven that the first statement negates the possibility of the flug being zimmed, the only remaining possibility from the disjunction in the second statement is that the flug is blummed. This is because in a disjunction (A or B), if A is false, then B must be true for the disjunction to hold.\n\nTherefore, from the information given, we can infer that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
