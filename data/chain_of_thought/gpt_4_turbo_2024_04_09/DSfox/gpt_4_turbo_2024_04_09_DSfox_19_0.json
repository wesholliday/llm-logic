The second statement presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled.\n\nGiven that the first statement confirms the smonk is not plagged, the only remaining possibility in the disjunction (from the second statement) for it to be true is that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nTherefore, since the smonk is not plagged, and the only other option provided by the second statement is that the smonk is vreebled, we can infer that the smonk must be vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
