Either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed.\n\nThe first statement clearly asserts that the flugel is not zargled. The second statement presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed.\n\nGiven that the first statement negates the possibility of the flugel being zargled, the only remaining possibility from the disjunction in the second statement is that the flugel is blimmed. This is because in a disjunction (A or B), if A is false, then B must be true for the disjunction to hold.\n\nTherefore, from the information given, we can infer that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
