(A \u2192 B)\n\n2. \"It might not have been surned.\"\n   This statement suggests the possibility that B is not true. However, it does not assert definitively that B is false; it only opens up the possibility that B might not be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the inference we are asked to evaluate:\n\"Can we infer 'The fleeg was not bluttered'?\"\n\nThis inference would be represented as: Not A.\n\nFrom the logical structure:\n- A \u2192 B (If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned)\n- It might not have been surned (Possibility that Not B)\n\nTo infer Not A (The fleeg was not bluttered) from A \u2192 B, we would need a definitive statement that B is false (Not B). However, the statement \"It might not have been surned\" does not definitively assert Not B; it only suggests that Not B is a possibility.\n\nSince we do not have a definitive Not B, we cannot conclusively infer Not A based on the information given. The possibility that \"It might not have been surned\" does not necessarily mean it was not surned; therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" based solely on the possibility that it might not have been surned.\n\nAnswer: no",
