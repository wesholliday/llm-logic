However, this statement does not confirm that the smip is definitely not lupped; it only opens up the possibility.\n\nThe second statement presents a conditional choice: if the smip is not lupped, then it must be shripped (because one of the two conditions must be true).\n\nHowever, because the first statement does not definitively establish that the smip is not lupped (it only suggests it as a possibility), we cannot conclusively infer from these two statements alone that the smip is definitely shripped. There remains the possibility that the smip could still be lupped.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The smip is shripped\" just from these statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
