However, this statement does not confirm that the fribble is definitely not crinked; it only opens up the possibility.\n\nThe second statement presents a conditional choice: if the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled to satisfy the condition of the disjunction.\n\nHowever, because the first statement does not definitively rule out the fribble being crinked, we cannot conclusively infer from these two statements alone that the fribble must be snurgled. It remains possible that the fribble is crinked, thus not requiring it to be snurgled to satisfy the second statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively infer that \"The fribble is snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
