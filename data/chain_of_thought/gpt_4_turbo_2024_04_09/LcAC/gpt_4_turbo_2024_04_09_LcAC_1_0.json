            "content": "To determine if we can logically conclude that \"Mary was at the wedding\" from the statements \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Sue was at the wedding,\" we need to analyze the logical structure of these statements.\n\n1. The first statement, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" is a conditional statement. It can be represented as: If P, then Q (where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding\").\n\n2. The second statement, \"Sue was at the wedding,\" affirms Q.\n\n3. To determine if we can conclude P (Mary was at the wedding) from these statements, we need to check if the truth of Q (Sue was at the wedding) necessarily implies the truth of P (Mary was at the wedding).\n\n4. The logical form we are examining is known as affirming the consequent. This form states that if Q is true, then P must be true. However, this is a logical fallacy. Just because the consequent (Q) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (P) is true. There could be other reasons why Q is true that do not involve P.\n\n5. In practical terms, just because Sue was at the wedding (Q is true), it does not necessarily mean that Mary was at the wedding (P is true). Sue could have attended the wedding for reasons unrelated to whether Mary attended.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot logically conclude that Mary was at the wedding based solely on the information that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
