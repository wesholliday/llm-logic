            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence states two possibilities: \"the zooble might be in quimble\" and \"the plonk might flimble fribble.\" The sentence you are asking about rephrases these possibilities as \"It might be that the zooble is in quimble and the plonk flimbles fribble.\" This rephrasing maintains the original meaning of each part of the sentence, simply combining them into a single clause introduced by \"It might be that.\" The logical structure and the possibilities expressed remain unchanged. Therefore, the inference preserves the meaning and the possibility condition of each part.\n\nAnswer: yes",
