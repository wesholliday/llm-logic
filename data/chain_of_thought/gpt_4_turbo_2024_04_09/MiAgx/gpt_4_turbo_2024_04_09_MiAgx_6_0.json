            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence states two possibilities: \"the wobble might be flonk zizz\" and \"the flimble might flibbit at zazzle snorkel.\" The sentence you are asking about is a rephrasing of these possibilities into a single statement: \"It might be that the wobble is flonk zizz and the flimble flibbits at zazzle snorkel.\" This rephrased sentence still maintains the possibility of both events occurring, just as in the original. It does not assert that these events definitely happen, but rather that they might happen, which is consistent with the original statement's use of \"might.\" Therefore, the inference maintains the same level of uncertainty and possibility as the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
