            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze whether the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises given.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( M \\rightarrow S \\), where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \"Sue might not have been at the wedding.\" This suggests the possibility that \\( S \\) is false, but does not definitively assert \\( \\neg S \\) (Sue was not at the wedding). It introduces uncertainty about Sue's presence, but does not confirm her absence.\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is \"Mary was not at the wedding,\" symbolically \\( \\neg M \\).\n\nTo test the validity of the argument, we need to see if the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. In logical terms, an argument is valid if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false.\n\n- If \\( M \\) is true (Mary was at the wedding), then \\( S \\) must also be true (Sue was at the wedding) according to the first premise.\n- If \\( M \\) is false (\\(\\neg M\\)), the first premise \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) does not provide any information about \\( S \\). \\( S \\) could be either true or false.\n\nGiven the second premise that \"Sue might not have been at the wedding,\" we acknowledge the possibility of \\( S \\) being false, but it does not confirm \\( S \\) is false. Therefore, we do not have a definitive situation where \\( S \\) is false to test the implication \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) fully.\n\nFor the argument to be valid, the premises together must necessitate \\( \\neg M \\) (Mary was not at the wedding). However, the premises do not rule out the possibility that both Mary and Sue were at the wedding (both \\( M \\) and \\( S \\) being true), which would still satisfy the first premise. Thus, the conclusion \\( \\neg M \\) does not necessarily follow from the premises, especially considering the uncertainty introduced by the second premise about Sue's attendance.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not valid because it is possible for the premises to be true without the conclusion necessarily being true.\n\nAnswer: no",
