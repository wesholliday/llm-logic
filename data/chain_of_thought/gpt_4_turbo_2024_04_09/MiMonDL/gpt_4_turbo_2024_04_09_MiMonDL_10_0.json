            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The computer might be broken\" suggests the possibility that the computer is not functioning correctly. When considering the statement \"The computer might be broken or working,\" it implies that there are two possibilities: either the computer is broken, or it is working. Since the original statement already acknowledges the possibility of the computer being broken, adding the possibility that it might also be working does not contradict or negate the original statement. Instead, it expands the range of possibilities to include everything covered by the original statement. Therefore, if the computer might be broken, it is also logically consistent to say that the computer might be broken or working, as this latter statement simply encompasses a broader spectrum of possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes",
