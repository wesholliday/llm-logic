            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The meeting might be cancelled\" suggests the possibility of the meeting not taking place as originally scheduled. When considering the statement \"The meeting might be cancelled or rescheduled,\" it expands the range of possibilities to include not only cancellation but also the option of changing the meeting to a different time. Since rescheduling is an alternative to cancellation that still alters the original plan, the possibility of cancellation inherently allows for the possibility of other changes to the meeting's scheduling, such as rescheduling. Therefore, if a meeting might be cancelled, it is also true that it might be cancelled or rescheduled, as the latter statement is a superset of the former.\n\nAnswer: yes",
