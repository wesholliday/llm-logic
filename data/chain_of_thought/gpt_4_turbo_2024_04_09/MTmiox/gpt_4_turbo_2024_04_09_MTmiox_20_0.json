This means that if the fleeg was not surned, then it could not have been bluttered.\n\nGiven the first statement, we consider the possibility that the fleeg was not surned. If this possibility is true (that the fleeg was not surned), then according to the second statement, the fleeg could not have been bluttered.\n\nTherefore, from the possibility that the fleeg might not have been surned, we can infer that it is also possible that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: no",
