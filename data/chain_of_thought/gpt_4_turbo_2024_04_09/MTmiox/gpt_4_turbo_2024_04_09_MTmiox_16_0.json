            "content": "To solve this, let's analyze the statements given:\n\n1. \"The sneg might not have sproted the frink\" - This suggests that it is possible that the sneg did not sprot the frink, but it does not confirm that the sneg definitely did not sprot the frink.\n\n2. \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink\" - This is a conditional statement indicating that being crampled is a sufficient condition for the sneg to have sproted the frink.\n\nFrom these statements, we need to determine if we can infer that \"The sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nIf the sneg was crampled, according to statement 2, it must have sproted the frink. However, statement 1 allows for the possibility that the sneg did not sprot the frink. If the sneg did not sprot the frink, then it contradicts the condition that if the sneg was crampled, it must have sproted the frink. Therefore, to avoid contradiction, the sneg must not have been crampled if it did not sprot the frink.\n\nSince statement 1 allows for the possibility that the sneg did not sprot the frink, and statement 2 states that if the sneg was crampled, it must have sproted the frink, we can infer that the sneg was not crampled to maintain consistency between the statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
