Therefore, if the fribble was snurgled, it must have crinked. However, the first statement allows for the possibility that the fribble did not crink. \n\nIf we assume the fribble was snurgled, then by the second statement, it must have crinked, which contradicts the possibility presented in the first statement that the fribble might not have crinked. Therefore, to maintain consistency between the two statements, the assumption that the fribble was snurgled must be false.\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can infer that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
