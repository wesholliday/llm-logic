However, it does not confirm that they definitely are not on her head; it only opens up that possibility.\n\nTo infer that \"The sunglasses are in her bag,\" we would need to establish that the sunglasses definitely are not on her head. Since statement 1 only suggests a possibility and not a certainty, we cannot definitively conclude that the sunglasses are not on her head.\n\nTherefore, without confirmation that the sunglasses are definitely not on her head, we cannot conclusively infer that they must be in her bag based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
