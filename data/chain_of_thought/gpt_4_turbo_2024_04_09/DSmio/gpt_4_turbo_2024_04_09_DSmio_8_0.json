However, it does not confirm that the remote control is definitely not under the couch; it only opens up the possibility.\n\nGiven that statement 1 does not definitively exclude the remote control being under the couch, we cannot conclusively determine that it must be on the coffee table based solely on these statements. Statement 1 would need to assert definitively that the remote control is not under the couch to force the conclusion that it must be on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
