This statement does not confirm the location of the cookies; it only opens up the possibility that they might be somewhere other than the pantry.\n\nStatement 2 presents a conditional choice: the cookies are either in the jar or in the pantry. \n\nIf we accept the possibility from statement 1 that the cookies might not be in the pantry, we then consider the alternative given in statement 2. Since the only other option provided in statement 2 is that the cookies are in the jar, and considering that they might not be in the pantry, it logically follows that the cookies must be in the jar.\n\nThus, combining these statements, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
