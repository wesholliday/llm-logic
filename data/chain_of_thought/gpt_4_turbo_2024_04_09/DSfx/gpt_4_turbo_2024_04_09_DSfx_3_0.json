            "content": "The statement \"Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed\" is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the conditions must be true. This can be represented as: \\( Q \\lor M \\) where \\( Q \\) represents \"the splat is quanked\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the splat is morphed\".\n\nThe additional statement \"The splat is not quanked\" can be represented as \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nUsing the rule of disjunction elimination, if \\( Q \\lor M \\) is true and \\( \\neg Q \\) is also true, then \\( M \\) must be true to satisfy the initial condition of the disjunction. This is because the truth of \\( Q \\lor M \\) requires that at least one of \\( Q \\) or \\( M \\) is true, and if \\( Q \\) is false (\\( \\neg Q \\)), then \\( M \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed\" and \"The splat is not quanked\", we can infer that \"The splat is morphed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
