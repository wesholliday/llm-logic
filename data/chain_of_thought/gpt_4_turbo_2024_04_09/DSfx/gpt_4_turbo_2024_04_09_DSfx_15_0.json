The dreb is not spened.\n\nThe first statement is a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" statement), which means that at least one of the conditions must be true. The second statement negates one of the conditions of the disjunction (that the dreb is not spened).\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, if in a disjunction (A or B) one part (A) is false, then the other part (B) must be true to satisfy the disjunction. Here, since 'The dreb is not spened' negates the first part of the disjunction, the second part ('it is vroombed') must be true to fulfill the condition of the disjunction.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that 'The dreb is vroombed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
