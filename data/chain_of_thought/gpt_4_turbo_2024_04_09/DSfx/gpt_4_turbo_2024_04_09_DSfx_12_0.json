It asserts that at least one of the following must be true:\n- The smip is lupped.\n- The smip is shripped.\n\nThe second statement directly negates one of these possibilities:\n- It asserts that the smip is not lupped.\n\nGiven that the first statement tells us that at least one of the two conditions must be true, and the second statement eliminates the possibility that the smip is lupped, the only remaining possibility under the rules of logic is that the smip is shripped.\n\nTherefore, from these two statements, we can indeed infer that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
