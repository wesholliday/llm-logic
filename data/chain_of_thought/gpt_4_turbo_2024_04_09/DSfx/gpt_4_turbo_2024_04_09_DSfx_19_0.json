It asserts that at least one of the following conditions must be true:\n- The smonk is plagged.\n- The smonk is vreebled.\n\nThe second statement directly negates one of these conditions:\n- The smonk is not plagged.\n\nGiven that a disjunction (either/or) is true if at least one of its components is true, and we know from the second statement that \"The smonk is not plagged\" is true, the only way for the first statement (\"Either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled\") to remain true is if the other component of the disjunction is true. Therefore, \"The smonk is vreebled\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
