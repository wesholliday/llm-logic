It asserts that at least one of the following conditions must be true:\n- The sneg is sproted.\n- The sneg is crampled.\n\nThe second statement directly negates one of these conditions:\n- It asserts that the sneg is not sproted.\n\nGiven that a disjunction (either/or) is true if at least one of its components is true, and we know from the second statement that \"The sneg is not sproted\" is true, the only way for the first statement (\"Either the sneg is sproted or it is crampled\") to remain true is if the other component, \"The sneg is crampled,\" is true.\n\nTherefore, from these two statements, we can logically infer that \"The sneg is crampled\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
