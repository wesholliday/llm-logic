We start with the statement: \"Either the whiffle is tinked or it is shanked.\" This is a logical disjunction, which means at least one of the conditions must be true.\n\n2. We are also given the statement: \"The whiffle is not tinked.\" This tells us that the first part of the disjunction is false.\n\n3. Since in a disjunction (either A or B), if one part (A) is false, the other part (B) must be true to satisfy the condition of the disjunction being true.\n\n4. Therefore, since \"The whiffle is not tinked\" (A is false), \"The whiffle is shanked\" (B) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
