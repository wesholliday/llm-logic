            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given:\n\n1. \"Either the fribble is crinked or it is snurgled.\" This is a logical disjunction (an \"or\" statement). It asserts that at least one of the following conditions must be true: the fribble is crinked, or the fribble is snurgled.\n\n2. \"The fribble is not crinked.\" This statement negates one of the conditions in the disjunction.\n\nGiven these two statements, we apply the rule of disjunctive syllogism. This rule states that if we have a disjunction (A or B) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (not A), then the other must be true (B).\n\nApplying this to the statements:\n- A is \"the fribble is crinked\"\n- B is \"the fribble is snurgled\"\n- We know not A (\"The fribble is not crinked\") is true.\n\nTherefore, by disjunctive syllogism, B (\"the fribble is snurgled\") must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
