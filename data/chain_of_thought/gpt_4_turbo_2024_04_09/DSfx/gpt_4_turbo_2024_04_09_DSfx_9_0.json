If one part of a disjunction is false, the other must be true to satisfy the condition of the disjunction.\n\nStep 4: Since \"The twonk is not plinked\" is true, the only way for the disjunction \"Either the twonk is varnished or it is plinked\" to hold true is if \"The twonk is varnished\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
