It asserts that at least one of the following two conditions must be true:\n- The glip is tragged.\n- The glip is slogged.\n\nThe second statement asserts that:\n- The glip is not tragged.\n\nGiven that the first statement requires that at least one of the two conditions be true, and the second statement rules out the first condition (the glip being tragged), the only remaining possibility that satisfies the first statement is that the second condition must be true. Therefore:\n- The glip must be slogged.\n\nThus, from the statements provided, we can infer that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
