Given the first part of the statement, if one option is false, the other must be true to satisfy the condition.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know the cat is not playing in the bedroom. Therefore, the only remaining option from statement 2 that can be true is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
