Given this, and considering the either-or nature of the second statement, if it is not true that the puzzle piece is blending in on the floor, then the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nTherefore, based on these premises, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is indeed in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
