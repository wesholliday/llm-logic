Given this, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the remote control is on the coffee table. Since the second statement's condition that it might be under the couch is negated by the first statement, the alternative (that it is on the coffee table) must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
