Therefore, the condition that the watch must be on his wrist is false.\n\nGiven the structure of statement 2 (an either/or statement), and knowing that one part of the statement (the watch must be on his wrist) is false, the only remaining possibility is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nThus, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
