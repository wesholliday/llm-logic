Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack.\n\nLet's break down these statements:\n\nStatement 1 can be rewritten as:\n- The scarf must not be draped on the coat rack.\n\nStatement 2 is a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" statement):\n- Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\n\nFrom Statement 1, we know that it is not true that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack. Therefore, the condition that \"the scarf must be draped on the coat rack\" is false.\n\nGiven Statement 2's structure (A or B), and knowing that B (the scarf must be draped on the coat rack) is false, the only remaining possibility for the statement to hold true is for A (the scarf is stuffed in my backpack) to be true.\n\nThus, since the only way for Statement 2 to be true, given the falsity of one of its conditions (B), is for the other condition (A) to be true, we can infer that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
