It states that one of the two conditions must be true: either the book is on the shelf, or it must be resting on the table.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that it is not true that the book must be resting on the table. Therefore, the condition that \"the book must be resting on the table\" is false.\n\nGiven the structure of statement 2 (an either/or statement), and knowing that one part (\"it must be resting on the table\") is false, the only remaining possibility for the statement to hold true is that the other part (\"the book is on the shelf\") must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
