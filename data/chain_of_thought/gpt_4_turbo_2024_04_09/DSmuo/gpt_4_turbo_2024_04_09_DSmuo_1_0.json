Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\n\nLet's break down these statements:\n\nStatement 1 can be rewritten as:\n- \u00acMust(Fido in garden)\n\nStatement 2 can be rewritten as:\n- Fido is inside \u2228 Must(Fido in garden)\n\nFrom Statement 1, we know that it is not true that Fido must be in the garden. Therefore, \u00acMust(Fido in garden) is true.\n\nGiven that \u00acMust(Fido in garden) is true, and Statement 2 presents an \"either/or\" scenario (disjunction), the truth of \u00acMust(Fido in garden) negates the possibility of Must(Fido in garden) being true in this disjunction.\n\nThus, the only remaining possibility in the disjunction (Statement 2) is that Fido is inside.\n\nTherefore, from these premises, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
