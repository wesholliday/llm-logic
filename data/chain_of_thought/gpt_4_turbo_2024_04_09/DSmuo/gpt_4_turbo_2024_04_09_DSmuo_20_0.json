            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the statements given:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n   - This statement can be interpreted as saying that it is not necessary for the sunglasses to be on her head. In logical terms, we can denote this as \u00acP (where P stands for \"the sunglasses must be perched on her head\").\n\n2. \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction, which can be represented as B \u2228 P (where B stands for \"the sunglasses are in her bag\" and P stands for \"the sunglasses must be perched on her head\").\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use logical reasoning to determine the location of the sunglasses:\n\n- From statement 1, we have \u00acP.\n- From statement 2, we have B \u2228 P.\n\nUsing the rule of disjunction elimination, if we know \u00acP (the sunglasses are not necessarily perched on her head), and we have B \u2228 P (either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head), we can conclude that B must be true (the sunglasses are in her bag) because P has been negated.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical analysis of the statements, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
