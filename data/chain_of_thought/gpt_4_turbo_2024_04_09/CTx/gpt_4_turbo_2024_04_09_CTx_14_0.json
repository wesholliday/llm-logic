            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the given statement and its contrapositive.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\" In logical terms, this can be written as:\n\\[ P \\implies Q \\]\nwhere \\( P \\) is \"the clug was fleeked\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the clug snugged.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( P \\implies Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\implies \\neg P \\), which is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nApplying this to our case:\n- \\( P \\implies Q \\) translates to \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\"\n- \\( \\neg Q \\implies \\neg P \\) translates to \"If the clug did not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked.\"\n\nSince the contrapositive is always true if the original statement is true, we can infer that \"If the clug did not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked\" is a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
