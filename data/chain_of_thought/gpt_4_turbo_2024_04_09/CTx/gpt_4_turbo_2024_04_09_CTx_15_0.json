            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given, despite the unfamiliar terms. The statement \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\" can be translated into a logical implication:\n\n1. \\( V \\rightarrow S \\)\n\nWhere:\n- \\( V \\) represents \"the dreb was vroombed\"\n- \\( S \\) represents \"the dreb was spened\"\n\nWe are asked to determine if from this statement, we can infer \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\". This can be translated into another logical implication:\n\n2. \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg V \\)\n\nThis is the contrapositive of the original statement \\( V \\rightarrow S \\). In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. That is, if \\( V \\rightarrow S \\) is true, then \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg V \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical equivalence of a statement and its contrapositive:\n\nAnswer: yes",
