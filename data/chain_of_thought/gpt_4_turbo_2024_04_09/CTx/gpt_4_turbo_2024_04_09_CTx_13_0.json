            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"the glip was slogged\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the glip was tragged\".\n\n2. We need to determine if the following statement is true based on the original statement: \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\n3. The statement \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is known as the contrapositive of the original statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. That is, if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, then \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is also true.\n\n4. Since the original statement \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\" is given as true, its contrapositive \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
