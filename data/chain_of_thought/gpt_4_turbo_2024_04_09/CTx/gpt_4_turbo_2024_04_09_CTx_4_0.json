            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given and apply the principle of contraposition.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\" In logical terms, this can be expressed as:\n\\[ P \\implies Q \\]\nwhere \\( P \\) is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the fribble crinked.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( P \\implies Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\implies \\neg P \\), where \\( \\neg \\) denotes negation. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nApplying this to the given statement:\n- Original: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\" (\\( P \\implies Q \\))\n- Contrapositive: \"If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\" (\\( \\neg Q \\implies \\neg P \\))\n\nSince the contrapositive is equivalent to the original statement, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked,\" we can indeed infer that \"If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
