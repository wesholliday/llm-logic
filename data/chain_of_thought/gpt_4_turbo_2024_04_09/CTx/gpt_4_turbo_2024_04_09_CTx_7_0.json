            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\" In logical form, this can be written as: \n\nP \u2192 Q\n\nwhere P is \"the whiffle was shanked\" and Q is \"the whiffle tinked.\"\n\nWe are asked to determine if we can infer the statement: \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement, which in logical form is:\n\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement (P \u2192 Q) is true, then its contrapositive (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP) is also true.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked,\" we can indeed infer that \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
