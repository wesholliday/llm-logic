            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\" In logical terms, this can be written as: \n\nIf P, then Q.\n\nWhere:\nP = the wug was sproinged\nQ = the wug was garpled\n\nWe are asked to determine if we can infer the following statement from the original: \"If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged.\" This can be written as:\n\nIf not Q, then not P.\n\nThis is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement always has the same truth value as the statement itself. Therefore, if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\nThus, from the statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled,\" we can indeed infer that \"If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
