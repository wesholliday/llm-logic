            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\" In logical terms, this can be written as:\n\nP \u2192 Q\n\nwhere P is \"the zinger was fraggled\" and Q is \"the zinger was smoogled.\"\n\nWe are asked to determine if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement P \u2192 Q is:\n\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nwhere \u00acQ is \"the zinger was not smoogled\" and \u00acP is \"the zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\nSince the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the statement itself, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nThus, from the statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled,\" we can indeed infer that \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
