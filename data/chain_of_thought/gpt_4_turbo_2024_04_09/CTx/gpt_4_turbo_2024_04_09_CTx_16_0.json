            "content": "The statement given is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q\". Here, P is \"the sneg was crampled\" and Q is \"the sneg sproted the frink\". \n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically the contrapositive, the statement \"If P, then Q\" implies \"If not Q, then not P\". This is a valid logical inference and holds true for any conditional statement.\n\nApplying this to the given statement:\n- P: the sneg was crampled\n- Q: the sneg sproted the frink\n\nThe contrapositive would be:\n- If not Q (the sneg did not sprot the frink), then not P (the sneg was not crampled).\n\nThus, from the statement \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\", we can infer \"If the sneg did not sprot the frink, then the sneg was not crampled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
