            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\" In logical terms, this can be written as:\n\nP \u2192 Q\n\nwhere P is \"the splat was morphed\" and Q is \"the splat quanked.\"\n\nThe question asks whether we can infer the statement \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed\" from the original statement. This new statement can be written as:\n\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nThis is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement has the same truth value as the statement itself. Therefore, if the original statement (P \u2192 Q) is true, then its contrapositive (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP) is also true.\n\nThus, from the statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked,\" we can indeed infer that \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
