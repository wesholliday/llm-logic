            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" In logical terms, this can be written as:\n\nP \u2192 Q\n\nwhere P is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and Q is \"the sprocket was daggled.\"\n\nThe question asks whether we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, where \u00acQ is \"the sprocket was not daggled\" and \u00acP is \"the sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement would be: \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nSince the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the statement itself, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
