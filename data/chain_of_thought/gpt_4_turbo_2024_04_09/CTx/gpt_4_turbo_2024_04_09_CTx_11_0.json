            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given and apply the rules of logic to determine if the inference is valid.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\" In logical terms, this can be written as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"the flug was blummed\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the flug was zimmed\".\n\n2. We need to determine if the following statement logically follows from the original: \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\n3. The statement \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is known as the contrapositive of the original statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). One of the fundamental rules of logic is that a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. That is, if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, then \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is also true.\n\n4. Since the original statement \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\" is assumed true, its contrapositive \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
