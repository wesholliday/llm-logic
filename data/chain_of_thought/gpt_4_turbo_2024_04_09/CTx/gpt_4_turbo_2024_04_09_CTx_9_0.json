            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\" In logical terms, this can be written as:\n\nP \u2192 V\n\nWhere:\nP = The twonk was plinked\nV = The twonk was varnished\n\nWe need to determine if the statement \"If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked\" logically follows from the original statement. This new statement can be written as:\n\n\u00acV \u2192 \u00acP\n\nThis is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement has the same truth value as the statement itself. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion of the original statement and swapping them. \n\nSo, the contrapositive of P \u2192 V is \u00acV \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nSince the contrapositive always has the same truth value as the original statement, and since the original statement is assumed true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished,\" we can indeed infer that \"If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
