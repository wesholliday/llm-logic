Where P is \"the wug was flooped\" and Q is \"the wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" This is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nApplying this to our statement:\n- Original: If P (the wug was flooped), then Q (the wug bimmed the zoint).\n- Contrapositive: If not Q (the wug did not bim the zoint), then not P (the wug was not flooped).\n\nThus, the statement \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped\" is the contrapositive of the original statement and is logically equivalent to it.\n\nAnswer: yes",
