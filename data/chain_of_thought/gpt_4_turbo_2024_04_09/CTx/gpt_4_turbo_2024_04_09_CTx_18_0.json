            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given, using the concept of contraposition in logic.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\" In logical terms, this can be written as:\n\\[ P \\implies Q \\]\nwhere \\( P \\) represents \"the shank was plooked\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"the shank was nugged.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\implies Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\implies \\neg P \\), where \\( \\neg \\) denotes negation. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nApplying this to the given statement:\n- Original: \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\" (\\( P \\implies Q \\))\n- Contrapositive: \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\" (\\( \\neg Q \\implies \\neg P \\))\n\nSince the contrapositive is equivalent to the original statement, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged,\" we can indeed infer that \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
