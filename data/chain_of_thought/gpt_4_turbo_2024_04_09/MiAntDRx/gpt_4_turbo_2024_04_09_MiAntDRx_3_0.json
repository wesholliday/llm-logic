            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The fribble might be in the blurble or on the wumble\" suggests two possible locations for the fribble: either \"in the blurble\" or \"on the wumble.\" The use of \"or\" in this context indicates that either of these possibilities could be true. Therefore, it is indeed a valid inference to say that \"The fribble might be on the wumble,\" as this is one of the options explicitly mentioned in the original statement. The statement does not confirm that the fribble is definitely on the wumble, but it allows for the possibility, which is what the inference is suggesting.\n\nAnswer: yes",
