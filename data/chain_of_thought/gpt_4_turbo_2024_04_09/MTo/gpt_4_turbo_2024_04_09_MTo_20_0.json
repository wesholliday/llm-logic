It can be written in logical form as:\n   If A (the apple was red), then B (the banana was yellow).\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that B is false (the banana was not yellow), we can infer something about A (the apple was red) based on the structure of the conditional statement. \n\nIn logic, if a conditional statement (\"If A, then B\") is true and B is false, then A must also be false. This is because a true conditional statement cannot have a true antecedent (A) and a false consequent (B). This is known as modus tollens in logical reasoning.\n\nTherefore, since \"the banana was not yellow\" (B is false) and \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is assumed true, it must be that \"the apple was not red\" (A is false).\n\nAnswer: yes",
