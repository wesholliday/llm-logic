We also know the conditional statement \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\"\n\nFrom the conditional statement, we can use the contrapositive to infer a new statement. The contrapositive of \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" is \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\"\n\nSince we know the robot did not visit Jupiter, by the contrapositive, we can conclude that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
