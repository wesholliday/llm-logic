It can be interpreted as: the only situation in which the truck could be blue is if the car was red. \n\nSince we know from statement 1 that the truck was not blue, we can infer that the condition that would make the truck blue (the car being red) did not occur. \n\nTherefore, the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
