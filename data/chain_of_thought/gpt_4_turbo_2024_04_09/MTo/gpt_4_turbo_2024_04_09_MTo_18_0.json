In logical form, this is P \u2192 M.\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the truck was not metal, which is \u00acM.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens, if we have P \u2192 M and \u00acM, we can conclude \u00acP. This means if \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" and \"The truck was not metal,\" then it must be true that \"The doll was not plastic.\"\n\nThus, based on the given statements, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
