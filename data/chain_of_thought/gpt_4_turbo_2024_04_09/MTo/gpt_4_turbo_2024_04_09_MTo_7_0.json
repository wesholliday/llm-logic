If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nWe need to determine if these statements allow us to infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nFrom statement 2, we have a conditional statement: If Alex finished the race (P), then Chris finished the race (Q). This can be written as P \u2192 Q.\n\nStatement 1 tells us that Chris did not finish the race, which means Q is false.\n\nIn logic, if we have P \u2192 Q, and Q is false, then P must also be false for the conditional statement to hold true. This is because a true conclusion (Q) cannot follow from a false premise (P) in standard logic; thus, if the conclusion (Q) is false, the premise (P) that leads to it must also be false.\n\nTherefore, since Q (Chris finished the race) is false, P (Alex finished the race) must also be false to maintain the truth of the conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
