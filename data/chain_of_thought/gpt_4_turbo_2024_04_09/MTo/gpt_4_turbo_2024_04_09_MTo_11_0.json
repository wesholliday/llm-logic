It can be written in logical form as:\n   If P (the cake was chocolate), then Q (the muffins were blueberry).\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that Q is false (the muffins were not blueberry), we can use the rule of contraposition in logic. The contrapositive of the statement \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P.\" Therefore, the contrapositive of statement 2 is:\n   If not Q (the muffins were not blueberry), then not P (the cake was not chocolate).\n\nGiven that not Q is true (the muffins were not blueberry), it follows that not P must also be true (the cake was not chocolate).\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
