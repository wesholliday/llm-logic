It can be interpreted as: the presence of Mary at the wedding implies the presence of Sue at the wedding. \n\nSince we know from statement 1 that Sue was definitely not at the wedding, and statement 2 tells us that if Mary were at the wedding, Sue would have to be there too, the only way both these statements can be true is if Mary was not at the wedding. If Mary had been at the wedding, it would contradict the fact that Sue was not there, as per statement 2.\n\nThus, from these premises, we can logically infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
