It can be written in logical form as:\n   If G (the griffin was in the forest), then U (the unicorn was in the forest).\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that U is false (the unicorn was not in the forest), we can use the rule of contraposition on statement 2. The contrapositive of \"If G then U\" is \"If not U then not G.\" \n\nGiven that U is false (not U is true), the contrapositive tells us that not G must also be true. Therefore, the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
