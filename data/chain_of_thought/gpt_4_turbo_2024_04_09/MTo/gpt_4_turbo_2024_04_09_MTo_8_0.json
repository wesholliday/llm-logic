            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given:\n\n1. \"The mummy was not awake.\"\n2. \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n\nWe start by understanding the implications of each statement:\n\n1. The first statement clearly asserts that the mummy was not awake.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement. It can be written in logical form as: If V (vampire was awake), then M (mummy was awake).\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that M is false (the mummy was not awake). The conditional statement \"If V then M\" implies that whenever V is true, M must also be true. However, since we know M is false, V must also be false to maintain the truth of the conditional statement. If V were true, then M would also need to be true, which contradicts the information given in the first statement.\n\nTherefore, since having V true leads to a contradiction, V must be false. This means the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
