We also have the conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\n3. Using the contrapositive of the conditional statement, which is a valid logical inference, we can rephrase it as: \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\"\n\n4. Since we know from the first statement that \"The book is not a mystery novel,\" we can apply the contrapositive: \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\"\n\n5. Therefore, based on the information given and the logical inference, we can conclude that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
