If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n\nWe need to determine if these statements allow us to infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement: If Jeff played basketball (condition), then Amy played tennis (result). \n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Amy did not play tennis. According to the rules of logic, if the result of a conditional statement is false, then the condition that leads to it must also be false for the statement to hold true. \n\nIn this case, since Amy did not play tennis (the result is false), the condition that Jeff played basketball must also be false for the conditional statement to be true. Therefore, Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
