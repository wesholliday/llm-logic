This can be written as P \u2192 Q.\n\nStatement 1 tells us that Q is false (the wolf was not in the den).\n\nIn logic, if we have P \u2192 Q (if P then Q) and we know Q is false, then P must also be false to maintain logical consistency. This is because if P were true while Q is false, it would contradict the truth of P \u2192 Q.\n\nTherefore, since Q (the wolf was in the den) is false, P (the bear was in the cave) must also be false to avoid contradiction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
