            "content": "To solve this, let's analyze the statements given:\n\n1. Erin did not take a train.\n2. If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n\nWe need to determine if these statements allow us to infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement: If Sam took a plane (P), then Erin took a train (Q). This can be written as P \u2192 Q.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Q is false (Erin did not take a train).\n\nIn logic, if a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is true and Q is false, then P must also be false to maintain the truth of the conditional statement. This is because a true conditional statement cannot have a true antecedent (P) and a false consequent (Q).\n\nSince we know:\n- P \u2192 Q (If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train)\n- Q is false (Erin did not take a train)\n\nWe can conclude:\n- P must be false (Sam did not take a plane).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
