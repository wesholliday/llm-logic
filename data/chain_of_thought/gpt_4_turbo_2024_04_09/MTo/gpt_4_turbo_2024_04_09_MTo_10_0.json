It can be written in logical form as:\n   If D (the dog was inside), then C (the cat was outside).\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that C is false (the cat was not outside), we can analyze the truth of the conditional statement. A conditional statement is false only if the premise is true and the conclusion is false. Here, the conclusion (C) is false. For the conditional statement to be true under these circumstances, the premise (D) must also be false. \n\nTherefore, the dog was not inside, because if the dog were inside, it would make the conditional statement false (since the cat was not outside).\n\nAnswer: no",
