            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the statements given:\n\n1. The pants were not denim.\n2. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n\nWe start by examining the second statement, which is a conditional statement. It can be written in logical form as:\n\\[ \\text{If (shirt is cotton)} \\rightarrow \\text{(pants are denim)} \\]\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, a conditional statement \"If P then Q\" is false only if P is true and Q is false. In all other cases, it is true.\n\nGiven the first statement, we know:\n\\[ \\text{Pants are not denim} \\]\nThis is the Q part of our conditional statement, and it is false.\n\nNow, if the conditional statement is to remain true (since we have no information that it is false), and since Q is false, P must also be false to maintain the truth of the conditional statement. Therefore:\n\\[ \\text{Shirt is not cotton} \\]\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
