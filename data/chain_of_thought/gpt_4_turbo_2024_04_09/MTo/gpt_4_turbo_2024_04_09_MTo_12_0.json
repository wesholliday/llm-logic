It can be interpreted as: the condition of Joe going to the park guarantees that Lucy went to the zoo. \n\nSince we know from statement 1 that Lucy did not go to the zoo, we can infer that the condition set by statement 2 (Joe going to the park) did not occur. If Joe had gone to the park, then Lucy would have had to go to the zoo, according to statement 2. But since Lucy definitely did not go to the zoo, it must be true that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nTherefore, based on these statements, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
