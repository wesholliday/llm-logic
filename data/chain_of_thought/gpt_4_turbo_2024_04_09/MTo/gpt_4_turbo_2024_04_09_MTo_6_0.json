If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n\nWe need to determine if these statements allow us to infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nFrom statement 2, we have a conditional statement: If Sue chose pizza (antecedent), then Bob chose pasta (consequent). \n\nGiven statement 1, we know that Bob did not choose pasta. According to the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens (the denial of the consequent), if the consequent of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent must also be false. \n\nApplying modus tollens here:\n- Consequent: Bob chose pasta.\n- Antecedent: Sue chose pizza.\n\nSince the consequent (Bob chose pasta) is false (as per statement 1), the antecedent (Sue chose pizza) must also be false.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
