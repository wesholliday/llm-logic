If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nThe first statement clearly states that Jen did not watch basketball. The second statement is a conditional statement that can be written in logical form as: If P (Tom watched football), then Q (Jen watched basketball).\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Q is false (Jen did not watch basketball). According to the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens, if \"If P then Q\" is true and Q is false, then P must also be false. \n\nTherefore, since Q (Jen watched basketball) is false, P (Tom watched football) must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
