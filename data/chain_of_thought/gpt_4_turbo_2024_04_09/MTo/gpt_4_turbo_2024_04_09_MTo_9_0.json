It can be written in logical form as:\n   If L (Lisa bought the red shirt), then M (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that Mark did not buy the blue shirt (\u00acM is true), and the conditional statement (If L then M) must hold true, we must evaluate the truth of L (Lisa bought the red shirt).\n\nIn a conditional statement, if the consequent (M) is false, then the antecedent (L) must also be false for the statement to hold true. This is because a true conditional statement cannot have a true antecedent leading to a false consequent. Therefore, since M is false, L must also be false to maintain the truth of the conditional statement.\n\nThus, Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
