However, knowing that \\( C \\) is true does not necessarily imply that \\( A \\) is true. This is because a conditional statement does not specify what happens when the consequent (in this case, \\( C \\)) is true independently of the antecedent (in this case, \\( A \\)). \n\nIn other words, \\( C \\) being true does not provide information about the truth value of \\( A \\). Chris finishing the race could happen whether Alex finished the race or not, based on the information given.\n\nTherefore, from the truth of \"Chris finished the race,\" we cannot conclude that \"Alex finished the race\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: no",
