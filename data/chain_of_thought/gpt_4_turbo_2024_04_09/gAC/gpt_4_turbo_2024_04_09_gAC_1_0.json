However, it does not state that if Sue is at the wedding, then Mary must be there. The truth of Sue being at the wedding (S) does not necessarily imply the truth of Mary being at the wedding (M). \n\nIn logical terms, the statement \"If M, then S\" does not logically equate to \"If S, then M.\" Therefore, knowing that Sue was at the wedding does not provide enough information to conclude definitively that Mary was also there.\n\nAnswer: no",
