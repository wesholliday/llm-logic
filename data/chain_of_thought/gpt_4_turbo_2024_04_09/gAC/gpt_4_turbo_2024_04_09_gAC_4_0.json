In logical terms, it can be represented as: If A (the alien visited Mars), then B (the robot visited Jupiter).\n\n2. \"The robot visited Jupiter\" - This is a statement of fact, represented as B.\n\nWe are asked to determine if \"The alien visited Mars\" (A) must also be true given these statements.\n\nThe logical form of the first statement is A \u2192 B. This means that if A is true, then B must be true. However, the reverse is not necessarily true; B being true does not imply that A must be true. The truth of B (the robot visited Jupiter) does not depend solely on A (the alien visited Mars); B could be true for reasons unrelated to A.\n\nSince the truth of B does not guarantee the truth of A, we cannot conclude that \"The alien visited Mars\" is true based solely on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
