However, it does not state that if the mummy is awake, the vampire must also be awake. The truth of M (mummy was awake) does not necessarily imply the truth of V (vampire was awake) because the condition could be satisfied another way \u2014 the mummy might be awake independently of the vampire's state.\n\nTherefore, from the truth of M alone, we cannot conclude that V must also be true. The vampire could be asleep, and the mummy could still be awake without contradicting the given conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
