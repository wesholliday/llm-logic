            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use logical reasoning based on the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" This can be represented as: If V (vampire was awake), then M (mummy was awake). In logical terms, V \u2192 M.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\" This statement implies that the mummy was not awake, \u00acM.\n\nFrom these statements, we can use the rule of contraposition on the first statement. The contraposition of V \u2192 M is \u00acM \u2192 \u00acV, which means \"if the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\"\n\nGiven that the second statement confirms \u00acM (the mummy was not awake), we can apply the contrapositive rule:\n\nSince \u00acM is true, then \u00acV must also be true, which means the vampire was not awake.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and logical deduction, we can infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
