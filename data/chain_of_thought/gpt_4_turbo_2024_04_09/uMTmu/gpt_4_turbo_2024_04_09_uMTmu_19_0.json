            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use logical reasoning based on the given statements:\n\n1. If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This can be represented as: \n   \\( T \\rightarrow J \\)\n   where \\( T \\) is \"Tom watched football\" and \\( J \\) is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n2. It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. This can be represented as:\n   \\( \\neg J \\)\n   where \\( \\neg J \\) means \"Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n\nGiven \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) (if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball) and \\( \\neg J \\) (Jen did not watch basketball), we can use the rule of contraposition on the first statement. The contrapositive of \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) is \\( \\neg J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) (if Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football).\n\nSince we know \\( \\neg J \\) is true (Jen did not watch basketball), we can conclude \\( \\neg T \\) (Tom did not watch football) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical deduction from the given statements, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
