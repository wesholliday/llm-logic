            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use logical reasoning:\n\n1. We start with the conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as: If James wrote the book (J), then the book is a mystery novel (M). Symbolically, J \u2192 M.\n\n2. Next, we have the statement: \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\" This means that the book being a mystery novel is not a necessity. Symbolically, \u00acM.\n\n3. From the first statement (J \u2192 M), if James wrote the book, then it must be a mystery novel. However, from the second statement, we know that the book is not a mystery novel (\u00acM).\n\n4. Applying modus tollens, a rule of logic, to the statements:\n   - J \u2192 M (If James wrote the book, then it is a mystery novel)\n   - \u00acM (The book is not a mystery novel)\n   We can conclude \u00acJ (James did not write the book).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and logical deduction, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
