It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\n\nFrom the first statement, we understand that Alex finishing the race is a sufficient condition for Chris finishing the race. This means that if Alex finishes, then Chris definitely finishes.\n\nThe second statement tells us that Chris did not necessarily finish the race. This implies that the condition where Chris must finish (which is dependent on Alex finishing, according to the first statement) did not occur.\n\nGiven that Chris finishing is contingent on Alex finishing, and since it is established that Chris did not necessarily finish, we can infer that the condition requiring Chris to finish (Alex finishing) did not occur.\n\nTherefore, Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
