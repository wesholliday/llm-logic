            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use logical reasoning:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\" This can be represented as: If J, then A.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\" This negates the consequent of the first statement, meaning not A.\n\n3. From the structure of the first statement (If J, then A), and knowing that A is false (not A), we can use the rule of contraposition. The contrapositive of \"If J, then A\" is \"If not A, then not J.\"\n\n4. Since we know not A is true, the contrapositive tells us that not J must also be true.\n\n5. Therefore, Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
