This is because a true conditional statement cannot have a true antecedent (P) and a false consequent (Q).\n\nTherefore, if it is not the case that the muffins were blueberry (Q is false), and if the cake being chocolate implies that the muffins were blueberry (P implies Q), then the cake was not chocolate (P is false).\n\nAnswer: yes",
