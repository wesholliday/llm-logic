It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can express it as a conditional: If B (bear was in the cave), then W (wolf must have been in the den).\n\nThe second statement negates W: Not W (it's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den).\n\nUsing the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens, we can infer the following:\n- If B implies W, and Not W is true, then Not B must also be true.\n\nTherefore, since it is given that the wolf was not necessarily in the den (Not W), and if the bear being in the cave implies that the wolf must have been in the den (B implies W), we can conclude that the bear was not in the cave (Not B).\n\nAnswer: yes",
