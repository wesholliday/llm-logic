            "content": "The problem presents two statements:\n\n1. If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\n2. It's not the case that the cat must have been outside.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can express the relationship as a conditional statement: If Dog is inside (D), then Cat is outside (C). Symbolically, this is D \u2192 C.\n\nStatement 2 negates the consequent of the conditional statement in statement 1, indicating that it is not necessarily true that the cat must have been outside. Symbolically, this is \u00acC.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens, if we have a conditional statement (D \u2192 C) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acC), we can infer the negation of the antecedent (\u00acD). This means if it is not true that the cat was outside, then it is not true that the dog was inside.\n\nThus, based on the given statements and using modus tollens, we can infer that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
