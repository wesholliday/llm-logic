            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use logical reasoning:\n\n1. The statement given is: \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\"\n   - This can be represented as: If A (apple is red), then B (banana is yellow).\n\n2. Another part of the statement is: \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\"\n   - This can be represented as: Not B (banana is not yellow).\n\n3. From the logical implication in step 1 (If A then B), and the information in step 2 (Not B), we can use the rule of contraposition. The contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\"\n\n4. Since we know Not B (banana is not yellow) is true, the contrapositive tells us that Not A (apple is not red) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
