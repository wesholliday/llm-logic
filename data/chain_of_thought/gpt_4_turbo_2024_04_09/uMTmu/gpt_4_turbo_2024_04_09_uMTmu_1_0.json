            "content": "The problem presents two statements:\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\n2. It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\nFrom the first statement, we understand that Mary's presence at the wedding guarantees Sue's presence. This is a conditional statement where Mary's attendance implies Sue's attendance.\n\nThe second statement tells us that Sue's presence at the wedding is not guaranteed. This means that Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n\nGiven that Sue's presence is not guaranteed (from the second statement), and knowing that if Mary were there, Sue would have to be there (from the first statement), we can conclude that Mary could not have been at the wedding. If Mary had been at the wedding, it would contradict the information that Sue's presence is not guaranteed, because Mary's presence would necessitate Sue's presence.\n\nTherefore, since Sue's presence is not guaranteed, and Mary's presence would guarantee Sue's presence, Mary must not have been at the wedding to maintain the truth of the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
