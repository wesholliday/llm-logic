It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can express it as a conditional: If A (alien visited Mars), then R (robot visited Jupiter).\n\nThe second statement negates the consequent of the first statement, stating that R is not true.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens, if we have a conditional statement (If A, then R) and the consequent (R) is false, then the antecedent (A) must also be false.\n\nTherefore, since it is not true that the robot visited Jupiter (R is false), we can conclude that the alien did not visit Mars (A is false).\n\nAnswer: yes",
