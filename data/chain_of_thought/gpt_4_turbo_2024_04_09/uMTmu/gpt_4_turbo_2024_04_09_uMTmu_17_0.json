(This can be represented as: If P, then Q.)\n2. It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad. (This can be represented as: Not Q.)\n\nFrom these statements, we can use the rule of contraposition in logic. The contraposition of the first statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nGiven that it's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad (Not Q), we can apply the contraposition to infer that Ben did not eat pasta (Not P).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical deduction from the given statements, we can conclude:\n\nAnswer: yes",
