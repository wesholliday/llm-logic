            "content": "The problem presents a conditional statement and its negation:\n\n1. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as: If L (Lisa bought the red shirt), then M (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This negates the consequent of the conditional statement, meaning \u00acM (Mark did not buy the blue shirt).\n\nFrom these statements, we can use the logical rule of modus tollens, which states that if \"If P then Q\" is true and Q is false (\u00acQ), then P must also be false (\u00acP). Applying this rule here:\n\n- If L then M (given)\n- \u00acM (given)\n\nTherefore, by modus tollens, \u00acL (Lisa did not buy the red shirt).\n\nThus, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
