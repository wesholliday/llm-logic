It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can express it as a conditional: If P (Sam took a plane), then Q (Erin took a train).\n\nThe second statement negates Q, meaning Erin did not necessarily take a train.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens, we can infer the following:\n- If P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\nSince it is established that Q (Erin took a train) is not true, and P implies Q, then P (Sam took a plane) must also be false.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
