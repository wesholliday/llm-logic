            "content": "The problem presents two statements:\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n2. It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nFrom the first statement, we understand that Joe going to the park is a sufficient condition for Lucy going to the zoo. This means that if Joe did go to the park, then it necessarily follows that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nThe second statement tells us that it is not true that Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This implies that whatever conditions would make Lucy's going to the zoo a necessity did not occur.\n\nCombining these two statements, if Joe going to the park makes it necessary for Lucy to go to the zoo, but Lucy did not necessarily go to the zoo, then Joe could not have gone to the park. If he had, it would contradict the second statement that Lucy's going to the zoo is not a necessity.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical connection between these statements, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
