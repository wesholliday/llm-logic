            "content": "To analyze the statement, we need to understand the implications of the modal verbs \"might\" and \"must.\"\n\n1. The statement \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" suggests that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza. However, it does not confirm whether she did or did not choose pizza. It simply opens up the possibility that she might have chosen something else.\n\n2. The phrase \"it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" implies that it is not necessarily true that Sue chose pizza. In other words, there is no certainty or requirement that her choice was pizza.\n\n3. If we accept that there is a possibility (\"might not\") that Sue did not choose pizza, then it logically follows that it cannot be definitively stated that she \"must\" have chosen pizza. The use of \"must\" would imply certainty or necessity, which is contradicted by the possibility that she might not have chosen pizza.\n\nTherefore, from the statement that Sue might not have chosen pizza, we can infer that it is not necessarily the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
