            "content": "The statement \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\" implies that there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This statement introduces uncertainty or doubt about whether Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nThe phrase \"it's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" means that it is not necessarily true or required that Lisa bought the red shirt. This statement negates any certainty or requirement that Lisa definitely bought the red shirt.\n\nGiven that the original statement introduces uncertainty about Lisa buying the red shirt, it logically follows that we cannot be certain or conclude definitively that she must have bought the red shirt. Therefore, it is indeed correct to infer that it's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
