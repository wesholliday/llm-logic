            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the implications of the statement \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\"\n\n1. The statement \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" suggests that there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding. This implies uncertainty about her presence.\n\n2. If it is stated that \"Mary must have been at the wedding,\" this would mean it is certain and necessary that Mary was at the wedding.\n\n3. The presence of uncertainty (Mary might not have been there) contradicts the assertion of necessity (Mary must have been there).\n\n4. Therefore, if it is possible that Mary might not have been at the wedding, it cannot simultaneously be necessary that she was definitely at the wedding.\n\nFrom this reasoning, we can conclude that if Mary might not have been at the wedding, it is not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
