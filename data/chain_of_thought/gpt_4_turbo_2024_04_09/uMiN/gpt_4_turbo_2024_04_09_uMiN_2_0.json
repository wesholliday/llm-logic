If it is possible that the griffin was not in the forest, then it cannot be necessarily true that the griffin must have been in the forest. The use of \"might not\" introduces uncertainty or possibility, which contradicts the certainty implied by \"must have been.\" Therefore, from the statement that the griffin might not have been in the forest, we can infer that it is not necessarily the case that the griffin must have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
