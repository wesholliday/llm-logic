The statement \"Alex might not have finished the race\" implies there is a possibility that Alex did not finish the race. This statement introduces uncertainty about whether Alex completed the race.\n\n2. The modal verb \"might\" indicates a possibility but not certainty. It suggests that there are scenarios where Alex did not finish the race, though it does not confirm that this definitely happened.\n\n3. If it is stated that \"Alex must have finished the race,\" it means it is certain that Alex finished the race, without any doubt.\n\n4. Since \"Alex might not have finished the race\" introduces the possibility that Alex did not finish, it contradicts the certainty implied by \"must have finished.\" Therefore, if there is a possibility that Alex did not finish, it cannot be true that Alex definitely finished the race.\n\n5. Thus, from the statement \"Alex might not have finished the race,\" we can infer that it is not certain that Alex finished the race, meaning it is not the case that Alex must have finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
