            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the statement and the question.\n\n1. The statement given is: \"The sunglasses might not be in her bag.\"\n2. This statement implies that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not in her bag. However, it does not confirm whether they are or aren't in the bag; it only opens up the possibility that they might not be.\n\n3. The question asks: \"Can we infer that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag?\"\n4. To infer that \"it's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag\" means to conclude that there is no necessity or certainty that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\n5. Since the original statement allows for the possibility that the sunglasses might not be in her bag, it directly implies that their being in the bag is not a certainty or a necessity.\n\n6. Therefore, from the statement that the sunglasses might not be in her bag, we can logically infer that it is not necessarily the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
