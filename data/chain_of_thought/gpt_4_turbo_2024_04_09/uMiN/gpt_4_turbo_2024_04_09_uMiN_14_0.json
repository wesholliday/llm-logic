The statement given is: \"The milk might not be on the counter.\"\n2. This statement implies that there is a possibility that the milk is not on the counter. However, it does not confirm whether the milk is actually on the counter or not.\n3. The question asks if we can infer that \"it's not the case that the milk must be on the counter\" based on the given statement.\n\nFrom the statement, since there is a possibility that the milk is not on the counter, it means that the presence of the milk on the counter is not a necessity; it is not mandatory or certain. Therefore, it is not the case that the milk must be on the counter, because the statement allows for the possibility that the milk might be elsewhere.\n\nAnswer: yes",
