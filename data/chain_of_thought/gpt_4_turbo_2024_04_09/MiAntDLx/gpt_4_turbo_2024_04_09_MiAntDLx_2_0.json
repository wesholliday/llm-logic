            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The fribble might be on the blurble or in the wobble\" suggests two possibilities for the location of the fribble: it might be on the blurble, or it might be in the wobble. The use of \"or\" in this context indicates that either one of these possibilities could be true, but it does not necessarily mean that both must be true simultaneously. Therefore, from this statement, it can be inferred that there is a possibility that the fribble is on the blurble. This inference is valid because the statement explicitly mentions that being on the blurble is a possibility for the fribble.\n\nAnswer: yes",
