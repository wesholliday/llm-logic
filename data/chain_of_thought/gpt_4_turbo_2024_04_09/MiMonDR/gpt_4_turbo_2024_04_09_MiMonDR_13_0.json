            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The meeting might be cancelled\" implies that there is a possibility of the meeting being cancelled. However, it does not explicitly state that the meeting is definitely cancelled, only that it is a possibility. \n\nWhen considering the statement \"The meeting might be scheduled or cancelled,\" this suggests two possibilities: the meeting might still go ahead as planned (scheduled), or it might not take place (cancelled). Given that the original statement allows for the possibility of cancellation, it is also implicitly allowing for the possibility that the meeting might still occur (be scheduled) if it is not cancelled. Therefore, the statement \"The meeting might be cancelled\" does indeed fit within the broader range of possibilities indicated by \"The meeting might be scheduled or cancelled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
