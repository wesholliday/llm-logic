            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The computer might be broken\" suggests the possibility that the computer is not functioning properly. However, it does not confirm the state of the computer; it merely opens up one potential scenario (that the computer is broken). The statement \"The computer might be working or broken\" encompasses two possibilities: that the computer is either functioning properly or it is not. This statement is broader and includes the possibility already mentioned (\"might be broken\") along with the additional possibility that the computer might be working. Since the original statement allows for the possibility that the computer is broken, and does not exclude the possibility that it might also be working, it logically fits within the broader scope of \"might be working or broken.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
