            "content": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the statements given:\n\n1. It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\n   - This can be interpreted as: The mummy was not necessarily awake; it's possible that the mummy was asleep.\n\n2. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\n   - This is a conditional statement. If the condition (the vampire being awake) is true, then the result (the mummy must have been awake) must also be true.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the mummy was not necessarily awake. This implies that there could have been a situation where the mummy was not awake.\n\nNow, consider statement 2. If the vampire had been awake, then according to this statement, the mummy must have been awake. However, from statement 1, we know that it's not necessarily true that the mummy was awake. Therefore, the only way both statements can be true is if the condition that would require the mummy to be awake (i.e., the vampire being awake) did not occur.\n\nThus, since having the vampire awake leads to a contradiction with the first statement (that the mummy was not necessarily awake), the vampire must not have been awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
