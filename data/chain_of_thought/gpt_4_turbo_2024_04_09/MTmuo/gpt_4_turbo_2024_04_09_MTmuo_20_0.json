            "content": "To solve this, let's analyze the statements given:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as saying that it is not necessarily true that the banana was yellow. It could have been another color.\n\n2. \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. If the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the result (the banana must have been yellow) must also be true.\n\nGiven the first statement, we know that the banana was not necessarily yellow. This contradicts the result of the second statement if the condition (the apple being red) were true. Since accepting the condition leads to a contradiction with the known fact (the banana was not necessarily yellow), the condition (the apple being red) must be false to avoid contradiction.\n\nTherefore, from these statements, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
