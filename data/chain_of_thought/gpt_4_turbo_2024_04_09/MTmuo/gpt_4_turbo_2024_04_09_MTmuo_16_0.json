            "content": "To solve this, let's analyze the statements given:\n\n1. It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\n   - This can be interpreted as: The pants were not necessarily denim. It's possible they were not denim.\n\n2. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\n   - This is a conditional statement. If the condition (the shirt was cotton) is true, then the result (the pants must have been denim) must also be true.\n\nGiven the first statement, we know that the pants were not necessarily denim. This contradicts the result of the second statement if the condition (the shirt was cotton) were true. Since the result (the pants must have been denim) is false, and the conditional statement (if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim) must hold true, the only possibility is that the condition (the shirt was cotton) is false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
