If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that Erin definitely did not take a train, or it is not necessary that Erin took a train.\n\nStatement 2 establishes a conditional relationship: if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n\nGiven that we know from statement 1 that Erin did not take a train, we can infer that the condition in statement 2 where \"Erin must have taken a train\" cannot be true. Since this condition is linked to Sam taking a plane, and it results in a false outcome (Erin taking a train), it must be that the premise leading to this condition (Sam taking a plane) is also false.\n\nTherefore, since the outcome of Sam taking a plane leads to a contradiction with the known fact (Erin did not take a train), Sam could not have taken a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
