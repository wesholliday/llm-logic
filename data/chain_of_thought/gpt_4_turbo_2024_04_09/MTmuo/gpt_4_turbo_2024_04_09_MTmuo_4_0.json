We can denote this as \u00ac\u25a1R (it is not necessary that R, where R = \"the robot visited Jupiter\").\n\n2. \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\" This can be represented as A \u2192 \u25a1R (if A, then necessarily R, where A = \"the alien visited Mars\").\n\nWe need to determine if these statements together imply that \"The alien did not visit Mars\" (\u00acA).\n\nFrom statement 1, we have \u00ac\u25a1R, meaning it is not necessarily the case that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nFrom statement 2, A \u2192 \u25a1R, if the alien visited Mars, then it must be that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nGiven \u00ac\u25a1R (it is not necessarily the case that the robot visited Jupiter), if A were true (the alien visited Mars), it would contradict \u00ac\u25a1R because A \u2192 \u25a1R would mean it is necessarily the case that the robot visited Jupiter. Therefore, to maintain consistency and avoid contradiction, A must be false.\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
