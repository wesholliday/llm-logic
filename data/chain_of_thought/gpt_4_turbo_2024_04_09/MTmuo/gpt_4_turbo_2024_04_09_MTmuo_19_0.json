If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that Jen watching basketball is not a necessity. This can be represented as \u00ac\u25a1J (it is not necessarily the case that Jen watched basketball).\n\nStatement 2 can be represented as T \u2192 \u25a1J (if Tom watched football, then it is necessarily the case that Jen watched basketball).\n\nWe need to determine if these statements allow us to infer that Tom did not watch football (\u00acT).\n\nUsing the contrapositive of statement 2, which is \u00ac\u25a1J \u2192 \u00acT (if it is not necessarily the case that Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football), we can see that this directly uses the information from statement 1 (\u00ac\u25a1J).\n\nSince statement 1 tells us that \u00ac\u25a1J is true, and the contrapositive of statement 2 tells us that if \u00ac\u25a1J then \u00acT, we can conclude that \u00acT (Tom did not watch football) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
