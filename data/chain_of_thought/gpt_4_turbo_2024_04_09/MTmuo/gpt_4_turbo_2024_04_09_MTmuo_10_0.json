In other words, the cat might have been inside.\n\n2. \"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. If the condition (the dog being inside) is true, then the result (the cat must have been outside) must also be true.\n\nGiven the first statement, we know that it is not necessarily true that the cat was outside. This contradicts the result of the second statement if the dog was inside (because if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside, which we know is not necessarily true).\n\nTherefore, since assuming the dog was inside leads to a contradiction with the first statement, the dog cannot have been inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
