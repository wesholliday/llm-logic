            "content": "To solve this, let's analyze the statements given:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This can be interpreted as Sue possibly not being at the wedding. It does not necessarily mean Sue was definitely not at the wedding, but rather that her presence is not mandatory.\n\n2. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This statement establishes a conditional relationship where Mary's attendance at the wedding guarantees Sue's attendance.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer the following:\n- If it is not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding, then there exists a possibility where Sue was not at the wedding.\n- If Sue was not at the wedding, based on the second statement, Mary could not have been at the wedding either, because Mary's presence would necessitate Sue's presence.\n\nTherefore, since it is established that Sue's presence is not mandatory (from statement 1), and Mary's attendance would make Sue's presence mandatory (from statement 2), we can conclude that Mary was not at the wedding to maintain the truth of the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
