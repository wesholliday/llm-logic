If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\n\nFrom statement 1, we understand that the book definitely is not a mystery novel. This is a negation of the necessity that the book is a mystery novel.\n\nStatement 2 establishes a conditional relationship: if James wrote the book, then the book is necessarily a mystery novel.\n\nGiven that we know from statement 1 that the book is not a mystery novel, we can use modus tollens, a form of logical argument which states that if \"P implies Q\" is true and \"Q is false,\" then \"P must also be false.\" Here, P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book must be a mystery novel.\"\n\nSince we know Q is false (the book is not a mystery novel), we can conclude that P is also false (the book was not written by James).\n\nAnswer: yes",
