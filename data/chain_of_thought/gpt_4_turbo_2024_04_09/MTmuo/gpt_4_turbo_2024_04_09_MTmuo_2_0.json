            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the statements given:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest\" implies that it is not necessarily true that the unicorn was in the forest. This can be interpreted as the unicorn might not have been in the forest.\n\n2. \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest\" establishes a conditional relationship where the presence of the griffin in the forest guarantees the presence of the unicorn in the forest.\n\nGiven these two statements, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n- If the griffin was in the forest, then according to statement 2, the unicorn must also have been in the forest. However, this contradicts statement 1, which asserts that it is not necessarily true that the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nTherefore, the only way to maintain consistency between these two statements is if the griffin was not in the forest. If the griffin was not in the forest, then there is no contradiction with the unicorn not necessarily being in the forest, as the condition requiring the unicorn's presence (the griffin being in the forest) did not occur.\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
