            "content": "To solve this, let's analyze the statements given:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as Mark possibly not buying the blue shirt.\n\n2. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. If the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the result (Mark must have bought the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\nGiven the first statement, we know that it is not necessarily true that Mark bought the blue shirt. This contradicts the result of the second statement if we assume its condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true. Since assuming Lisa bought the red shirt leads to a contradiction (Mark must have bought the blue shirt, which we know is not necessarily true), Lisa buying the red shirt cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, from these statements, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
