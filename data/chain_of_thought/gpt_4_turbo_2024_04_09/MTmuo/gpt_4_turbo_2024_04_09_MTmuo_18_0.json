            "content": "To solve this, let's break down the statements and use logical reasoning:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\" can be interpreted as the negation of the statement \"The truck must have been metal.\" Let's denote \"The truck must have been metal\" as T. So, we have \u00acT (not T).\n\n2. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" can be represented as a conditional statement. Let's denote \"The doll was plastic\" as D. The statement then becomes D \u2192 T (if D then T).\n\nGiven these representations:\n- \u00acT (the truck is not necessarily metal)\n- D \u2192 T (if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal)\n\nWe need to determine if these imply \u00acD (the doll was not plastic).\n\nFrom D \u2192 T, we know that if D is true, then T must be true. However, we know that \u00acT is true (the truck is not necessarily metal). Therefore, if T is false, D must also be false to maintain the truth of D \u2192 T. This is because a true conclusion (T) cannot follow from a false premise (D) in standard logic; thus, if T is false, D must also be false to avoid a logical contradiction.\n\nTherefore, given \u00acT and D \u2192 T, we can conclude \u00acD (the doll was not plastic).\n\nAnswer: yes",
