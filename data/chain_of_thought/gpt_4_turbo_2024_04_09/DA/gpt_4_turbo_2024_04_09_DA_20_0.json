            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the statements given:\n\n1. \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n2. \"The apple was not red.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be written in logical form as:\n\\[ P \\implies Q \\]\nwhere \\( P \\) is \"the apple was red\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\nThe second statement negates \\( P \\), stating:\n\\[ \\neg P \\]\nwhich means \"the apple was not red.\"\n\nFrom the structure of the conditional statement, we know that \\( P \\implies Q \\) is true if either \\( P \\) is false or both \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) are true. Since we know from the second statement that \\( P \\) (the apple was red) is false, the condition \\( P \\implies Q \\) holds true regardless of the truth value of \\( Q \\) (the banana was yellow).\n\nTherefore, knowing \\( \\neg P \\) (the apple was not red) does not provide any information about the truth value of \\( Q \\) (the banana was yellow). It could be either true or false. Thus, from the given statements, we cannot infer that \"The banana was not yellow.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
