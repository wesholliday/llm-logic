            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the statements given:\n\n1. \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n2. \"The vampire was not awake.\"\n\nThe first statement can be represented in logical form as:\n\\[ V \\implies M \\]\nwhere \\( V \\) represents \"the vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\nThe second statement tells us that \\( V \\) is false (\\( \\neg V \\)).\n\nFrom the implication \\( V \\implies M \\), we know that if \\( V \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must be true. However, if \\( V \\) is false, the implication \\( V \\implies M \\) does not provide any information about the truth value of \\( M \\). In logical terms, an implication is true if the antecedent (the part before the implication, here \\( V \\)) is false, regardless of the truth value of the consequent (the part after the implication, here \\( M \\)).\n\nSince \\( V \\) is false, the implication \\( V \\implies M \\) holds true regardless of whether \\( M \\) is true or false. Therefore, from the statements given, we cannot determine the truth value of \\( M \\). The mummy could be either awake or not awake based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
