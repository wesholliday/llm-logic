            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the statements given:\n\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n2. \"Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If P, then Q. Here, P represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe second statement tells us that P is false (\"Mary was not at the wedding\").\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is considered true either when both P and Q are true, or when P is false (regardless of the truth value of Q). Since we know P is false (Mary was not at the wedding), the conditional statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" holds true regardless of whether Sue was at the wedding or not.\n\nTherefore, from the information given (\"Mary was not at the wedding\"), we cannot definitively conclude whether Sue was at the wedding or not. The absence of Mary does not affect the presence of Sue based on the conditional statement provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
