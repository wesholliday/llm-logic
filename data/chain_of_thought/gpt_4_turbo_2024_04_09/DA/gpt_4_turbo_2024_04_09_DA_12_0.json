            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the statements given:\n\n1. \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This is a conditional statement which can be represented as: If P, then Q (where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo\").\n\n2. \"Joe did not go to the park.\" This is a negation of P, represented as not P.\n\nNow, we need to determine if from these two statements we can infer \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\" (not Q).\n\nThe conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" asserts that if the first part (P) is true, then the second part (Q) must also be true. However, it does not assert that if P is false (Joe did not go to the park), then Q must also be false (Lucy did not go to the zoo). The falsity of P does not necessarily imply the falsity of Q. Lucy could still go to the zoo for reasons unrelated to whether Joe went to the park or not.\n\nTherefore, from the statements given, we cannot logically infer that \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\" just because \"Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
