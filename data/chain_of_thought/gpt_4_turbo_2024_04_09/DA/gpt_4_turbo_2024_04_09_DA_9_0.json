            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the given statements.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as: If L (Lisa bought the red shirt), then M (Mark bought the blue shirt). In logical terms, this is L \u2192 M.\n\n2. The second statement tells us that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" This can be represented as \u00acL (not L).\n\n3. We need to determine whether these statements allow us to infer \u00acM (Mark did not buy the blue shirt).\n\nFrom the structure of a conditional statement (L \u2192 M), we know that it asserts that if the first part (L) is true, then the second part (M) must also be true. However, it does not necessarily state what happens if L is false. When L is false, M can be either true or false without contradicting the conditional statement. This is because a conditional statement is only false if the first part is true and the second part is false.\n\nGiven that Lisa did not buy the red shirt (\u00acL), the conditional statement L \u2192 M does not specify whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not. Mark could have bought the blue shirt or not, independent of Lisa's action, as the condition set by Lisa's action (L) being true did not occur.\n\nTherefore, from the information given, we cannot infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt just because Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
