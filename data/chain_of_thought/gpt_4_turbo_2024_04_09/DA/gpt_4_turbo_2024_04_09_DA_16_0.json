            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the given statements.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"The shirt was cotton\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The pants were denim.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The shirt was not cotton.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( \\neg P \\)\n   where \\( \\neg \\) denotes negation.\n\n3. We need to determine whether these statements imply \\( \\neg Q \\) (\"The pants were not denim\").\n\n4. From the rules of logic, specifically the truth table for a conditional statement, we know:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true if \\( P \\) is false, regardless of the truth value of \\( Q \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( \\neg P \\) (the shirt was not cotton) does not affect the truth value of \\( Q \\) (the pants were denim). The pants could be denim or not, independent of the shirt being cotton or not.\n\n5. Since \\( \\neg P \\) does not provide any information about \\( Q \\), we cannot infer \\( \\neg Q \\) from \\( \\neg P \\) and \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
