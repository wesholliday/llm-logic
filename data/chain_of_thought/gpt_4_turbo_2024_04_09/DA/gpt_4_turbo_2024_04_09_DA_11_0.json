            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the statements given:\n\n1. \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n2. \"The cake was not chocolate.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be written in logical form as:\n\\[ \\text{If } P \\text{ then } Q \\]\nwhere \\( P \\) represents \"the cake was chocolate\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nThe second statement negates \\( P \\), stating:\n\\[ \\neg P \\]\n(\"The cake was not chocolate.\")\n\nFrom the structure of the conditional statement, we know that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true. However, if \\( P \\) is false (as stated in the second statement), the conditional statement does not specify whether \\( Q \\) is true or false. The truth of \\( Q \\) is independent in this scenario because the condition \\( P \\) being true, which would guarantee \\( Q \\), is not met.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"The cake was not chocolate,\" we cannot infer anything about the truth value of \"The muffins were blueberry.\" The muffins could be blueberry or not, independent of the cake's flavor, based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
