However, it does not assert anything about the situation when A is false. When A is false (the alien did not visit Mars), B can either be true or false without contradicting the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"The alien did not visit Mars,\" we cannot conclude anything about whether \"The robot visited Jupiter\" is true or false. The truth of B (the robot visited Jupiter) is independent of the truth of A (the alien visited Mars) when A is false.\n\nAnswer: no",
