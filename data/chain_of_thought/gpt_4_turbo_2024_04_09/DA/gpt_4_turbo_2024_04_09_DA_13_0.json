            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the given statements.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" In logical terms, this can be written as: If P (the car was red), then Q (the truck was blue).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The car was not red.\" This is the negation of P, written as \u00acP.\n\nWe need to determine whether these statements allow us to infer \u00acQ (the truck was not blue).\n\nFrom the structure of the conditional statement (If P then Q), we know that if P is true, then Q must be true. However, if P is false (as it is in this case, since the car was not red), the conditional statement does not specify whether Q is true or false. The truth of Q is independent of P when P is false. This is a key characteristic of the implication in classical logic.\n\nSince we only know that P is false (the car was not red) and the conditional statement does not restrict the truth value of Q under these circumstances, we cannot conclude anything about the color of the truck based solely on these statements. The truck could be blue or not blue; both possibilities remain consistent with the given information.\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and \"The car was not red,\" we cannot infer \"The truck was not blue.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
