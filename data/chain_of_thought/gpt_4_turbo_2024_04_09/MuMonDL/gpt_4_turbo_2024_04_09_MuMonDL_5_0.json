            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package must have been delivered today\" asserts with certainty that the delivery of the package occurred today. This statement excludes the possibility of the package being delivered on any other day, including tomorrow. \n\nWhen considering the statement \"The package must have been delivered today or tomorrow,\" it suggests that there are two possible days for the delivery: today or tomorrow. This statement is broader and includes the possibility of the package being delivered today, which is consistent with the original statement, but it also adds an additional possibility (tomorrow) that is not supported by the original statement.\n\nSince the original statement definitively specifies that the delivery occurred today, adding an additional day (tomorrow) as a possibility does not align with the certainty expressed in the original statement. Therefore, the inference that the package could also have been delivered tomorrow is not supported by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
