            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The application must have been completed online\" explicitly specifies that the application process required online completion. This implies that the application was not only filled out online but also submitted through an online platform, as completing an application online generally encompasses both filling it out and submitting it through the same medium.\n\nThe phrase \"or submitted electronically\" in the proposed inference suggests an alternative method of submission, which could include other forms of electronic submission besides online, such as via email or other digital means. However, since the original statement specifies that the application must be completed online, it inherently includes the notion of electronic submission, as online completion is a form of electronic submission.\n\nTherefore, the inference that the application must have been completed online or submitted electronically does not add new information or alter the meaning of the original statement. It essentially restates part of what is already implied by saying the application was completed online, as online completion is a subset of electronic submission.\n\nAnswer: yes",
