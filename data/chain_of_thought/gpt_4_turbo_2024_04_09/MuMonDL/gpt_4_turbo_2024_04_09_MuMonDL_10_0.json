            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been signed\" asserts with certainty that the document has undergone the action of being signed. When considering the statement \"The document must have been signed or approved,\" this presents two possibilities for the document's status: it could either be signed or approved. Since being signed is one of the possibilities included in being \"signed or approved,\" the original statement that the document has been signed directly supports the broader statement that includes approval as an additional option. Therefore, if the document has definitely been signed, it also fits the criteria of having been either signed or approved.\n\nAnswer: yes",
