            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The event must have been formal\" explicitly indicates that the event had a formal dress code. The term \"formal\" in the context of events typically refers to a high standard of dress, such as suits and dresses. The phrase \"formal or black-tie\" suggests a choice between two levels of dress code: formal or even more formal (black-tie). Since black-tie is a subset of formal events, where black-tie is a specific type of formal dress code that is generally more strict and elaborate than general formal attire, the inclusion of \"or black-tie\" in the statement does not contradict or extend beyond the original assertion that the event was formal. Therefore, if an event is described as formal, it logically follows that it could also be described as \"formal or black-tie,\" because the latter category encompasses both possibilities without contradicting the initial statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
