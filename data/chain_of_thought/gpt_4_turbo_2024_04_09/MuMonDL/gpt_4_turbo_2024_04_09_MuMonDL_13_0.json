            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The movie must have been in English\" asserts that the movie was definitely in English. This implies that the language of the movie's dialogue was English. The expanded statement \"The movie must have been in English or had English subtitles\" suggests two possibilities: either the movie was in English, or it was in another language but had English subtitles. Since the original statement confirms that the movie was in English, it naturally fits within the broader condition of being either in English or having English subtitles. Therefore, if the movie was in English, it also meets the condition of being in English or having English subtitles.\n\nAnswer: yes",
