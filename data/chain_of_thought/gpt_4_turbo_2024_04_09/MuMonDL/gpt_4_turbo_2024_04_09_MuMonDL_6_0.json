            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The concert must have been sold out\" definitively indicates that all tickets for the concert were purchased and no tickets were available. The statement \"The concert must have been sold out or had limited tickets\" suggests two possibilities: either the concert was sold out or the number of tickets was limited. Since being sold out is one of the conditions explicitly covered in the second statement, the first statement (the concert being sold out) directly supports the second statement. Therefore, if the concert was sold out, it certainly fits within the scenario where the concert was either sold out or had limited tickets. Thus, the first statement implies the second.\n\nAnswer: yes",
