            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday\" sets a specific deadline for the completion of the project, which is Friday. This implies that the project needed to be finished no later than that day. \n\nWhen considering the extended statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday or next week,\" it suggests that the deadline could extend beyond Friday to the following week. This changes the original urgency and definitiveness of the deadline from just Friday to a broader timeframe that includes additional days beyond Friday.\n\nSince the original statement specifies Friday as the deadline, extending this deadline to include the next week would alter the initial requirement and meaning. Therefore, the statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday\" does not logically imply that it could also be completed by the next week without changing the original terms.\n\nAnswer: no",
