            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The meeting might be at 2 PM or cancelled\" suggests two possibilities: either the meeting will occur at 2 PM, or it will not occur at all because it is cancelled. The use of \"might\" indicates uncertainty but allows for the possibility that the meeting could indeed be at 2 PM. Therefore, from this statement, it is reasonable to infer that there is a possibility of the meeting being at 2 PM, as this is directly stated as one of the options.\n\nAnswer: yes",
