            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package might be delivered today or tomorrow\" suggests that there are two possibilities for the delivery of the package: today or tomorrow. The use of \"might\" indicates uncertainty but allows for the possibility of the event occurring on either of the two days mentioned. Since today is included as one of the potential options for delivery, it is logically consistent to infer that there is a possibility of the package being delivered today. Therefore, from the statement given, it is reasonable to infer that \"The package might be delivered today.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
