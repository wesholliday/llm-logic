            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document might be signed or notarized\" suggests two possibilities for the status of the document: it might be signed, or it might be notarized. The use of \"or\" in this context does not necessarily imply exclusivity; it simply presents multiple possibilities. Therefore, if the document might be signed or notarized, it is indeed possible that the document might be signed. This is a direct inference from the given statement, as the possibility of the document being signed is explicitly mentioned.\n\nAnswer: yes",
