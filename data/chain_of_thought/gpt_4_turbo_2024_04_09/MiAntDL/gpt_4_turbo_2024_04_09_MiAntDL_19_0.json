The use of \"or\" in this context indicates that either of the options is viable. Therefore, if it is stated that the application might be completed online or in person, it inherently includes the possibility that the application might be completed online. This is a direct inference from the given statement without adding any additional information or assumptions.\n\nAnswer: yes",
