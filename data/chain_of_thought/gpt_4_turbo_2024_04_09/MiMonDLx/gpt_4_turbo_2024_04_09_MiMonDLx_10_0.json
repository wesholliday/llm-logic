            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The snork might be plonk\" suggests a possibility that the snork is plonk. When considering the statement \"The snork might be plonk or wobble,\" this introduces an additional possibility (wobble) alongside the original possibility (plonk). In logical terms, if it is possible that \"A\" is true, then it is also possible that \"A or B\" is true, because the addition of more possibilities (B in this case) does not negate the original possibility of A. Therefore, if it is possible that the snork is plonk, it is also possible that the snork is either plonk or wobble.\n\nAnswer: yes",
