            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The zibber might be froodle\" suggests a possibility that the zibber is froodle. When considering the statement \"The zibber might be froodle or on wibble,\" this introduces an additional possibility (being on wibble) to the original possibility of the zibber being froodle. In logical terms, if something might be A (froodle), then it certainly might be A or B (froodle or on wibble), because the addition of more options (B, or being on wibble) does not negate the original possibility of A and only expands the range of possibilities. Therefore, if it is possible that the zibber is froodle, it is also possible that the zibber is either froodle or on wibble.\n\nAnswer: yes",
