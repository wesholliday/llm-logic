The difficulty of an exam can depend on various factors such as the complexity of the chapters, the depth of questions, the student's preparation, and the grading criteria, none of which are specified in the original statement. Therefore, adding that the exam \"might be difficult\" introduces an assumption that is not supported by the original statement alone. \n\nAnswer: no",
