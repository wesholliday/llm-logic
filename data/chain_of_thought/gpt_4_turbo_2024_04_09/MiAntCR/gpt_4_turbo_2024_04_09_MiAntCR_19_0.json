The addition of \"might be completed online\" introduces a new, unrelated aspect about the application's completion method that is not supported or implied by the original statement. Without additional information linking the application's inclusion of references to being completed online, we cannot logically infer that both conditions might be true based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
