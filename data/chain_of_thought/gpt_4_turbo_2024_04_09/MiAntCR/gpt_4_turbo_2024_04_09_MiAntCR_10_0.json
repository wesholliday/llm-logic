            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document might be notarized\" implies that there is a possibility that the document has undergone the process of notarization. Notarization typically involves a notary public who verifies the identity of the signers, witnesses their signatures, and marks the document with a stamp or seal to indicate that it has been notarized. For a document to be notarized, it generally must be signed first because the notary needs to witness the signing. Therefore, if a document might be notarized, it inherently suggests that it might also be signed, as signing is a prerequisite for notarization.\n\nAnswer: yes",
