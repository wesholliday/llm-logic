The addition of \"today\" in the statement \"The package might be delivered today and signed for\" introduces a specific time frame. The original statement does not provide any information about the timing of the delivery or the signing, so we cannot infer that the package might be delivered and signed for specifically today based on the original statement alone. The original statement only addresses the possibility of the package being signed for at some unspecified time.\n\nAnswer: no",
