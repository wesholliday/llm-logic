            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The application must have been completed online\" explicitly specifies that the application process is restricted to being completed online. This implies that completing the application in any other way, such as in person, is not acceptable or possible according to the statement provided. \n\nWhen considering the statement \"The application must have been completed in person or online,\" it suggests that there are two acceptable methods for completing the application: either in person or online. This is a broader condition than the original statement, which limits the completion method to only online.\n\nTherefore, if the original statement restricts the completion to being online only, it contradicts the idea that it could also be completed in person. Thus, we cannot infer that the application could be completed in person from the statement that it must be completed online.\n\nAnswer: no",
