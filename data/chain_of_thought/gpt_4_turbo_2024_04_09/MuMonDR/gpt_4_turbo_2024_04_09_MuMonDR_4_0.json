            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The meeting must have been scheduled for 2 PM\" asserts with certainty that the meeting was scheduled for 2 PM. This is a definitive statement about the timing of the meeting.\n\nThe second statement, \"The meeting must have been cancelled or scheduled for 2 PM,\" presents two possibilities: either the meeting was cancelled, or it was scheduled for 2 PM. This statement is broader because it includes the possibility of the meeting being cancelled in addition to the possibility of it being scheduled for 2 PM.\n\nSince the first statement confirms that the meeting was definitely scheduled for 2 PM, it inherently satisfies one of the conditions of the second statement (that the meeting was scheduled for 2 PM). Therefore, knowing that the meeting was scheduled for 2 PM does allow us to infer that it was either cancelled or scheduled for 2 PM, because the condition of being scheduled for 2 PM is met.\n\nAnswer: yes",
