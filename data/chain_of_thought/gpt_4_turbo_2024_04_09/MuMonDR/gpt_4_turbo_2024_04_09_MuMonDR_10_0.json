            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been signed\" asserts with certainty that the document has undergone the action of signing. When considering the statement \"The document must have been notarized or signed,\" we are presented with two possibilities for the document: it has either been notarized or it has been signed, or both. \n\nThe logical relationship here involves understanding the inclusive nature of the conjunction \"or\" in logic. \"Or\" is inclusive, meaning that if at least one of the conditions is true, then the statement is true. Since we already know from the original statement that the document has definitely been signed, this satisfies one of the conditions of the second statement (\"signed\"). \n\nTherefore, regardless of the notarization status of the document, the truth of it being signed fulfills the requirement of the statement \"The document must have been notarized or signed.\" Thus, we can infer that if the document has been signed, it certainly meets the criteria of having been \"notarized or signed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
