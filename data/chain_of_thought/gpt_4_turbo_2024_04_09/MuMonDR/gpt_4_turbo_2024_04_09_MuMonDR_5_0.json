            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package must have been delivered today\" asserts with certainty that the delivery of the package occurred today. This statement is specific about the timing of the delivery, leaving no ambiguity about when it happened.\n\nWhen considering the statement \"The package must have been delivered tomorrow or today,\" it suggests a possibility that the delivery could occur either today or tomorrow. This statement is broader because it includes an additional day (tomorrow) as a possibility for the delivery.\n\nSince the original statement definitively places the delivery on today, it is logically consistent with the broader statement that includes both today and tomorrow as possibilities. If the package was definitely delivered today, it is also true to say it was delivered today or tomorrow, because today is included in the timeframe of \"today or tomorrow.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
