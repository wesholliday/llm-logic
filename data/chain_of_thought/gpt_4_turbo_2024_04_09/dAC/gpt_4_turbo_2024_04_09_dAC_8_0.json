            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship given by the statements:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n2. The mummy was awake.\n\nThe first statement can be written in logical form as:\n\\[ V \\implies M \\]\nwhere \\( V \\) represents \"the vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the mummy was awake\".\n\nThe second statement is simply:\n\\[ M \\]\n\nWe are asked to deduce whether \\( V \\) (the vampire was awake) is true based on these statements.\n\nThe logical implication \\( V \\implies M \\) means that if \\( V \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must be true. However, it does not mean that if \\( M \\) is true, then \\( V \\) must be true. The truth of \\( M \\) does not necessarily imply the truth of \\( V \\); \\( M \\) could be true whether \\( V \\) is true or not.\n\nGiven that \\( M \\) is true, we cannot directly conclude \\( V \\) is true because the implication does not work backwards. There could be other reasons why \\( M \\) is true that do not involve \\( V \\) being true.\n\nTherefore, from the statements provided, we cannot deduce that the vampire was awake just because the mummy was awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
