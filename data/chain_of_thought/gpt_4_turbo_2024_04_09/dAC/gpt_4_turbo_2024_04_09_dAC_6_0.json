However, the original conditional statement \"If P then Q\" does not necessarily mean that \"If Q then P\". This is a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. Just because the consequent (Q) is true, it does not mean the antecedent (P) must also be true. There could be other reasons why Bob chose pasta that are not related to whether Sue chose pizza.\n\nTherefore, from the statements given, we cannot logically deduce that Sue chose pizza just because Bob chose pasta.\n\nAnswer: no",
