This is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" The fallacy occurs because even though Q is true, there could be other reasons for Q being true besides P being true. In other words, just because the consequent (Q) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (P) must also be true.\n\nThus, from the statements given:\n- \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" (If P then Q)\n- \"Erin took a train\" (Q)\n\nWe cannot logically deduce that:\n- \"Sam took a plane\" (P)\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether we can deduce that Sam took a plane based solely on these statements is:\n\nAnswer: no",
