            "content": "To analyze the logical relationship in the question, we start by understanding the given statements:\n\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be represented as: If M, then S.\n2. \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This is simply: S.\n\nThe question asks if from these statements, we can deduce \"Mary was at the wedding\" (M).\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that Mary being at the wedding guarantees that Sue was also there. However, it does not state that if Sue is at the wedding, then Mary must be there. This is a one-way implication, not a bi-directional one.\n\nThe second statement confirms that Sue was indeed at the wedding. However, this does not provide any direct information about Mary's presence. The presence of Sue does not logically necessitate Mary's presence because the original statement does not imply that Sue's presence depends on Mary's presence.\n\nThus, from the given information, we cannot logically deduce that Mary was at the wedding just because Sue was there. The reasoning only allows us to conclude that if Mary was there, then Sue would definitely be there, but not the reverse.\n\nAnswer: no",
