The original statement only indicates that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants will definitely be denim, but it does not state that the pants being denim is exclusively caused by the shirt being cotton.\n\nTherefore, from the information given, we cannot logically deduce that the shirt was cotton just because the pants were denim.\n\nAnswer: no",
