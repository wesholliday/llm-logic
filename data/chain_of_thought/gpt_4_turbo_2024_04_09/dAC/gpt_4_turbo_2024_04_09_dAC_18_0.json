This is known as affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. Just because the consequent (Q) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (P) is true. There could be other reasons why Q is true that do not involve P being true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot logically deduce that \"The doll was plastic\" just because \"The truck was metal.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
