            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The zooble must be zibber for a blimple and wump\" implies that the condition of the zooble being zibber is necessary for both a blimple and a wump. This suggests that the zooble being zibber is a requirement that applies when considering either a blimple alone or a wump alone, as well as the combination of both. Therefore, if the zooble must be zibber for the combination of a blimple and a wump, it logically follows that the zooble must be zibber for a blimple independently of the wump.\n\nAnswer: yes",
