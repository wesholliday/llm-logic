            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The glorp must be on the quank and wobble a plonk snork\" implies two conditions: 1) The glorp must be on the quank, and 2) The glorp must wobble a plonk snork. The use of \"and\" in the sentence connects these two conditions, indicating that both are required. Since the first part of the statement explicitly states that \"The glorp must be on the quank,\" we can infer this as a standalone fact regardless of the additional information about wobbling a plonk snork. Therefore, the inference that \"The glorp must be on the quank\" is directly supported by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
