    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a garplex, a beelhet, and a peedonk are competing to be domer of the year. Experts think the garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, with the peedonk having a much lower chance. Since these are the only domer candidates, if the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer. Moreover, it is likely the garplex will become domer and hence the beelhet likely won\u2019t become domer. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will?",

            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the likelihoods and implications given in the scenario:\n\n1. The garplex is most likely to win the title of domer of the year.\n2. The beelhet is the second most likely to win.\n3. The peedonk has a much lower chance compared to the other two.\n\nGiven these likelihoods, we can infer the following:\n- If the garplex does not become domer, then the next most likely candidate, according to the given information, is the beelhet.\n\nHowever, the scenario also states:\n- If the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer.\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n- If the garplex doesn\u2019t win, we then consider the likelihood of the beelhet winning. If the beelhet also doesn\u2019t win, then the peedonk will win by default as they are the only three candidates.\n\nThe question asks if it is likely that if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will. To determine this, consider:\n- The likelihood of the garplex not becoming domer is low since it is stated that it is likely the garplex will win.\n- If the garplex doesn\u2019t win, the next likely candidate is the beelhet, not the peedonk.\n\nThus, for the peedonk to win:\n- Both the garplex and the beelhet must not win. Given that the beelhet is more likely to win than the peedonk if the garplex doesn\u2019t win, the likelihood of both the garplex and beelhet not winning is lower than the likelihood of at least one of them winning.\n\nTherefore, it is not likely that if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will, because the beelhet still has a higher chance than the peedonk in that scenario.\n\nAnswer: no",
