The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and the implications of the scenario:\n\n1. There are three applicants for one open zulision: a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect.\n2. The jantiz is the most qualified, followed by the cramen, and then the sulect, who has the weakest qualifications.\n3. The jantiz is likely to get the zulision, which implies that the cramen is unlikely to get it.\n4. If neither the jantiz nor the cramen gets the zulision, then the sulect will get it, as these are the only three applicants.\n\nGiven that the jantiz is the most likely to get the zulision, we need to consider the scenario where the jantiz does not get the zulision. In this case, the decision would be between the cramen and the sulect. Since the cramen is more qualified than the sulect, it follows that the cramen would be the next likely candidate to get the zulision if the jantiz does not.\n\nTherefore, if the jantiz does not get the zulision, it is more likely that the cramen will get it rather than the sulect, given the relative qualifications and the initial likelihoods provided.\n\nThus, it does not follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will.\n\nAnswer: no",
