            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical form of the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise is: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be represented in logical form as:\nP \u2192 Q\n\nThe conclusion is: \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\" This can be represented in logical form as:\n\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\n\nThe question is whether the truth of P \u2192 Q necessarily implies the truth of \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ. This is a question of whether the contrapositive of the original statement is equivalent to the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. This is logically equivalent to the original statement (P \u2192 Q). However, the conclusion given in the argument is \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, which is not the contrapositive of the original statement but rather the inverse of the original statement.\n\nThe inverse of a statement (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ) is not logically equivalent to the original statement (P \u2192 Q). The truth of one does not guarantee the truth of the other. For example, if P is false and Q is true, P \u2192 Q is true (since a false hypothesis leads to a true conclusion in material implication), but \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ is false (since the hypothesis \u00acP is true but the conclusion \u00acQ is false).\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
