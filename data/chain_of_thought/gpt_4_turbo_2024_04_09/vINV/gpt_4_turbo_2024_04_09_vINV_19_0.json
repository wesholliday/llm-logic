            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise given is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" In logical form, this can be written as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) represents \"Tom watched football\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThe conclusion presented is another conditional statement: \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), where \\( \\neg P \\) represents \"Tom did not watch football\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) represents \"Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n\nThe argument is asserting that the truth of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (the premise) implies the truth of \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) (the conclusion). This form of argument is known as denying the antecedent. We need to check if this form is valid by considering whether it's possible for the premise to be true while the conclusion is false.\n\nLet's consider a situation where:\n- \\( P \\) is true (Tom watched football)\n- \\( Q \\) is true (Jen watched basketball)\n\nIn this case, the premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true because both \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) are true.\n\nNow, let's check the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\):\n- \\( \\neg P \\) is false (since Tom did watch football)\n- \\( \\neg Q \\) is false (since Jen did watch basketball)\n\nSince \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) involves a false antecedent, the conclusion is vacuously true in this specific case. However, we need to test a case where \\( \\neg P \\) is true to properly evaluate the conclusion.\n\nConsider a different situation where:\n- \\( P \\) is false (Tom did not watch football)\n- \\( Q \\) is true (Jen watched basketball)\n\nHere, the premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is still true because a false antecedent (\\( P \\)) makes the conditional statement true regardless of the truth value of \\( Q \\).\n\nHowever, the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) would be:\n- \\( \\neg P \\) is true (Tom did not watch football)\n- \\( \\neg Q \\) is false (Jen did watch basketball)\n\nThus, the conclusion is false because the antecedent is true and the consequent is false.\n\nSince it's possible for the premise to be true while the conclusion is false, the argument form is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
