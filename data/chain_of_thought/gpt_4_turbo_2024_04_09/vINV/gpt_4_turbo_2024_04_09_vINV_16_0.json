            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise given is: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where:\n- \\( P \\) represents \"the shirt was cotton\"\n- \\( Q \\) represents \"the pants were denim\"\n\nThe conclusion given is: \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nThe argument is asserting that the truth of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (if P then Q) implies the truth of \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) (if not P then not Q). This is a form of logical inference known as denying the antecedent or inverse error. \n\nTo check the validity, consider a situation where the premise is true but the conclusion is false. If \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, it means whenever \\( P \\) is true, \\( Q \\) must also be true. However, \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) states that whenever \\( P \\) is false, \\( Q \\) must also be false. \n\nConsider a case where:\n- The shirt is not cotton (\\( \\neg P \\))\n- The pants are still denim (\\( Q \\))\n\nIn this scenario, the premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) holds because it only concerns cases where \\( P \\) is true. However, the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) does not hold because \\( \\neg P \\) is true but \\( \\neg Q \\) is false. This shows a situation where the premise is true, but the conclusion is false, indicating that the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
