            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise given is: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where:\n- \\( P \\) represents \"the car was red\"\n- \\( Q \\) represents \"the truck was blue\"\n\nThe conclusion given is: \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nThe argument is asserting that \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) implies \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\). This is a form of logical inference known as denying the antecedent, which is generally a logical fallacy. The correct logical inference from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) would be \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) (modus tollens), not \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nTo further illustrate why \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not imply \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), consider a scenario where:\n- \\( P \\) is false (the car was not red)\n- \\( Q \\) is true (the truck was blue)\n\nIn this scenario, the premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true because a conditional statement is true if the antecedent is false. However, the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is false because \\( \\neg P \\) is true (the car was not red) but \\( \\neg Q \\) is false (the truck was blue).\n\nSince there exists a scenario where the premise is true and the conclusion is false, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
