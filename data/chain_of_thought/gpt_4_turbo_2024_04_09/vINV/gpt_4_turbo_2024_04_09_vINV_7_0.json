            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise given is: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( A \\rightarrow C \\), where \\( A \\) represents \"Alex finished the race\" and \\( C \\) represents \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\nThe conclusion drawn is: \"If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg C \\).\n\nThe argument is asserting that the truth of \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) (if Alex finishes, then Chris finishes) implies the truth of \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) (if Alex does not finish, then Chris does not finish). This is a form of logical inference known as contraposition.\n\nIn classical logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) is \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg A \\), which states \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\nHowever, the conclusion given in the argument is \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg C \\), not \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg A \\). The conclusion \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) is not the contrapositive of the premise \\( A \\rightarrow C \\); rather, it is the inverse of the premise. The inverse of a statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the validity of the argument depends on whether the inverse holds true under the same conditions as the original statement, which is not guaranteed in classical logic.\n\nThus, the argument is not valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise based on the rules of classical logic.\n\nAnswer: no",
