            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise under all possible circumstances.\n\nThe premise given is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue. shirt\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where:\n- \\( P \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\"\n- \\( Q \\) represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt\"\n\nThe conclusion given is another conditional statement: \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nThe argument is asserting that \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) implies \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\). This is a form of argument known as denying the antecedent, which is a logical fallacy. The fallacy occurs because the truth of the first condition (Lisa buying the red shirt leads to Mark buying the blue shirt) does not logically dictate that the non-occurrence of the first condition (Lisa not buying the red shirt) must lead to the non-occurrence of the second condition (Mark not buying the blue shirt). \n\nFor example, it's possible that Mark could buy the blue shirt regardless of whether Lisa buys the red shirt or not, due to other reasons not stated in the premise. Thus, the truth of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not guarantee the truth of \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
