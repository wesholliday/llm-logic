            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise given is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be represented in logical form as:\n\\[ P \\rightarrow Q \\]\nwhere \\( P \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe conclusion drawn is: \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\" This can be represented as:\n\\[ \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\]\n\nThe argument is asserting that the truth of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (if P then Q) implies the truth of \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) (if not P then not Q). This form of argument is known as denying the antecedent, which is a logical fallacy. The truth of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not logically guarantee the truth of \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nFor example, if it is true that \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" it does not necessarily follow that if Mary was not at the wedding, Sue was not at the wedding. Sue might still have attended the wedding regardless of whether Mary did.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the truth of the premise does not ensure the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
