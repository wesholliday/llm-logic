            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise given is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" In logical form, this can be written as:\nP \u2192 Q\nwhere P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nThe conclusion drawn from this premise is another conditional statement: \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\" In logical form, this can be written as:\n\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\nwhere \u00acP is \"Jeff did not play basketball\" and \u00acQ is \"Amy did not play tennis.\"\n\nThe argument is asserting that the truth of P \u2192 Q implies the truth of \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ. This form of argument is known as denying the antecedent. We need to check if this form is a valid logical inference.\n\nTo test the validity, consider a situation where the premise is true but the conclusion is false. If such a situation exists, the argument is invalid.\n\nAssume P \u2192 Q is true (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis). Now, consider a case where Jeff did not play basketball (\u00acP is true). According to the premise, we know nothing about Amy's tennis playing from Jeff not playing basketball; Amy might still play tennis regardless of Jeff's basketball playing. Therefore, it's possible for \u00acP to be true (Jeff did not play basketball) and Q to be true (Amy played tennis) simultaneously.\n\nIn this scenario, the premise (P \u2192 Q) is true, but the conclusion (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ) is false because \u00acP is true and \u00acQ is false (Amy did play tennis). This shows that the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise, indicating that the argument form is invalid.\n\nAnswer: no",
