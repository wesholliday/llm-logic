            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" In logical form, this can be written as:\n\\[ P \\rightarrow Q \\]\nwhere \\( P \\) represents \"the cake was chocolate\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nThe conclusion is another conditional statement: \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\" This can be written as:\n\\[ \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\]\nwhere \\( \\neg P \\) represents \"the cake was not chocolate\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) represents \"the muffins were not blueberry.\"\n\nThe argument is asserting that the truth of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) implies the truth of \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\). This is a form of argument known as denying the antecedent, which is a logical fallacy. The fallacy occurs because the truth of the original conditional statement does not logically guarantee the truth of the inverse conditional statement.\n\nTo see why this is a fallacy, consider a situation where the cake was not chocolate, but the muffins were still blueberry. This situation would make \\( \\neg P \\) true and \\( Q \\) true, which means \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) would be false, even though \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) could still be true. Thus, the truth of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not ensure the truth of \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
