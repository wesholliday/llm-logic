            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise given is: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be symbolically represented as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where:\n- \\( P \\) represents \"the apple was red\"\n- \\( Q \\) represents \"the banana was yellow\"\n\nThe conclusion given is: \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\" This can be symbolically represented as: \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nThe argument is asserting that the truth of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (if P then Q) implies the truth of \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) (if not P then not Q). This is a form of logical inference known as denying the antecedent, which is generally considered a logical fallacy.\n\nTo see why, consider a situation where both the premise and the conclusion are evaluated:\n- Suppose the premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true. This means whenever the apple is red, the banana is yellow.\n- Now, consider the truth of \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) under the assumption that \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true. If the apple is not red (\\( \\neg P \\)), the premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not provide any information about the color of the banana. The banana could still be yellow or not yellow regardless of the apple's color. Thus, \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) (if the apple is not red, then the banana is not yellow) does not necessarily follow from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise, making the argument invalid.\n\nAnswer: no",
