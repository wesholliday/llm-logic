            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nThe premise given is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where:\n- \\( P \\) is \"the book was written by James\"\n- \\( Q \\) is \"the book is a mystery novel\"\n\nThe conclusion drawn is another conditional statement: \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), where:\n- \\( \\neg P \\) is \"the book was not written by James\"\n- \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"the book is not a mystery novel\"\n\nThe argument is asserting that the truth of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) implies the truth of \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\). This is a form of logical inference known as denying the antecedent or the inverse error. The validity of this inference can be checked through truth table analysis or understanding logical equivalences.\n\nIn logic, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not imply \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\). The truth of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) only means that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true; it does not say anything about the situation where \\( P \\) is false. When \\( P \\) is false, \\( Q \\) can either be true or false without affecting the truth of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) does not necessarily follow from the premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). The argument commits a logical fallacy by assuming that the falsity of the antecedent (\\( P \\)) implies the falsity of the consequent (\\( Q \\)), which is not supported by the rules of logic.\n\nAnswer: no",
