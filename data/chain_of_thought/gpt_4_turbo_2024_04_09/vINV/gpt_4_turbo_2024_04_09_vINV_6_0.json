            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" In logical form, this can be written as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) represents \"Sue chose pizza\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\nThe conclusion is another conditional statement: \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\" This can be written as \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), where \\( \\neg P \\) represents \"Sue did not choose pizza\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) represents \"Bob did not choose pasta.\"\n\nThe argument is asserting that \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) implies \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\). This is a form of argument known as denying the antecedent, which is a logical fallacy. The fallacy occurs because the truth of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not necessarily determine the truth of \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nTo see why, consider a situation where both \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) are false. For example, Sue did not choose pizza, and Bob did not choose pasta. In this case, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true (since a false statement implies anything), but \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is also true, which does not contradict our analysis but does not support the general validity either.\n\nHowever, if we consider a situation where \\( P \\) is false and \\( Q \\) is true (Sue did not choose pizza, but Bob chose pasta), \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) remains true (since a false statement implies anything), but \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is false (since the antecedent is true and the consequent is false). This shows that the truth of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not guarantee the truth of \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the truth of the premise does not ensure the truth of the conclusion in all possible scenarios.\n\nAnswer: no",
