The first statement can be rewritten in logical terms as \u00ac\u25a1G (where \u25a1G means \"Fido must be in the garden\"). This statement asserts that it is not necessarily the case that Fido is in the garden.\n\n2. The second statement can be represented as \u25a1G \u2228 I (where I means \"Fido is inside\"). This is a logical disjunction stating that either Fido must be in the garden, or Fido is inside.\n\nGiven that the first statement, \u00ac\u25a1G, is true, it negates the possibility of \u25a1G being true. Therefore, in the disjunction \u25a1G \u2228 I, since \u25a1G is false, I must be true for the disjunction itself to be true.\n\nThus, from the truth of \u00ac\u25a1G and the disjunction \u25a1G \u2228 I, we can infer that I (Fido is inside) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
