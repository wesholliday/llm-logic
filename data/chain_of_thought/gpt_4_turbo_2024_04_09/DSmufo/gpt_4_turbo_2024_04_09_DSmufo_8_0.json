Therefore, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nSince the first statement negates the possibility of the remote being under the couch, and the second statement offers only one other location (on the coffee table), we can conclude that the remote control must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
