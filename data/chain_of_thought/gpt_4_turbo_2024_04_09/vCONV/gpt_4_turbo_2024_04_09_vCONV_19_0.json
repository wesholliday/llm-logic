            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise under all possible circumstances.\n\nThe premise of the argument is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" In logical form, this can be represented as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Tom watched football\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Jen watched basketball\".\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is another conditional statement: \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football.\" This can be represented as \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\).\n\nThe question is whether \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) logically implies \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\). This would mean that the truth of \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" guarantees the truth of \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football\".\n\nTo test this, consider the truth table for \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\):\n\n1. If \\( P \\) is true and \\( Q \\) is true, then \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true and \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\) is true.\n2. If \\( P \\) is true and \\( Q \\) is false, then \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is false (so the premise is false and the conclusion's truth value doesn't matter in this case).\n3. If \\( P \\) is false and \\( Q \\) is true, then \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true (since a false antecedent makes the implication true), but \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\) is false (since the antecedent is true but the consequent is false).\n4. If \\( P \\) is false and \\( Q \\) is false, then both \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\) are true (since a false antecedent makes the implication true).\n\nFrom the truth table, we see that there is a scenario (case 3) where the premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, but the conclusion \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\) is false. This indicates that the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
