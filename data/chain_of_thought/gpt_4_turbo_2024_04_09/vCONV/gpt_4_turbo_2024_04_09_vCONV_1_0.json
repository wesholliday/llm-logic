            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise given is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe conclusion given is: \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\).\n\nThe question is whether \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) logically implies \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\). This involves checking if the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nIn logic, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not imply \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\). The implication \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) means that whenever \\( P \\) is true, \\( Q \\) must also be true. However, it does not mean that whenever \\( Q \\) is true, \\( P \\) must also be true. For example, it could be that Sue was at the wedding for reasons unrelated to Mary's attendance, which would make \\( Q \\) true without \\( P \\) being true.\n\nTherefore, the argument \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding; therefore, if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\" is not logically valid because the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
