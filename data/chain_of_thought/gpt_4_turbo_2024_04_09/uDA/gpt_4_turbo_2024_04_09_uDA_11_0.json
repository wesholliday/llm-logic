Here, P represents \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q represents \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nThe additional information provided is that the cake was not chocolate, which means P is false.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is considered false only if P is true and Q is false. In all other cases, including when P is false (regardless of the truth value of Q), the conditional statement is considered true.\n\nSince we know P is false (the cake was not chocolate), the conditional statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" does not provide any information about the truth value of Q when P is false. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the truth value of Q (whether the muffins were blueberry or not) based solely on the falsity of P.\n\nAnswer: no",
