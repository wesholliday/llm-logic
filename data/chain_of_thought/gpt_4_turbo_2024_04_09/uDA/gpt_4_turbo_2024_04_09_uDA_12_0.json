It can be symbolically represented as \\( J \\rightarrow L \\), where \\( J \\) is \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( L \\) is \"Lucy went to the zoo\".\n\nThe additional information provided is that Joe did not go to the park, represented as \\( \\neg J \\).\n\nThe question asks whether from these premises we can infer \\( \\neg L \\) (Lucy did not go to the zoo).\n\nIn logic, the truth of a conditional statement \\( J \\rightarrow L \\) means that if \\( J \\) is true, then \\( L \\) must be true. However, if \\( J \\) is false (\\( \\neg J \\)), the conditional statement \\( J \\rightarrow L \\) does not specify whether \\( L \\) is true or false. \\( L \\) could be either true or false without affecting the truth of the conditional statement \\( J \\rightarrow L \\).\n\nTherefore, from the fact that Joe did not go to the park (\\( \\neg J \\)), we cannot infer whether Lucy went to the zoo or not (\\( L \\) or \\( \\neg L \\)). Lucy could still have gone to the zoo for reasons unrelated to whether Joe went to the park.\n\nAnswer: no",
