            "content": "The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is a conditional statement. It can be represented as: If P, then Q. Here, P represents \"Tom watched football\" and Q represents \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThe statement also mentions that \"Tom did not watch football.\" This is the negation of P, represented as not P.\n\nThe question asks whether we can infer that Jen did not watch basketball, which is not Q.\n\nIn logic, the truth of a conditional statement (If P, then Q) does not allow us to infer the truth of its converse (If not P, then not Q). The original statement only specifies what happens if P is true. It does not specify what happens if P is false.\n\nSince we only know that P is false (Tom did not watch football), we cannot logically infer the truth value of Q (whether Jen watched basketball or not) based solely on the given conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Jen did not watch basketball just because Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: no",
