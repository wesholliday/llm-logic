However, if P is false, the conditional statement \"If P then Q\" does not specify the truth value of Q; Q can be either true or false without affecting the truth of the conditional statement.\n\nSince the griffin was not in the forest, we only know that the condition for the unicorn being in the forest (based on the griffin's presence) was not met. This does not provide information about the unicorn's presence or absence independently of the griffin. Therefore, we cannot infer the location of the unicorn based solely on the absence of the griffin.\n\nAnswer: no",
