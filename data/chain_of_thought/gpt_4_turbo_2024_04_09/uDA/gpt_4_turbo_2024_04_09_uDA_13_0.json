            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications given in the statements:\n\n1. \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\n2. \"The car was not red.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement. It can be written in logical form as:\n\\[ \\text{Car is red} \\implies \\text{Truck is blue} \\]\n\nThe second statement tells us that the premise of the conditional statement (\"Car is red\") is false.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically the truth table for a conditional statement, if the premise (the \"if\" part) of a conditional statement is false, the entire conditional statement is true regardless of the truth value of the conclusion (the \"then\" part). This is sometimes referred to as \"vacuously true.\"\n\nSince the premise (\"Car is red\") is false, the conditional statement does not provide any information about the color of the truck when the car is not red. The truck could be blue or not blue, and it would not affect the truth of the original conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer that the truck was not blue. The truth of the truck being blue or not is independent of the information given (since the car was not red).\n\nAnswer: no",
