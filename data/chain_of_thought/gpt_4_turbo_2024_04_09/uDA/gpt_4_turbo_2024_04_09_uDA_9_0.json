            "content": "The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement. It can be represented as: If P, then Q. Here, P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe statement also mentions that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" This means that P is false.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is considered false only if P is true and Q is false. If P is false, the conditional statement does not specify whether Q must be true or false. Therefore, the truth value of Q (whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not) is independent of the truth value of P when P is false.\n\nSince Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we cannot infer anything about whether Mark bought the blue shirt based solely on the given conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
