In logical terms, this is V \u2192 M.\n\n2. \"The vampire was not awake.\" This is represented as \u00acV (not V).\n\nWe need to determine if these statements allow us to infer \u00acM (the mummy was not awake).\n\nFrom the statement V \u2192 M, we know that if V is true, then M must be true. However, if V is false (which it is, as given by \u00acV), the implication V \u2192 M does not provide information about the state of M. M could be either true or false without affecting the truth of V \u2192 M when V is false. This is because an implication is only false if the premise is true and the conclusion is false; all other combinations (including false premise with either true or false conclusion) render the implication true.\n\nSince we only know \u00acV (the vampire was not awake) and have no additional information about the mummy's state directly, we cannot conclude \u00acM (the mummy was not awake) based solely on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
