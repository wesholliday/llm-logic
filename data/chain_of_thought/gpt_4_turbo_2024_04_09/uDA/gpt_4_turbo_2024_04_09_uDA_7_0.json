However, if \\( A \\) is false, the conditional statement does not specify whether \\( C \\) is true or false. The truth of \\( C \\) is independent in this scenario because the condition for \\( C \\) to necessarily be true (which is \\( A \\) being true) is not met.\n\nSince \\( A \\) is false, we cannot infer anything about \\( C \\) based solely on the given statements. Chris could either have finished the race or not, but this information is not determined by the truth value of \\( A \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
