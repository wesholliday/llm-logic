            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the statements given:\n\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n2. \"Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement. It can be represented as: If M (Mary was at the wedding), then S (Sue was at the wedding). This statement tells us about a condition where Sue's attendance is dependent on Mary's attendance.\n\nThe second statement tells us that Mary was not at the wedding, represented as not M (\u00acM).\n\nFrom these statements, we need to determine whether Sue was at the wedding or not (S or \u00acS).\n\nThe conditional statement \"If M, then S\" does not specify what happens when M is false (when Mary is not at the wedding). It only specifies that if Mary is at the wedding, then Sue must be there. However, if Mary is not at the wedding, Sue could either be at the wedding or not; the condition does not restrict Sue's attendance in the scenario where Mary is absent.\n\nTherefore, from the information given (Mary was not at the wedding), we cannot definitively conclude whether Sue was at the wedding or not. Sue's attendance is not logically determined by Mary's non-attendance.\n\nAnswer: no",
