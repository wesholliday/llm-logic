            "content": "The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is a conditional statement. It can be represented as: If P, then Q (where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis\").\n\nThe second statement given is \"Jeff did not play basketball.\" This is the negation of P, represented as not P.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer not Q (\"Amy did not play tennis\") from not P, we need to understand the logical relationship. The original statement does not specify what happens if Jeff does not play basketball; it only specifies a scenario when Jeff does play. Therefore, from not P alone, we cannot logically conclude not Q. Amy could still have played tennis regardless of whether Jeff played basketball or not.\n\nThus, based on the information given, we cannot infer that Amy did not play tennis just because Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
