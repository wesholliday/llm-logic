The book was not written by James.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If P (the book was written by James), then Q (the book is a mystery novel). \n\nThe second statement tells us that P is false (the book was not written by James).\n\nFrom these statements, we need to determine whether we can infer that Q is also false (the book is not a mystery novel).\n\nThe logical structure here is important. The first statement, being a conditional, only tells us the outcome (Q) if the condition (P) is met. However, it does not tell us anything about the outcome when the condition is not met. In other words, if P is false, Q could either be true or false. The falsity of P does not necessarily imply the falsity of Q.\n\nTherefore, from the information given (P is false), we cannot conclude that Q is also false. The book could still be a mystery novel even if it was not written by James, as there could be other authors who also write mystery novels.\n\nAnswer: no",
