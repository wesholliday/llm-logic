            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications given in the statements:\n\n1. \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n2. \"The apple was not red.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be written in logical form as:\n\\[ \\text{If } A \\text{ (apple is red), then } B \\text{ (banana is yellow)}. \\]\n\nThe second statement tells us that the condition \\( A \\) (apple is red) is false.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( \\text{If } A \\text{ then } B \\) is only false if \\( A \\) is true and \\( B \\) is false. Since \\( A \\) (apple is red) is false, the truth value of \\( B \\) (banana is yellow) does not affect the truth of the conditional statement. The conditional statement is true regardless of whether \\( B \\) is true or false when \\( A \\) is false.\n\nTherefore, from the information given, we cannot conclude that the banana was not yellow. The banana could be yellow or not yellow, and it would not contradict any of the statements provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
