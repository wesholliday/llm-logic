            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The wibble must be zizz\" asserts that it is necessary for the wibble to be zizz. This is a definitive statement about the state of the wibble. When considering the statement \"The wibble must be wobble or zizz,\" this suggests that the wibble must be either wobble or zizz, or possibly both. This is a broader condition than the first statement, as it allows for an additional possibility (wobble) alongside the necessity of being zizz.\n\nSince the original statement categorically states that the wibble must be zizz, it inherently fits within the broader condition where the wibble could be either wobble or zizz. If the wibble is zizz, as stated, then the condition of being either wobble or zizz is satisfied because zizz is one of the options provided. Therefore, the statement \"The wibble must be zizz\" logically implies that \"The wibble must be wobble or zizz,\" because the latter statement is a superset of the former.\n\nAnswer: yes",
