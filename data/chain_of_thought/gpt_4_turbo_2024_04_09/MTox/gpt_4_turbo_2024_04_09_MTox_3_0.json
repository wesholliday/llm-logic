The second statement is a conditional statement, which can be written in logical form as: If P (the splat was morphed), then Q (the splat quanked).\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Q is false (the splat did not quank). According to the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens (which states that if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must also be false), we can conclude that P is also false if P implies Q.\n\nSince \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" (If P then Q) and we know Q is false (\"The splat did not quank\"), then P must also be false. Therefore, \"The splat was not morphed\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
