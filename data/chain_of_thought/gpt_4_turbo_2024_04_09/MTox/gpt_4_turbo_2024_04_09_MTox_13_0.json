The structure of this statement is \"If P, then Q.\" Here, P is \"the glip was slogged\" and Q is \"the glip was tragged.\"\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" also implies its contrapositive \"If not Q, then not P.\" Applying this to the given statements:\n- P: The glip was slogged\n- Q: The glip was tragged\n- Contrapositive: If not Q (the glip was not tragged), then not P (the glip was not slogged).\n\nGiven statement 1 is \"The glip was not tragged\" (not Q), the contrapositive tells us that \"The glip was not slogged\" (not P) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the statements provided, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes",
