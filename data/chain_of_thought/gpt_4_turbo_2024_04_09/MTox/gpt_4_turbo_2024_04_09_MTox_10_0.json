The second statement is a conditional statement, which can be written in logical form as:\n   If S (the wug was sproinged), then G (the wug was garpled).\n\nFrom the first statement, we know:\n   Not G (the wug was not garpled).\n\nUsing the rule of contraposition in logic, the conditional statement \"If S then G\" can be rewritten as:\n   If not G, then not S.\n\nSince we know Not G is true (the wug was not garpled), we can conclude:\n   Not S (the wug was not sproinged).\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can infer that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
