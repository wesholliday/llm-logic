The second statement is a conditional statement, which can be written in logical form as: If P (the shank was plooked), then Q (the shank was nugged).\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Q is false (the shank was not nugged). According to the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens (which states that if \"If P then Q\" is true and Q is false, then P must also be false), we can conclude that P is also false if the conditional statement is true.\n\nSince the conditional statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\" is given as true, and we know Q (the shank was nugged) is false, then P (the shank was pooked) must also be false.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that the shank was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
