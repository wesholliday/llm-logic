According to the rules of logic, specifically the contrapositive in conditional reasoning, if \"If P then Q\" is true, then \"If not Q then not P\" must also be true. This means that if the smip did not lup the zoint (not Q), then the smip was not shripped (not P).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical analysis of these statements, we can infer that the smip was not shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
