According to the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens (which states that if \"if P then Q\" is true and Q is false, then P must also be false), we can conclude that P is also false. \n\nThus, since Q (the dreb was spened) is false, and the conditional statement (If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened) must hold true, then P (the dreb was vroombed) must also be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
