It can be broken down as:\n- If P (the sneg was crampled), then Q (the sneg sproted the frink).\n\nGiven that Q (the sneg sproted the frink) is false (from statement 1), we can use the rule of contraposition in logic, which states that \"if P then Q\" is logically equivalent to \"if not Q then not P.\" \n\nApplying this rule here:\n- Since Q is false (\"the sneg did not sproted the frink\"), then not P must be true. \n- Not P is \"the sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the logical analysis of the statements, we can infer that \"The sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
