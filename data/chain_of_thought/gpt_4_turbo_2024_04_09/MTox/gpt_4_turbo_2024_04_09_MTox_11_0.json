In logic, if \"If P then Q\" is true and Q is false, then P must also be false to maintain the truth of the implication. This is because the only scenario in which the implication fails is if P is true and Q is false.\n\nTherefore, since Q (\"the flug was zimmed\") is false, P (\"the flug was blummed\") must also be false to keep the implication true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
