According to the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens (which states that if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must also be false), we can conclude that P is also false.\n\nTherefore, since Q is false (the grommet did not plop the frink), and the conditional statement tells us that if P were true, Q would necessarily be true, it must be the case that P is false (the grommet was not sploffed).\n\nAnswer: yes",
