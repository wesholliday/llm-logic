According to the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens (which states that if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must also be false), we can conclude that P is also false if Q is false.\n\nSince Q (the wug bimmed the zoint) is false, and the conditional statement tells us that P (the wug was flooped) would lead to Q, we can conclude that P must be false to maintain logical consistency.\n\nTherefore, the wug was not flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
