In logic, if \"If P then Q\" is true and Q is false, then P must also be false to maintain the truth of the implication. This is because the only scenario in which the implication \"If P then Q\" holds true while Q is false is when P is also false (this avoids the logical fallacy of affirming the consequent).\n\nTherefore, since Q (\"the flugel was zargled\") is false, P (\"the flugel was blimmed\") must also be false to keep the implication true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
