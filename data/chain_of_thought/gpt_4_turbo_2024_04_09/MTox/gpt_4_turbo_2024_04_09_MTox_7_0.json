The second statement is a conditional: \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\"\n\nWe need to determine if these statements allow us to infer that \"The whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\nUsing the structure of the conditional statement (If P then Q), where P is \"the whiffle was shanked\" and Q is \"the whiffle tinked,\" we can apply the logical rule known as modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P then Q) and the negation of Q (not Q), then we can conclude the negation of P (not P).\n\nApplying this to the given statements:\n- P is \"the whiffle was shanked\"\n- Q is \"the whiffle tinked\"\n- The first statement tells us not Q (\"The whiffle did not tink\")\n- Therefore, by modus tollens, we can conclude not P (\"The whiffle was not shanked\").\n\nAnswer: yes",
