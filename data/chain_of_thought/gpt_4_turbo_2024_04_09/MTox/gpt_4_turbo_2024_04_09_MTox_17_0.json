The second statement is a conditional statement, which can be written in logical form as: If P (the flob was skizzled), then Q (the flob movated).\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Q is false (the flob did not movate). According to the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens, if \"If P then Q\" is true and Q is false, then P must also be false. Therefore, if the flob did not movate (Q is false), and if the flob was skizzled then it would have movated (If P then Q), it follows that the flob was not skizzled (P is false).\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can infer that the flob was not skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
