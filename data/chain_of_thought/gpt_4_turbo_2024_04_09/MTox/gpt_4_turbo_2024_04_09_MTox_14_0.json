According to the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens (the method of denying the consequent), if a conditional statement (If P then Q) is true and Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\nTherefore, since \"the clug snugged\" (Q) is false and the conditional statement \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\" is assumed true, it follows that \"the clug was fleeked\" (P) must be false.\n\nThus, we can infer that \"The clug was not fleeked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
