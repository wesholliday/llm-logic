            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is \"The sprocket was not daggled.\"\n2. The second statement is a conditional: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\"\n\nWe can represent the second statement using logical notation:\n- Let \\( C \\) represent \"The sprocket was cranked.\"\n- Let \\( D \\) represent \"The sprocket was daggled.\"\n- The conditional statement can then be written as \\( C \\rightarrow D \\) (If \\( C \\), then \\( D \\)).\n\nGiven that \\( D \\) is false (from the first statement, \"The sprocket was not daggled\"), we need to determine the truth value of \\( C \\).\n\nFrom the implication \\( C \\rightarrow D \\), we know that if \\( C \\) is true, then \\( D \\) must also be true. However, since \\( D \\) is false, \\( C \\) must also be false to maintain the truth of the implication. This is because the only scenario in which an implication \\( C \\rightarrow D \\) is false is when \\( C \\) is true and \\( D \\) is false. Since \\( D \\) is false and the implication must remain true, \\( C \\) must be false.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
