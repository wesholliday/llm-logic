In logical notation, this is S \u2192 C.\n\nStatement 1 tells us that the fribble did not crink, which we can write as \u00acC (not C).\n\nUsing the principle of modus tollens in logic, which states that if we have a conditional statement (S \u2192 C) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acC), we can infer the negation of the antecedent (\u00acS). In this case, since we know \u00acC (the fribble did not crink) and S \u2192 C (if the fribble was snurgled, then it crinked), we can conclude \u00acS (the fribble was not snurgled).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical analysis:\n\nAnswer: yes",
