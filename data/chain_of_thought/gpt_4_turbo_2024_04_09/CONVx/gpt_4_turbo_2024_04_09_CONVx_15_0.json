The truth of the first statement does not imply the truth of the second unless it is specifically stated that P is the only condition for Q or that P and Q always occur together (which is not stated here).\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was vroombed\" without additional information indicating such a relationship.\n\nAnswer: no",
