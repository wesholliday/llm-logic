The truth of the original conditional statement does not mean that the converse is also true unless additional information confirms that \\( P \\) is the only condition for \\( Q \\).\n\nTherefore, without additional information that \\( P \\) (the flob was skizzled) is the only possible cause of \\( Q \\) (the flob movated), we cannot infer that \\( Q \\implies P \\) just because \\( P \\implies Q \\) is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
