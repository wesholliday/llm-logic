The truth of the original conditional statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse unless additional information is provided that specifically establishes such a relationship.\n\nTherefore, without additional information linking \\( Q \\) back to \\( P \\), we cannot infer that the converse is true based solely on the truth of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
