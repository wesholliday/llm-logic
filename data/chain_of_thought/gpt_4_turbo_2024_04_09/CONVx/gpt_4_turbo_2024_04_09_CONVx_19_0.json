The original statement only indicates that whenever A happens, B must happen. However, it does not state that B happening must be caused by A; B could happen due to other reasons as well.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was vreebled.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
