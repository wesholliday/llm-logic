The original statement only tells us that being sproinged is a sufficient condition for being garpled, but it does not tell us that being garpled is a sufficient condition for being sproinged. Being garpled could potentially happen due to other reasons not specified in the original statement.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If the wug was garpled, then it was sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
