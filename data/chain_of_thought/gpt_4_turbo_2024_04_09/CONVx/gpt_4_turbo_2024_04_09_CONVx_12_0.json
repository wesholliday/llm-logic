The truth of the original statement (if \\( P \\) then \\( Q \\)) does not mean that whenever \\( Q \\) happens, \\( P \\) must necessarily have happened. The converse needs separate verification or proof and is not inherently true just because the original statement is true.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint,\" we cannot infer that \"If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was shripped\" without additional information.\n\nAnswer: no",
