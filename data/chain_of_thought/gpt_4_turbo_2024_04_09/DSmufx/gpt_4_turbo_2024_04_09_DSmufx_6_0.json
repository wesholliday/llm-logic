According to this rule, if we have P or S (either P is true, or S is true, or both are true), and we know that not P is true (P is false), then S must be true.\n\nTherefore, given the truth of \"Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed\" and \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped,\" we can logically infer that \"The grommet is sploffed\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
