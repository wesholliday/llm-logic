It states that one of the following must be true:\n- The smonk must be plagged.\n- The smonk is vreebled.\n\nThe second statement negates the first part of the disjunction:\n- It is not true that the smonk must be plagged.\n\nGiven that in a disjunction (A or B), if A is false, then B must be true to satisfy the disjunction, we can analyze the given statements:\n- Since it is not true that the smonk must be plagged, the only remaining possibility for the disjunction to hold true is that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
