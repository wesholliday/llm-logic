According to this rule, if we have T \u2228 S (either T or S is true) and we know \u00acT (T is not true), then S must be true.\n\nThus, from T \u2228 S and \u00acT, we can infer S.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether we can infer \"The whiffle is shanked\" from the given statements is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
