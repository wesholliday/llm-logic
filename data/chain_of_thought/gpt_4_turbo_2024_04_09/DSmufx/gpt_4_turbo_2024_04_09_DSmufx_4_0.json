It asserts that at least one of the following conditions must be true:\n- The fribble must be crinked.\n- The fribble is snurgled.\n\nThe second statement is a negation. It asserts that:\n- The fribble must not be crinked.\n\nGiven that the first statement tells us that either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled, and the second statement negates the first option (the fribble must be crinked), we are left with only the second option from the first statement as being true.\n\nTherefore, since it is not the case that the fribble must be crinked, the only remaining possibility from the disjunction is that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
