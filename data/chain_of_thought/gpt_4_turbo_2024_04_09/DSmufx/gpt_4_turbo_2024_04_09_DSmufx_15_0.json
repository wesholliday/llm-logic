It asserts that at least one of the following conditions must be true:\n- The dreb must be spened.\n- The dreb is vroombed.\n\nThe second statement is a negation. It denies that:\n- The dreb must be spened.\n\nGiven that the first statement tells us that at least one of the two conditions must be true, and the second statement tells us that the first condition (\"The dreb must be spened\") is false, we are left with only the second condition of the disjunction being true.\n\nTherefore, since \"The dreb must be spened\" is false, the only remaining possibility under the disjunction is that \"The dreb is vroombed\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
