It can be symbolically represented as:\n\\[ P \\lor Q \\]\nwhere \\( P \\) represents \"the splat must be quanked\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"the splat is morphed.\"\n\nThe second statement negates the first part of the disjunction:\n\\[ \\neg P \\]\nwhich means \"It is not the case that the splat must be quanked.\"\n\nIn logic, the truth of a disjunction \\( P \\lor Q \\) is such that if either \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\) is true, then \\( P \\lor Q \\) is true. If \\( P \\) is false (\\( \\neg P \\)), then for \\( P \\lor Q \\) to still be true, \\( Q \\) must necessarily be true.\n\nGiven that \\( \\neg P \\) (the splat must not be quanked) is true, and since \\( P \\lor Q \\) (either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed) must also be true, the only possibility left for the disjunction to hold is if \\( Q \\) (the splat is morphed) is true.\n\nTherefore, from the statements provided, we can infer that \"The splat is morphed\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
