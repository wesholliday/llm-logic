It asserts that at least one of the following must be true:\n- The clug must be snugged.\n- The clug is fleeked.\n\nThe second statement is a negation. It asserts that:\n- It is not true that the clug must be snugged.\n\nGiven that the second statement negates the first possibility of the disjunction in the first statement, the structure of the argument forces us to accept the remaining possibility in order to satisfy the truth of the disjunction. Therefore, since it is not true that the clug must be snugged, the only remaining possibility that can be true, according to the first statement, is that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
