            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications given in the statements:\n\n1. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\n   - This statement can be represented as: If L (Lisa bought the red shirt), then M (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n\n2. \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\"\n   - This statement suggests that it is possible that M is false (Mark did not buy the blue shirt).\n\nGiven these statements, we need to determine if we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt (L is false).\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that L implies M. This means that if L is true, then M must also be true. However, statement 2 tells us that it is possible for M to be false.\n\nIf M is false, then L must also be false because the truth of L depends on the truth of M (since L implies M). Therefore, if Mark might not have bought the blue shirt (M might be false), then it is possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt (L might be false).\n\nThus, given the possibility that M is false, we can infer that it is possible that L is also false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
