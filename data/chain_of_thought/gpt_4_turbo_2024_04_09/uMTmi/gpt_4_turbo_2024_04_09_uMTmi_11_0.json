If the first part (the cake was chocolate) is true, then the second part (the muffins were blueberry) must also be true.\n\n2. \"Also, the muffins might not have been blueberry.\"\n   This statement introduces a possibility that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer the following:\n- If the cake was indeed chocolate, then the muffins had to be blueberry (from statement 1).\n- However, there is a possibility that the muffins were not blueberry (from statement 2).\n\nIf it turns out that the muffins were not blueberry, then, according to the first statement, the cake could not have been chocolate. This is because the condition for the cake being chocolate (that the muffins must be blueberry) was not met.\n\nTherefore, given the possibility that the muffins might not have been blueberry, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
