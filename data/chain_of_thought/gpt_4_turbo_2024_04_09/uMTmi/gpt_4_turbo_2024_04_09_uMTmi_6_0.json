            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications given in the statements:\n\n1. \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\" This can be represented as: If P (Sue chose pizza), then Q (Bob chose pasta).\n\n2. \"Bob might not have chosen pasta.\" This indicates that it is possible that Q is false.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that P implies Q. Therefore, if P is true (Sue chose pizza), then Q must also be true (Bob must have chosen pasta).\n\nHowever, the second statement tells us that it is possible for Q to be false (Bob might not have chosen pasta).\n\nIf Q (Bob chose pasta) is possibly false, and since P implies Q, then P (Sue chose pizza) must also be false to maintain logical consistency. If Sue had chosen pizza, then Bob choosing pasta would be a certainty, contradicting the possibility of Bob not choosing pasta.\n\nThus, given that Bob might not have chosen pasta, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
