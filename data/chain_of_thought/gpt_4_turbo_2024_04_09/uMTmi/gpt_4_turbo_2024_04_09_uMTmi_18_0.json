            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications given in the statements:\n\n1. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. If the first part (the doll was plastic) is true, then the second part (the truck must have been metal) must also be true.\n\n2. \"Also, the truck might not have been metal.\"\n   - This statement introduces the possibility that the truck was not metal.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n- If the doll was indeed plastic, according to the first statement, the truck must have been metal. However, the second statement introduces the possibility that the truck might not have been metal.\n\nGiven these two statements, if we assume the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal (from the first statement). But the second statement contradicts this by saying the truck might not have been metal. This contradiction implies that our initial assumption (the doll was plastic) leads to a contradiction under the given statements.\n\nTherefore, since assuming the doll was plastic leads to a contradiction with the given information about the truck, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
