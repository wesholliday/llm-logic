            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the statements given:\n\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This can be represented as: If M (Mary was at the wedding), then S (Sue was at the wedding).\n\n2. \"Sue might not have been at the wedding.\" This indicates that it is possible that S is false.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Mary being at the wedding (M) implies that Sue must also be at the wedding (S). Therefore, if M is true, then S must also be true.\n\nGiven the second statement, we know that it is possible for S to be false. If S were false, then according to the implication in the first statement (If M, then S), M must also be false. This is because the truth of M would require the truth of S, and if S is false, M cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, given that it is possible for S to be false, and if S is false then M must be false, we can infer that it is possible that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
