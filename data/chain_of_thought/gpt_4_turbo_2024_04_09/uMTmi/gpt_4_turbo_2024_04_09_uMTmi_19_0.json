            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications given in the statements:\n\n1. \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\" This can be represented as: If T (Tom watched football), then J (Jen watched basketball).\n\n2. \"Jen might not have watched basketball.\" This indicates that it is possible that J is false.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that T implies J. This is a conditional statement where the truth of T (Tom watching football) guarantees the truth of J (Jen watching basketball).\n\nGiven the second statement, we know that there is a possibility that J is false (Jen did not watch basketball).\n\nIf J is false, then T must also be false because the truth of T depends on the truth of J (from the conditional statement \"If T, then J\"). If J were false and T were true, it would contradict the given conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, if it is possible that Jen did not watch basketball (J is false), then it must be that Tom did not watch football (T is false) to maintain the truth of the conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
