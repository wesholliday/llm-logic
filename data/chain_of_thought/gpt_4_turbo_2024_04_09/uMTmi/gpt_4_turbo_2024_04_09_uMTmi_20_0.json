            "content": "To solve this, let's analyze the statements given:\n\n1. \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This is a conditional statement where the redness of the apple guarantees the yellowness of the banana. In logical terms, this can be represented as: If A (apple is red), then B (banana is yellow).\n\n2. \"The banana might not have been yellow.\" This statement introduces the possibility that B is not true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if these statements allow us to infer that the apple was not red.\n\nFrom the first statement, if A is true (apple is red), then B must be true (banana is yellow). However, the second statement introduces the possibility that B might not be true (banana might not be yellow).\n\nIf B might not be true, and knowing that A being true requires B to be true, we can infer that A might not be true either, because the condition for A being true (B being true) is not necessarily met.\n\nTherefore, given the possibility that B (banana is yellow) might not be true, it is possible to infer that A (apple is red) might not be true either.\n\nAnswer: yes",
