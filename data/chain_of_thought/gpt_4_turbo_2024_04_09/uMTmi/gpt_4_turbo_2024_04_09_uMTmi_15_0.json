However, the second statement introduces the possibility that Q is false (Erin might not have taken a train).\n\nIf Q (Erin took a train) is possibly false, and knowing that P (Sam took a plane) implies Q (Erin took a train) must be true, then P must be false to maintain logical consistency. If P were true, Q would have to be true, which contradicts the possibility of Q being false.\n\nTherefore, if there is a possibility that Erin did not take a train, it implies that Sam did not take a plane to avoid a contradiction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
