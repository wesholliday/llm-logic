This means Alex did not finish the race, because if Alex had finished, Chris would necessarily have finished, which contradicts the possibility that Chris might not have finished.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether we can infer that Alex did not finish the race, based on the given statements, is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
