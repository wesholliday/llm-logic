It states that one of the following must be true:\n- The fribble is snurgled.\n- The fribble must be crinked.\n\nThe second statement introduces a possibility: \"The fribble might not be crinked.\" This suggests that there is a possibility that the fribble is not crinked, but it does not confirm that the fribble is definitely not crinked.\n\nTo infer \"The fribble is snurgled\" from these statements, we would need to establish that the fribble being not crinked is a certainty, because only then the alternative in the disjunction (the fribble is snurgled) must necessarily be true to satisfy the first statement.\n\nHowever, the second statement only suggests the possibility that the fribble might not be crinked, not that it definitely isn't crinked. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that \"The fribble is snurgled\" based solely on the possibility that it might not be crinked.\n\nAnswer: no",
