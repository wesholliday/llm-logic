It tells us that at least one of the following conditions must be true:\n- The splat is morphed.\n- The splat must be quanked.\n\nThe second statement introduces a possibility: \"The splat might not be quanked.\" This means there is a possibility that the splat is not quanked, but it does not confirm that the splat is definitely not quanked.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The splat is morphed\" from these statements, consider the implications:\n- If the splat is not quanked (considering the possibility raised by the second statement), then according to the first statement (\"either/or\"), the splat must be morphed to satisfy the condition.\n- However, the second statement does not definitively assert that the splat is not quanked; it only suggests it as a possibility.\n\nSince the second statement does not confirm that the splat is not quanked, but only suggests it might not be, we cannot definitively conclude that the splat must be morphed. There remains a possibility that the splat is quanked, which would satisfy the first statement without requiring the splat to be morphed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The splat is morphed\" based solely on these statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
