This statement suggests uncertainty about whether the flug was blummed or not.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed\" means it is not necessarily true that the flug was blummed. This statement denies the necessity of the flug being blummed.\n\nFrom the first statement, if there is a possibility that the flug was not blummed, it implies that there is no certainty or necessity that the flug was blummed. Therefore, it is not necessarily the case that the flug was blummed.\n\nThus, from the statement \"The flug might not have been blummed,\" we can infer that \"It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
