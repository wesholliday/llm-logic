This statement does not confirm whether the smonk was vreebled or not; it only opens up the possibility that the smonk might not have been vreebled.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled\" implies that it is not necessarily true or required that the smonk was vreebled. This statement denies the necessity of the smonk being vreebled.\n\nFrom the first statement, if there is a possibility that the smonk was not vreebled, then it cannot be necessarily true that the smonk was vreebled. Therefore, the possibility that the smonk might not have been vreebled logically supports the claim that it is not necessarily the case that the smonk must have been vreebled.\n\nThus, from the statement \"The smonk might not have been vreebled,\" we can infer that \"It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
