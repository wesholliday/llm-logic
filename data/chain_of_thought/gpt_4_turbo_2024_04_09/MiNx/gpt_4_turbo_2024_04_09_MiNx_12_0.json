This statement does not confirm whether the smip was shripped or not; it only opens up the possibility that it might not have been.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the smip must have been shripped\" implies that it is not necessarily true or required that the smip was shripped. This statement negates any certainty or requirement about the smip being shripped.\n\nFrom the first statement, since there is a possibility that the smip was not shripped, it implies uncertainty about the smip being shripped. This uncertainty aligns with the second statement, which negates the necessity or certainty of the smip being shripped.\n\nTherefore, the inference from \"The smip might not have been shripped\" to \"It's not the case that the smip must have been shripped\" is logically valid because acknowledging the possibility of the smip not being shripped negates the certainty or necessity of it having been shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
