This statement negates the necessity of the event occurring.\n\n2. \"The smip might not have been shripped\" suggests the possibility that the smip was not shripped. This statement introduces the possibility of the event not occurring.\n\nFrom the first statement, if it is not necessarily true that the smip was shripped, then it is possible that the smip was not shripped. The negation of necessity (must) in the first statement opens up the possibility (might) that the contrary could be true.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"It's not the case that the smip must have been shripped,\" we can infer that \"The smip might not have been shripped,\" because the absence of necessity allows for the possibility of the contrary.\n\nAnswer: yes",
