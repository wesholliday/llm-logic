            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The software must have been updated and restarted\" explicitly mentions two actions: updating and restarting the software. The use of \"and\" in the phrase connects these two actions, indicating that both occurred. Since the statement includes that the software was restarted as part of the sequence of events, it directly implies that the software must have been restarted. Therefore, from the given statement, we can infer that the software was indeed restarted.\n\nAnswer: yes",
