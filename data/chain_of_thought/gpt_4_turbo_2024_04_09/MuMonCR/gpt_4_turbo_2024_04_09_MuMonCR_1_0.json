            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The envelope must have been upstairs and under a bed\" explicitly mentions two conditions: 1) the envelope was upstairs, and 2) the envelope was under a bed. The inference \"The envelope must have been under a bed\" focuses solely on the second part of the original statement, ignoring the location specified as \"upstairs.\" Since the original statement confirms that the envelope was under a bed, regardless of it also being upstairs, the inference that it was under a bed is directly supported by the original statement. The additional detail of being \"upstairs\" does not negate the fact that it was under a bed. Therefore, the inference is logically valid based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: yes",
