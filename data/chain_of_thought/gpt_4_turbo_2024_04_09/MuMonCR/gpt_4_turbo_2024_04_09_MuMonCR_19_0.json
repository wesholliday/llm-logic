            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The application must have been completed online and included references\" clearly indicates that two conditions were required for the application: 1) it must have been completed online, and 2) it must have included references. The conjunction \"and\" used in the sentence connects these two conditions, making both equally necessary. Therefore, if the application was completed as stated, it necessarily included references. This direct statement about the application including references allows us to infer that the inclusion of references was a mandatory part of the application process.\n\nAnswer: yes",
