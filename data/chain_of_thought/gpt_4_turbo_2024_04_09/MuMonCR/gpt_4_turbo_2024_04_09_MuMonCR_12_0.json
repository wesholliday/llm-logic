            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday and under budget\" explicitly mentions two conditions that must be met: the project's completion by Friday and its adherence to a budget constraint. The use of \"and\" in the statement connects these two conditions, indicating that both are essential components of the statement. Therefore, if the statement is true, it necessarily implies that each individual condition is also true. Specifically, if the project must have been completed by Friday and under budget, then it follows directly that the project must have been under budget.\n\nAnswer: yes",
