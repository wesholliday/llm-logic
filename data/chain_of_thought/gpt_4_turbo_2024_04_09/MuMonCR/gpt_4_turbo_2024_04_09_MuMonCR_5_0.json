            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for\" explicitly includes the information that the package was signed for. This statement is a compound statement that asserts two things: 1) the package was delivered today, and 2) the package was signed for. The conjunction \"and\" in the statement connects these two assertions, making them both essential components of the claim. Therefore, if the entire statement is accepted as true, then each part of the statement must also be true. Thus, from the statement that the package must have been delivered today and signed for, it logically follows that the package must have been signed for.\n\nAnswer: yes",
