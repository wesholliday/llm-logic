            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM\" contains two pieces of information about the concert: it was sold out, and it started at 8 PM. The use of \"and\" in the sentence connects these two facts, indicating that both are true. When considering the inference \"The concert must have started at 8 PM,\" we are focusing solely on the second part of the original statement regarding the starting time of the concert. Since the original statement explicitly states that the concert started at 8 PM, and there is no conditional or uncertain language regarding the time, it is a direct and clear assertion. Therefore, the inference that the concert must have started at 8 PM is directly supported by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
