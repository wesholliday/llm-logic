            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The room must have been cleaned daily and had fresh towels\" explicitly mentions two conditions: the room being cleaned daily and the room having fresh towels. The use of \"and\" in the sentence connects these two conditions, indicating that both occurred. Therefore, if the entire statement is accepted as true, then each individual part of the statement (the room being cleaned daily and the room having fresh towels) must also be true. Thus, from the given statement, it can be inferred that the room must have had fresh towels.\n\nAnswer: yes",
