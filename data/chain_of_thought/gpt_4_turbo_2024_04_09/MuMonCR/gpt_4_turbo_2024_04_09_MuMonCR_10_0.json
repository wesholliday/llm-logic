            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been signed and notarized\" clearly indicates that two actions were required: signing and notarizing the document. The use of \"and\" in the phrase connects both actions as necessary conditions. Therefore, if the document must have been signed and notarized, it follows directly that the document must have been notarized as part of fulfilling these conditions. Thus, from the original statement, we can infer that notarization is a required action.\n\nAnswer: yes",
