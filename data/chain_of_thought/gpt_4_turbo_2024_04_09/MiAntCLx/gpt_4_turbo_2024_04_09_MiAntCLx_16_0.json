The addition of \"and snork zibber quank\" introduces new elements that were not included or implied in the original statement. Since the original statement does not provide any information about \"snork zibber quank,\" we cannot infer that this additional condition might also be true based solely on the original statement. The original statement's scope is limited to the possibility of the wumble being plonk flump, without any reference to snork zibber quank.\n\nAnswer: no",
