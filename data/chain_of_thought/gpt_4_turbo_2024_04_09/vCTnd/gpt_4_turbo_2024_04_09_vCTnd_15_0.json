            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise under all possible circumstances.\n\n1. **Premise**: If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly.\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"the room was tidied\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the room was tidied thoroughly\".\n\n2. **Conclusion**: If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied.\n   - This can be represented as: \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - The premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) states that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be false.\n   - The conclusion \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) states that if \\( Q \\) is true, then \\( P \\) must be false.\n\n4. **Logical Equivalence**:\n   - The premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is logically equivalent to \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) by the rule of contraposition. The contraposition of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), which is exactly the conclusion.\n\n5. **Validity**:\n   - Since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise and contraposition is a valid logical rule, the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise in all cases.\n\nThus, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion is guaranteed by the premise through a valid logical rule (contraposition).\n\nAnswer: yes",
