This is because the contrapositive of \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\), which in this case translates to \\( \\neg (\\neg H) \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) or \\( H \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the contrapositive of the premise is exactly the conclusion, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
