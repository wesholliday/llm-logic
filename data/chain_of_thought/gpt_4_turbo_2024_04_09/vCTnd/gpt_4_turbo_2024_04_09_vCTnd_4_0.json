            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement: \"If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently.\" Symbolically, this can be represented as \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), where \\( P \\) represents \"Ben studied\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) represents \"Ben did not study diligently.\"\n\nThe conclusion is another conditional statement: \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nTo check the validity of the argument, we need to see if the truth of the premise necessarily leads to the truth of the conclusion. This involves checking if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) logically implies \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nUsing the rules of logic, particularly the contrapositive, we know that a statement \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is logically equivalent to its contrapositive \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). Therefore, if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is true, then \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\nSince the premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) implies the conclusion \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) through the contrapositive, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
