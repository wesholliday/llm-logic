            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nPremise: If Ann exercised, then she did not exercise strenuously.\nThis can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) where \\( P \\) represents \"Ann exercised\" and \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"Ann did not exercise strenuously.\"\n\nConclusion: If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise.\nThis can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) where \\( S \\) represents \"Ann exercised strenuously.\"\n\nTo test the validity of the argument, we need to see if the truth of the premise necessarily leads to the truth of the conclusion. This involves checking if a situation where the premise is true but the conclusion is false can exist.\n\n1. Assume the premise is true: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\). This means if Ann exercised, then it is true that she did not exercise strenuously.\n\n2. From the premise, we know that if \\( P \\) (Ann exercised) is true, then \\( S \\) (Ann exercised strenuously) must be false. This is because \\( \\neg S \\) (Ann did not exercise strenuously) is the outcome of \\( P \\).\n\n3. Now, consider the conclusion \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). This states that if Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise at all. Given the premise, if \\( S \\) were true, \\( P \\) would have to be false because \\( P \\) leads to \\( \\neg S \\), and \\( S \\) contradicts \\( \\neg S \\).\n\n4. Therefore, if \\( S \\) is true, \\( P \\) must indeed be false, which aligns with the conclusion \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nSince the premise logically leads to the conclusion (i.e., there is no situation where the premise is true and the conclusion is false), the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
