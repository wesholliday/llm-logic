            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise given is: \"If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg V \\), where \\( P \\) represents \"I went to the store\" and \\( V \\) represents \"I bought vegetables.\"\n\nThe conclusion stated is: \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( V \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nThe question is whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In logical terms, this involves checking if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg V \\) implies \\( V \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nUsing the rules of logic, specifically the contrapositive, we know that \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg V \\) is logically equivalent to \\( V \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). The contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\), and it always holds the same truth value as the original statement.\n\nThus, since \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg V \\) is equivalent to \\( V \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), the conclusion \\( V \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) does indeed logically follow from the premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg V \\).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
