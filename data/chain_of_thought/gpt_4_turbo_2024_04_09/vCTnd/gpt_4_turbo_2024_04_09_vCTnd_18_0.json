            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise**: If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth.\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg D \\) where \\( P \\) represents \"the issue was discussed\" and \\( D \\) represents \"the issue was discussed in depth\".\n\n2. **Conclusion**: If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed.\n   - This can be represented as: \\( D \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - The premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg D \\) states that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( D \\) must be false.\n   - The conclusion \\( D \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) states that if \\( D \\) is true, then \\( P \\) must be false.\n\n4. **Logical Equivalence**:\n   - The premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg D \\) is logically equivalent to \\( D \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) by the rule of contraposition. The contraposition of an implication states that \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is logically equivalent to \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\).\n\n5. **Validity**:\n   - Since the premise and the conclusion are logically equivalent, the argument is valid. If the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true based on the same logical structure.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
