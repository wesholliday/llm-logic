            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement: \"If Jane studied, then she did not study long.\" Symbolically, this can be represented as \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), where \\( P \\) represents \"Jane studied\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) represents \"Jane did not study long.\"\n\nThe conclusion presented is another conditional statement: \"If Jane studied long, then she did not study.\" Symbolically, this can be represented as \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nTo test the validity of the argument, we need to see if the truth of the premise necessarily leads to the truth of the conclusion. This involves checking if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) logically implies \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\n1. Assume \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is true. This means whenever \\( P \\) is true, \\( \\neg Q \\) must also be true.\n\n2. Consider what happens if \\( Q \\) (Jane studied long) is true. According to the premise, if \\( P \\) (Jane studied) is true, then \\( \\neg Q \\) (Jane did not study long) must be true. Therefore, if \\( Q \\) is true, \\( P \\) must be false because \\( P \\) being true leads to \\( \\neg Q \\), which contradicts \\( Q \\) being true.\n\n3. Thus, if \\( Q \\) is true, \\( P \\) must be false, which is exactly what \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) states.\n\nSince assuming the truth of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) leads to the truth of \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
