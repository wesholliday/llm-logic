            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise under all possible circumstances.\n\n1. **Premise**: If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much.\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   - Here, \\( P \\) represents \"Alex exercised\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) represents \"Alex did not exercise much\".\n\n2. **Conclusion**: If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise.\n   - This can be represented as: \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   - Here, \\( Q \\) represents \"Alex exercised much\" and \\( \\neg P \\) represents \"Alex did not exercise\".\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - The premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) states that if \\( P \\) is true (Alex exercised), then \\( Q \\) must be false (Alex did not exercise much).\n   - The conclusion \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) states that if \\( Q \\) is true (Alex exercised much), then \\( P \\) must be false (Alex did not exercise).\n\n4. **Logical Validity**:\n   - To check if the argument is valid, we need to see if there's any situation where the premise is true but the conclusion is false.\n   - Consider a situation where Alex did not exercise at all. In this case:\n     - \\( P \\) is false (Alex did not exercise).\n     - \\( \\neg Q \\) is true (Alex did not exercise much, because he didn't exercise at all).\n     - The premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is true because a false statement implies anything.\n   - Now, check the conclusion:\n     - Since Alex did not exercise much (\\( Q \\) is false), the conclusion \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is also true because a false statement implies anything.\n\n5. **Contradictory Scenario**:\n   - Consider a scenario where Alex exercised but not much. Here:\n     - \\( P \\) is true.\n     - \\( Q \\) is false.\n     - The premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is true.\n   - Now, check the conclusion:\n     - Since \\( Q \\) is false, \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is true (again, because a false statement implies anything).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - In every scenario considered, the premise being true never leads to the conclusion being false.\n   - Therefore, the argument is logically valid because there is no scenario where the premise is true and the conclusion is false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
