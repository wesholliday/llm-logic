This involves checking if the contrapositive of the premise is equivalent to the conclusion.\n\nThe contrapositive of the premise P \u2192 \u00acE is:\nE \u2192 \u00acP\n\nThis is exactly the conclusion. Since the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the statement itself, the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
