            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise given is: \"If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal.\" In logical form, this can be written as:\nP \u2192 \u00acQ\nwhere P represents \"I ate a meal\" and Q represents \"I ate a large meal.\"\n\nThe conclusion given is: \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal.\" This can be written as:\nQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nTo check if the argument is valid, we need to see if the truth of the premise necessarily leads to the truth of the conclusion. This involves checking if the logical form of the argument is valid.\n\nThe form of the argument is:\nP \u2192 \u00acQ\nTherefore, Q \u2192 \u00acP\n\nThis is a form of contraposition in logic, where the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of P \u2192 \u00acQ is Q \u2192 \u00acP. Since a statement is always logically equivalent to its contrapositive, the argument form here is valid.\n\nThus, if the premise \"If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal\" is true, then the conclusion \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal\" must also be true, based on the rules of logic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
