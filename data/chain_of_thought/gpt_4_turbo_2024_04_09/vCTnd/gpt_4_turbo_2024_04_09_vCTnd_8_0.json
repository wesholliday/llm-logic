The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the statement itself. Therefore, if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is true, then \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the contrapositive of the premise is the same as the conclusion, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
