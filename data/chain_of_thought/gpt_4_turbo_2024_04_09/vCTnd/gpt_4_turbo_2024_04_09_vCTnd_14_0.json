            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise**: If the meal was prepared, then it was not prepared carefully.\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) where \\( P \\) represents \"the meal was prepared\" and \\( C \\) represents \"the meal was prepared carefully\".\n\n2. **Conclusion**: If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared.\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - The premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) states that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( C \\) must be false.\n   - The conclusion \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) states that if \\( C \\) is true, then \\( P \\) must be false.\n\n4. **Logical Equivalence**:\n   - The premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) is logically equivalent to \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) by the rule of contraposition in classical logic. The contraposition of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) is \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), which is exactly the conclusion.\n\n5. **Validity**:\n   - Since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise and contraposition is a valid logical rule, the argument is valid. The conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
