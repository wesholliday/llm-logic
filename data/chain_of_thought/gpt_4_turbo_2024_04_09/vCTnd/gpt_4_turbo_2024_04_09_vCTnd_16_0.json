            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise**: If the job was completed, then it was not completed well.\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   - Here, \\( P \\) represents \"the job was completed\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) represents \"the job was not completed well\".\n\n2. **Conclusion**: If the job was completed well, then it was not completed.\n   - This can be represented as: \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   - Here, \\( Q \\) represents \"the job was completed well\" and \\( \\neg P \\) represents \"the job was not completed\".\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - The premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) implies that if \\( P \\) is true (the job was completed), then \\( Q \\) must be false (the job was not completed well).\n   - The conclusion \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) implies that if \\( Q \\) is true (the job was completed well), then \\( P \\) must be false (the job was not completed).\n\n4. **Logical Equivalence**:\n   - The premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) can be rewritten using the logical equivalence of implication as \\( \\neg P \\lor \\neg Q \\).\n   - The conclusion \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) can also be rewritten using the logical equivalence of implication as \\( \\neg Q \\lor \\neg P \\).\n\n5. **Validity**:\n   - The premise and the conclusion are contrapositives of each other. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nGiven this analysis, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise due to their contrapositive relationship.\n\nAnswer: yes",
