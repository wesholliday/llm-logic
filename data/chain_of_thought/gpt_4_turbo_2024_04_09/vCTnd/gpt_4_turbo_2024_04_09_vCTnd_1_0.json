            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise**: If it's raining, then it's not raining hard.\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) represents \"it's raining\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"it's raining hard\".\n\n2. **Conclusion**: If it's raining hard, then it's not raining.\n   - This can be represented as: \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - The premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) states that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be false.\n   - The conclusion \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) states that if \\( Q \\) is true, then \\( P \\) must be false.\n\n4. **Logical Equivalence**:\n   - The premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is logically equivalent to \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) by the rule of contraposition in classical logic. The contraposition of a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), which has the same truth value as the original statement.\n\n5. **Validity**:\n   - Since the premise logically implies the conclusion through contraposition, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
