            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise is: \"If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly.\" In logical form, this can be written as:\nP \u2192 \u00acQ\nwhere P represents \"instructions were given\" and Q represents \"instructions were explained clearly.\"\n\nThe conclusion is: \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given.\" This can be written as:\nQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nTo test the validity of the argument, we need to check if the truth of the premise necessarily leads to the truth of the conclusion. This involves checking if the contrapositive of the premise is equivalent to the conclusion.\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement of the form P \u2192 \u00acQ is \u00ac\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, which simplifies to Q \u2192 \u00acP. This is exactly the conclusion.\n\nSince the contrapositive of the premise is equivalent to the conclusion, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
