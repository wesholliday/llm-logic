            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise**: If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly.\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   - Here, \\( P \\) represents \"the customer was served\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) represents \"the customer was not served promptly\".\n\n2. **Conclusion**: If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served.\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   - Here, \\( Q \\) represents \"the customer was served promptly\" and \\( \\neg P \\) represents \"the customer was not served\".\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - The premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) states that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be false.\n   - The conclusion \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) states that if \\( Q \\) is true, then \\( P \\) must be false.\n   - To check the validity, we need to see if the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\n4. **Logical Equivalence**:\n   - The premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is logically equivalent to \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) by the rule of contraposition in logic. The contraposition of an implication states that \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is equivalent to \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the premise is logically equivalent to the conclusion through contraposition, the argument is valid. If the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
