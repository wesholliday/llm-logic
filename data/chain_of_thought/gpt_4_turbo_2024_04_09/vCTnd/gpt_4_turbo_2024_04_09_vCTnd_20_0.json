            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise**: If a recommendation was made, then it was not a strong recommendation.\n   - This can be symbolically represented as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) represents \"a recommendation was made\" and \\( S \\) represents \"it was a strong recommendation\".\n\n2. **Conclusion**: If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made.\n   - This can be symbolically represented as: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - The premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) states that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( S \\) must be false.\n   - The conclusion \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) states that if \\( S \\) is true, then \\( P \\) must be false.\n\n4. **Logical Equivalence**:\n   - We need to check if the premise logically implies the conclusion.\n   - The premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is equivalent to \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) by the rule of contraposition. The contraposition of an implication states that \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is logically equivalent to \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\).\n   - Applying this to our premise: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is equivalent to \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is equivalent to the conclusion \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) through contraposition, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
