            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nPremise: If the customer was greeted, then they were not greeted warmly.\nThis can be symbolically represented as: G \u2192 \u00acW\n(where G = the customer was greeted, W = the customer was greeted warmly, and \u00acW = the customer was not greeted warmly)\n\nConclusion: If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted.\nThis can be symbolically represented as: W \u2192 \u00acG\n\nTo test the validity of the argument, we need to check if the truth of the premise necessarily leads to the truth of the conclusion. This involves checking if the contrapositive of the premise matches the conclusion.\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P\". Applying this to the premise:\nOriginal premise: G \u2192 \u00acW\nContrapositive: W \u2192 \u00acG\n\nThe contrapositive of the premise (W \u2192 \u00acG) is exactly the conclusion. Since the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the statement itself, the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
