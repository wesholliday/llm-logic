            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nPremise: If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly.\nSymbolically, this can be represented as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) where \\( P \\) represents \"the clothes were washed\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"the clothes were washed properly\".\n\nConclusion: If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed.\nSymbolically, this can be represented as: \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nTo check the validity of the argument, we need to see if the truth of the premise necessarily leads to the truth of the conclusion. This involves checking if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) logically implies \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nUsing the rules of logic, particularly the contrapositive, we know that \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is logically equivalent to \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). The contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\), and it always holds the same truth value as the original statement.\n\nThus, since \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is equivalent to \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), the premise logically implies the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
