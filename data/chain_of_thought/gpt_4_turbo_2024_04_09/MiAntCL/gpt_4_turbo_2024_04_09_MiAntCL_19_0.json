            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The application might be completed online\" suggests the possibility of completing the application through the internet. However, this statement does not provide any information about the specific requirements or contents of the application, such as whether it includes references. To infer that the application \"might be completed online and include references\" would require additional information indicating that references are a part of the application process. Since the original statement does not mention anything about including references, it is not possible to logically infer that the application both might be completed online and include references based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
