            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package might be delivered today\" suggests the possibility of the package being delivered on the specified day, but it does not include any information about the package being signed for upon delivery. The addition of \"and signed for\" introduces a new condition that is not addressed in the original statement. Since the original statement does not provide any information about the signing process, we cannot infer that the package being delivered also implies it will be signed for. The two events\u2014delivery and signing\u2014are related but not necessarily linked as a certainty in the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
