            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document might be signed\" suggests the possibility that the document has been signed, but it does not provide any information about whether the document has also been notarized. The addition of \"and notarized\" introduces a new element that was not addressed in the original statement. Since the original statement does not imply anything about the document being notarized, we cannot infer that both conditions (signed and notarized) might be true based solely on the information that the document might be signed. Therefore, the inference that \"The document might be signed and notarized\" goes beyond what is logically supported by the statement \"The document might be signed.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
