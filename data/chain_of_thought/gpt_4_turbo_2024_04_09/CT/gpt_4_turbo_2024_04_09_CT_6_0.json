In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta,\" we can indeed infer that \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
