            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" In logical terms, this can be written as:\n\nP \u2192 Q\n\nwhere P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\nWe are asked if we can infer the following statement from the original one: \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\" This new statement can be written as:\n\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nThis is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement has the same truth value as the statement itself. That is, if \"P \u2192 Q\" is true, then \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\" is also true.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,\" we can indeed infer that \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
