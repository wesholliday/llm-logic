            "content": "The statement given is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This can be represented in logical form as: A \u2192 C, where A represents \"Alex finished the race\" and C represents \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race\" from the given statement. This new statement can be represented as: \u00acC \u2192 \u00acA.\n\nTo determine if \u00acC \u2192 \u00acA can be inferred from A \u2192 C, we need to understand the relationship between these statements. The statement \u00acC \u2192 \u00acA is the contrapositive of the original statement A \u2192 C. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" (A \u2192 C), we can indeed infer \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race\" (\u00acC \u2192 \u00acA).\n\nAnswer: yes",
