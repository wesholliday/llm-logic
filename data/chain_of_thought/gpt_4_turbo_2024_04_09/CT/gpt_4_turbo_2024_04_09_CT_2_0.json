            "content": "To solve this, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" In logical form, this can be written as: \n\nG \u2192 U\n\nWhere:\nG = The griffin was in the forest\nU = The unicorn was in the forest\n\nThe question asks if we can infer the following statement from the original: \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n\n\u00acU \u2192 \u00acG\n\nThis is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement has the same truth value as the statement itself. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion of the original statement and swapping them. \n\nSo, the contrapositive of G \u2192 U is \u00acU \u2192 \u00acG. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest,\" we can indeed infer that \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
