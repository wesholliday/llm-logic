            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements given. The original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the alien visited Mars\" and Q is \"the robot visited Jupiter.\"\n\nThe original statement can be written symbolically as:\nP \u2192 Q\n\nWe are asked if we can infer the statement \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars\" from the original statement. This new statement can be written as:\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nThis is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement has the same truth value as the statement itself. That is, if \"If P, then Q\" is true, then \"If not Q, then not P\" is also true.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter,\" we can indeed infer that \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
