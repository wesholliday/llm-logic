This statement asserts that if \\( M \\) is true, then \\( S \\) must also be true.\n\nThe question asks whether from this statement we can infer \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\". This new statement can be represented as \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\), where \\( \\neg S \\) means \"Sue was not at the wedding\" and \\( \\neg M \\) means \"Mary was not at the wedding\".\n\nTo determine if \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) implies \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\), we need to consider the logical relationship between these statements. The statement \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) is known as the contrapositive of \\( M \\rightarrow S \\). In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. That is, if \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) is true, then \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\", we can indeed infer that \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
