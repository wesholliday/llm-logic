            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements given. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" In logical terms, this can be expressed as:\n\nP \u2192 Q\n\nWhere:\nP = The book was written by James\nQ = The book is a mystery novel\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion of the original conditional statement and then reversing them. So, the contrapositive of the original statement would be:\n\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nWhich translates to:\nIf the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel,\" we can indeed infer that \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
