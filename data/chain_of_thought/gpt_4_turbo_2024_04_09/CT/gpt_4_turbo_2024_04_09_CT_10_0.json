            "content": "To solve this, let's analyze the logical structure of the statements:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" In logical terms, this can be written as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"the dog was inside\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the cat was outside\".\n\n2. We need to determine if the following statement is logically equivalent or can be inferred: \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   where \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"the cat was not outside\" and \\( \\neg P \\) is \"the dog was not inside\".\n\n3. The statement \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is known as the contrapositive of the original statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent. That is, if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, then \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is also true.\n\n4. Therefore, from the original statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside,\" we can indeed infer that \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
