            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as:\n\nP \u2192 Q\n\nwhere P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer the statement \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\" from the original statement. This new statement can be represented as:\n\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nThis is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement has the same truth value as the statement itself. Therefore, if the original statement (P \u2192 Q) is true, then its contrapositive (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP) is also true.\n\nThus, from the statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue,\" we can indeed infer that \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
