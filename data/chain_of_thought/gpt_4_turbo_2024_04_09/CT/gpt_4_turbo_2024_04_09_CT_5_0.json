            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as:\n\nP \u2192 Q\n\nwhere P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nThe question asks whether we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\" In logical terms, this is represented as:\n\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement (P \u2192 Q) is true, then its contrapositive (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP) is also true.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis,\" we can indeed infer that \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
