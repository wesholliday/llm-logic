            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as:\n\nP \u2192 Q\n\nwhere P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer the statement \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\" from the original statement. This new statement can be represented as:\n\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nThis is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement has the same truth value as the statement itself. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion of the original statement and swapping them. \n\nSo, the contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. Since the contrapositive always has the same truth value as the original statement, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball,\" we can indeed infer that \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
