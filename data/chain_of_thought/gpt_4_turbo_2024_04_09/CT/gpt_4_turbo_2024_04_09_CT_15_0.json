That is, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true if and only if \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is true. Therefore, if the original statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
