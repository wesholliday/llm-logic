            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" In logical terms, this can be written as:\n\nP \u2192 Q\n\nwhere P represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q represents \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nThe question asks whether we can infer the following statement from the original one: \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\" This new statement can be written as:\n\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nThis is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement has the same truth value as the statement itself. That is, if the original statement (P \u2192 Q) is true, then its contrapositive (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP) is also true.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,\" we can indeed infer that \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
