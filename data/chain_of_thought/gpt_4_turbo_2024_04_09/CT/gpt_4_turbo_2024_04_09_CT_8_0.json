            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \\( V \\rightarrow M \\), where \\( V \\) represents \"the vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\nWe are asked to determine if we can infer the statement \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake\" from the original statement. This new statement can be represented as \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg V \\), where \\( \\neg M \\) represents \"the mummy was not awake\" and \\( \\neg V \\) represents \"the vampire was not awake.\"\n\nThe statement \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg V \\) is the contrapositive of the original statement \\( V \\rightarrow M \\). In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" we can indeed infer that \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
