This new statement can be represented as \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), where \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\" and \\( \\neg P \\) is \"Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nThe relationship between \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is known as contraposition. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. That is, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is logically equivalent to \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nTherefore, if the original statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
