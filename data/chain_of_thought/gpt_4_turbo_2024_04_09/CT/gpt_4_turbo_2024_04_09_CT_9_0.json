            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" In logical terms, this can be written as: \n   \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( M \\) represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The statement we need to evaluate is: \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg L \\)\n   where \\( \\neg M \\) represents \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" and \\( \\neg L \\) represents \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\n3. To determine if the second statement logically follows from the first, we need to check if \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) implies \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg L \\). This is a test of contraposition in logic, where the contrapositive of a statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. Since the contrapositive of \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) is indeed \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg L \\), and because a statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent, we can conclude that the second statement (\"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\") does indeed follow from the first statement (\"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\").\n\nAnswer: yes",
