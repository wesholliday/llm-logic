            "content": "To solve this, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" In logical form, this can be written as: \n\nP \u2192 Q\n\nwhere P is \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q is \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"P \u2192 Q\" is \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\" (If not Q, then not P).\n\nSo, the contrapositive of the original statement would be: \"If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\" This is written as:\n\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nSince the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the statement itself, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
