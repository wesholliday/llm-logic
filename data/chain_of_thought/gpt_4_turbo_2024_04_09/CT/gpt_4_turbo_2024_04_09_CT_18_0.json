            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" In logical terms, this can be written as:\n\nP \u2192 Q\n\nwhere P represents \"the doll was plastic\" and Q represents \"the truck was metal.\"\n\nWe are asked if we can infer the statement \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\" from the original statement. This new statement can be written as:\n\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nThis is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement has the same truth value as the statement itself. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion of the original statement and swapping them.\n\nSince the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the statement itself, if the original statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
