            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\" In logical terms, this can be written as: \n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"the wug was sproinged\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the wug was garpled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The wug was not garpled.\" This is the negation of \\( Q \\), written as:\n   \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. We need to determine whether these statements imply that \"The wug was not sproinged\" (\\( \\neg P \\)).\n\n4. Using the rules of logic, particularly modus tollens, we know that:\n   - If \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (if the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled)\n   - And \\( \\neg Q \\) (the wug was not garpled)\n   - Then \\( \\neg P \\) (the wug was not sproinged)\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can logically infer that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
