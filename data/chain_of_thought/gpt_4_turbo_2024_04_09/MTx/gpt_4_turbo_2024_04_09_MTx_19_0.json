This would mean P is false.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens, we know that if \"If P, then Q\" is true and Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\nThus, from the statements:\n- If the smonk was vreebled (P), then the smonk plagged (Q).\n- The smonk did not plagged (Q is false).\n\nWe can infer:\n- The smonk was not vreebled (P is false).\n\nAnswer: yes",
