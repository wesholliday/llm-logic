If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\n   - This can be represented as: If P, then Q. (P -> Q)\n\n2. The wug did not bim the zoint.\n   - This is the negation of Q, represented as: ~Q.\n\nWe need to determine if these statements allow us to infer that the wug was not flooped, which is the negation of P (~P).\n\nUsing the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens, we can infer the following:\n- If P -> Q (If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint)\n- ~Q (The wug did not bim the zoint)\n- Therefore, ~P (The wug was not flooped)\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can logically infer that the wug was not flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
