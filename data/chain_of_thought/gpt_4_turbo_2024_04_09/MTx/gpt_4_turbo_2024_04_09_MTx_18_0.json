This rule applies directly to our case:\n  - From \\( P \\rightarrow N \\) (if the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged),\n  - and \\( \\neg N \\) (the shank was not nugged),\n  - we can conclude \\( \\neg P \\) (the shank was not pooked).\n\nThus, based on the logical deduction using modus tollens, we can infer that the shank was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
