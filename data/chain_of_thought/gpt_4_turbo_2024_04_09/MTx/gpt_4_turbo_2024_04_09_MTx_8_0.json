            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" In logical terms, this can be written as: \n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the sprocket was daggled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The sprocket was not daggled.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if these statements together imply that \"The sprocket was not cranked\" (\\( \\neg P \\)).\n\n3. Using the rules of logic, particularly modus tollens, we can analyze the statements. Modus tollens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) are true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\n4. Applying modus tollens here:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled)\n   - \\( \\neg Q \\) (The sprocket was not daggled)\n   Therefore, \\( \\neg P \\) (The sprocket was not cranked) must be true.\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
