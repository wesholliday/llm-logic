However, we are given \\( \\neg Q \\) (the clug did not snugged). According to the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens, if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) are both true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\nThus, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can infer \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
