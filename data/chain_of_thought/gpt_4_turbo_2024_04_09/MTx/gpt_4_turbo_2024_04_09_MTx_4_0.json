            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given:\n\n1. \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If P, then Q. Here, P represents \"the fribble was snurgled\" and Q represents \"the fribble crinked.\"\n\n2. \"The fribble did not crink.\" This statement is the negation of Q, which we can denote as \u00acQ.\n\nWe are asked to determine if we can infer \"The fribble was not snurgled\" from these statements. This is the negation of P, denoted as \u00acP.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, particularly modus tollens, we can analyze the situation:\n- Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ), then we can conclude the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP).\n\nApplying modus tollens to the given statements:\n- We have the conditional statement: If P (the fribble was snurgled), then Q (the fribble crinked).\n- We also have \u00acQ (the fribble did not crink).\n\nTherefore, by modus tollens, we can conclude \u00acP (the fribble was not snurgled).\n\nAnswer: yes",
