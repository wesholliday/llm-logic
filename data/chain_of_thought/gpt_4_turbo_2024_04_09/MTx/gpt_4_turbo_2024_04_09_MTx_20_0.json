Here, P represents \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and Q represents \"it surned.\"\n\n2. \"The fleeg did not surn.\" This statement tells us that Q is false.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens (the method of denying), if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, then we can conclude that P is also false.\n\nApplying this to the statements:\n- From \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" (If P, then Q),\n- and \"The fleeg did not surn\" (Q is false),\n\nwe can conclude:\n- \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" (P is false).\n\nAnswer: yes",
