            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the logical principle known as modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument in propositional logic and can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. If P then Q (If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked)\n2. Not Q (The splat did not quank)\n3. Therefore, not P (Therefore, the splat was not morphed)\n\nGiven the statements:\n- If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\n- The splat did not quank.\n\nWe can apply modus tollens:\n- P represents \"the splat was morphed\"\n- Q represents \"the splat quanked\"\n\nSince it is given that \"the splat did not quank\" (Not Q), we can conclude \"the splat was not morphed\" (Not P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
