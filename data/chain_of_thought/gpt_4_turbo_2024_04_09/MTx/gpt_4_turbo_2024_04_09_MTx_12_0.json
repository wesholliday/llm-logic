(A \u2192 B)\n\n2. \"The smip did not lup the zoint.\"\n   This is the negation of B, represented as: Not B (\u00acB).\n\nWe need to determine if these statements allow us to infer \"The smip was not shripped,\" which is the negation of A (\u00acA).\n\nUsing the logical implication rule (modus tollens), if A implies B (A \u2192 B), and B is false (\u00acB), then A must also be false (\u00acA). \n\nApplying this to the given statements:\n- A \u2192 B (If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint)\n- \u00acB (The smip did not lup the zoint)\n\nFrom these, we can infer \u00acA (The smip was not shripped).\n\nAnswer: yes",
