The zinger was not smoogled. (Not S)\n\nWe are asked to determine if we can infer from these statements that the zinger was not fraggled (Not F).\n\nUsing the structure of logical implication and the information given:\n- The first statement is a conditional statement: If F (the zinger was fraggled), then S (the zinger was smoogled).\n- The second statement tells us that S is false (the zinger was not smoogled).\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens (the method of denying the consequent), we can infer the negation of the antecedent if the consequent is false. In simpler terms, if \"If F then S\" is true, and S is false, then F must also be false.\n\nThus, from the statements:\n- If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled. (If F, then S)\n- The zinger was not smoogled. (Not S)\n\nWe can logically conclude:\n- The zinger was not fraggled. (Not F)\n\nAnswer: yes",
