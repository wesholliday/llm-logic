Hard labor is an activity that can induce tiredness, regardless of how much sleep one has had.\n\nThe original statement does not account for the physical exertion from hard labor and its impact on tiredness. Therefore, the condition added in the new statement (doing hard labor) introduces a scenario not covered by the original statement.\n\nThus, we cannot infer the new statement from the original statement because the additional condition (hard labor) could independently lead to tiredness, which is not addressed in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
