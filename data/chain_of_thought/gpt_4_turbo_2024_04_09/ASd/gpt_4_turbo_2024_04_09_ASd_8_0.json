            "content": "To solve this, let's analyze the logical structure of the statements:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the package has shipped, then it will arrive today.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"the package has shipped\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the package will arrive today.\"\n\n2. The statement to be inferred is: \"If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( R \\) is \"the package was misrouted.\"\n\nWe need to determine if \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) logically follows from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\n3. Consider the truth table method or logical implications:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) asserts that whenever \\( P \\) is true, \\( Q \\) must also be true.\n   - \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) asserts that whenever both \\( P \\) and \\( R \\) are true, \\( Q \\) must also be true.\n\n4. Analyzing the implications:\n   - If \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, then every situation where \\( P \\) is true, \\( Q \\) is also true.\n   - However, adding the condition \\( R \\) (the package was misrouted) introduces a new variable that could potentially affect the truth of \\( Q \\). The original statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not account for any additional conditions (like misrouting) that might prevent \\( Q \\) from being true even if \\( P \\) is true.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - We cannot infer \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) without additional information about the effect of \\( R \\) (misrouting) on \\( Q \\) (arrival of the package). The misrouting could potentially delay or prevent the package from arriving today, which is not covered under the original condition \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
