            "content": "To solve this, let's analyze the logical structure of the statements:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the dog is in the yard, then it is barking.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"the dog is in the yard\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the dog is barking.\"\n\n2. The statement to be inferred is: \"If the dog is in the yard and it is asleep, then it is barking.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( R \\) is \"the dog is asleep.\"\n\nWe need to determine if \\( (P \\rightarrow Q) \\) logically implies \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\n3. Consider the truth table method:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true except when \\( P \\) is true and \\( Q \\) is false.\n   - \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) is true except when both \\( P \\) and \\( R \\) are true, and \\( Q \\) is false.\n\n4. Analyze a scenario:\n   - If the dog is in the yard and is asleep, it implies both \\( P \\) and \\( R \\) are true.\n   - According to \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), if \\( P \\) (dog is in the yard) is true, then \\( Q \\) (dog is barking) must be true.\n   - However, if the dog is asleep (\\( R \\) is true), it contradicts the possibility of the dog barking at the same time, suggesting that \\( Q \\) might be false while \\( P \\) and \\( R \\) are true.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - The presence of \\( R \\) (dog is asleep) introduces a condition where \\( Q \\) (dog is barking) could be false while \\( P \\) (dog is in the yard) is true.\n   - Therefore, \\( (P \\rightarrow Q) \\) does not necessarily imply \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) because the additional condition \\( R \\) can invalidate \\( Q \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
