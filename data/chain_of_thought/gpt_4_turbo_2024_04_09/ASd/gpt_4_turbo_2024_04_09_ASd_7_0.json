            "content": "To solve this, let's analyze the logical structure of the statements:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"the oven is on\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the kitchen is warm.\"\n\n2. The new statement to evaluate is: \"If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( R \\) is \"the pilot light is out.\"\n\nWe need to determine if \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) logically follows from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\n3. Consider the implications:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) means whenever \\( P \\) is true, \\( Q \\) must also be true.\n   - \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) means whenever both \\( P \\) and \\( R \\) are true, \\( Q \\) must also be true.\n\n4. If \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, then whenever \\( P \\) is true, \\( Q \\) is true regardless of the state of \\( R \\). This means that even if \\( R \\) (the pilot light is out) is true, as long as \\( P \\) (the oven is on) is true, \\( Q \\) (the kitchen is warm) must be true.\n\n5. Therefore, \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) does logically follow from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) because the truth of \\( Q \\) depends solely on \\( P \\), irrespective of \\( R \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
