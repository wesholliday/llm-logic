            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nPremise: If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A.\nSymbolically, this can be represented as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) where \\( P \\) is \"the essay is well-written\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the student will get an A\".\n\nConclusion: If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A.\nSymbolically, this can be represented as: \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) where \\( R \\) is \"the essay is turned in late\".\n\nThe question is whether \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) logically implies \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nTo analyze this, consider the truth table method or logical implications:\n1. \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) asserts that whenever \\( P \\) is true, \\( Q \\) must also be true.\n2. \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) asserts that whenever both \\( P \\) and \\( R \\) are true, \\( Q \\) must be true.\n\nIf \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, then whenever \\( P \\) is true, \\( Q \\) is true regardless of the truth value of \\( R \\). Therefore, even if \\( R \\) (the essay is turned in late) is true, as long as \\( P \\) (the essay is well-written) is true, \\( Q \\) (the student will get an A) must be true. Thus, \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) holds under the assumption that \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion under the same conditions.\n\nAnswer: yes",
