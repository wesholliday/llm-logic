            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The zibble must be wozzle zump\" specifies a particular condition or state of the zibble. To infer from this that \"The zibble must be wozzle zump and frazzle wozzle wibble\" introduces additional information (i.e., \"frazzle wozzle wibble\") that was not present in the original statement. Inference requires that the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises provided. Since the original statement does not mention or imply anything about \"frazzle wozzle wibble,\" we cannot logically infer the expanded statement from the original one without additional information that connects \"wozzle zump\" with \"frazzle wozzle wibble.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
