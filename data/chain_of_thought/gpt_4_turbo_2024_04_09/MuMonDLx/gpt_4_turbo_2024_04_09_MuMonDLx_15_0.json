            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The crunk must be zooble zibber grooble\" asserts a specific condition about \"the crunk.\" When considering the expanded statement \"The crunk must be zooble zibber grooble or blimple blurble flibbit,\" we are essentially adding an additional option to the original condition. In logic, if a statement A is true, then the statement \"A or B\" is also true, regardless of the truth value of B. This is because the \"or\" operator in logic (inclusive or) means that if either A, B, or both are true, then \"A or B\" is true. Since the original statement asserts that \"The crunk must be zooble zibber grooble\" is true, adding another option (\"blimple blurble flibbit\") does not negate the truth of the original statement but rather extends it. Therefore, the statement \"The crunk must be zooble zibber grooble or blimple blurble flibbit\" is logically true if \"The crunk must be zooble zibber grooble\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
