            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The frazzle must be froodle\" asserts a definite condition about the frazzle, specifically that it is froodle. When considering the statement \"The frazzle must be froodle or wobble,\" this is a broader condition. It includes the possibility of the frazzle being froodle, as well as the additional possibility of it being wobble. Since the original statement confirms that the frazzle is definitely froodle, it naturally fits within the expanded range of possibilities offered by the statement \"froodle or wobble.\" Therefore, if the frazzle must be froodle, it is also true that the frazzle could be froodle or wobble, because the inclusion of \"or wobble\" does not contradict the certainty of the frazzle being froodle; it merely adds another option that does not exclude the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
