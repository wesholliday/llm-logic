            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The floob must be snizzle a quank\" asserts a specific condition about the floob. When considering the statement \"The floob must be snizzle a quank or wobble,\" this introduces an additional possibility (wobble) to the original condition. In logic, if a statement is true, then that statement OR another statement is also true, because the original truth of the first statement is not negated by the addition of another option. Therefore, if it is true that \"The floob must be snizzle a quank,\" it is also true that \"The floob must be snizzle a quank or wobble,\" because the addition of \"or wobble\" does not invalidate the truth of the floob needing to be snizzle a quank.\n\nAnswer: yes",
