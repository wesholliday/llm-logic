However, it does not specify what happens if Alex does not finish the race; Chris could either finish or not finish the race in that scenario.\n\nC \u2192 A means that whenever Chris finishes the race, Alex must also finish the race. This is a different condition and focuses on Chris's finishing leading to Alex's finishing.\n\nThe truth of A \u2192 C does not guarantee the truth of C \u2192 A. For example, it is possible that Alex did not finish the race but Chris did, which would still satisfy A \u2192 C (since the condition A being true did not occur, the outcome of C is irrelevant to the truth of A \u2192 C). However, this scenario contradicts C \u2192 A, because Chris finishing the race did not ensure that Alex finished the race.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race,\" we cannot infer that \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
