            "content": "To analyze the inference, let's break down the given statement and the proposed inference:\n\nGiven statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\nThis statement can be symbolically represented as: M \u2192 S (where M stands for \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S stands for \"Sue was at the wedding\").\n\nProposed inference: \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\"\nThis statement can be symbolically represented as: S \u2192 M.\n\nTo determine if the inference is valid, we need to check if the truth of M \u2192 S necessarily implies the truth of S \u2192 M.\n\nM \u2192 S means that whenever Mary is at the wedding, Sue must also be at the wedding. However, it does not specify what happens when Mary is not at the wedding; Sue could either be at the wedding or not.\n\nS \u2192 M means that whenever Sue is at the wedding, Mary must also be at the wedding. This statement requires that Mary's presence is dependent on Sue's presence.\n\nThe truth of M \u2192 S does not guarantee the truth of S \u2192 M. For example, it is possible that Mary's presence always ensures Sue's presence (M \u2192 S), but there could be occasions where Sue is present and Mary is not, which would make S \u2192 M false.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" we cannot infer that \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
