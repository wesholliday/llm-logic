However, the implication \\( P \\implies Q \\) does not necessarily mean \\( Q \\implies P \\). The truth of \\( P \\) leading to \\( Q \\) does not imply that the truth of \\( Q \\) must come from \\( P \\). There could be other reasons why \\( Q \\) is true that do not involve \\( P \\).\n\nFor example, it's possible that Erin could take a train for reasons unrelated to whether Sam took a plane. Therefore, knowing \\( Q \\) (Erin took a train) does not necessarily allow us to conclude \\( P \\) (Sam took a plane).\n\nThus, from the statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train,\" we cannot infer that \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
