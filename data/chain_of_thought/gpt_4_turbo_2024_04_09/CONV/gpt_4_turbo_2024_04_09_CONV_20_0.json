The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" In logical terms, this can be expressed as: If A (apple is red), then B (banana is yellow).\n\nThe question asks if we can infer the converse of the original statement, which would be: \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\" In logical terms, this is: If B, then A.\n\nIn logic, the truth of a conditional statement (If A, then B) does not necessarily imply the truth of its converse (If B, then A). The truth of the original statement only tells us that whenever the apple is red, the banana is yellow. It does not tell us that the banana being yellow is a condition that guarantees the apple is red. There could be other conditions where the banana is yellow but the apple is not red.\n\nTherefore, without additional information, we cannot infer that the converse of the statement is true based solely on the truth of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
