In logic, the truth of \"If P then Q\" does not automatically imply the truth of \"If Q then P\". The original statement only tells us that being written by James guarantees the book is a mystery novel, but it does not imply that every mystery novel must have been written by James. There could be other authors who also write mystery novels.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
