            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the statements given:\n\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This can be represented as: If M, then S. (Where M = Mary was at the wedding, S = Sue was at the wedding).\n\n2. \"Sue might not have been at the wedding.\" This suggests that it is not certain that Sue was at the wedding; Sue's presence is not guaranteed. This can be represented as: It is possible that not S.\n\nFrom these statements, we need to determine if we can infer \"Mary was not at the wedding\" (not M).\n\nUsing the first statement, if M (Mary was at the wedding), then S (Sue must have been at the wedding) must be true. However, the second statement introduces the possibility that Sue might not have been at the wedding (possible not S).\n\nIf it is possible that not S (Sue might not have been at the wedding), and if M implies S (Mary being at the wedding implies Sue must have been at the wedding), then the possibility that Sue was not at the wedding (possible not S) would imply that Mary could not have been at the wedding (not M) because if Mary were there, Sue would have to be there.\n\nThus, from the possibility that Sue might not have been at the wedding, we can infer that it is also possible that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
