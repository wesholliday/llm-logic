It can be represented as: If C (cake was chocolate), then B (muffins were blueberry).\n\n2. \"The muffins might not have been blueberry.\"\n   - This statement suggests that it is possible that B is false (muffins were not blueberry).\n\nFrom these statements, we need to determine if we can infer \"The cake was not chocolate\" (not C).\n\nUsing the logic of the conditional statement:\n- If C (cake was chocolate) implies B (muffins were blueberry), then the contrapositive is also true: If not B (muffins were not blueberry), then not C (cake was not chocolate).\n\nGiven that \"The muffins might not have been blueberry\" suggests the possibility of not B, we can infer that it is also possible that not C (the cake was not chocolate). However, since the statement about the muffins allows for the possibility but does not confirm it, we cannot definitively conclude not C based solely on the possibility of not B. We only know that if the muffins definitely were not blueberry, then the cake definitely was not chocolate.\n\nSince the statement about the muffins does not confirm that they were not blueberry, but only suggests it as a possibility, we cannot definitively infer that \"The cake was not chocolate\" based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
