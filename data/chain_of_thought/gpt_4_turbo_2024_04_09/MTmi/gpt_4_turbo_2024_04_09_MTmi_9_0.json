            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the statements given:\n\n1. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\n   This statement can be represented as: If L (Lisa bought the red shirt), then M (Mark bought the blue shirt). In logical terms, this is L \u2192 M.\n\n2. \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\"\n   This statement suggests that it is possible that M is false (Mark did not buy the blue shirt).\n\nFrom these statements, we need to determine if we can infer that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" (\u00acL).\n\nUsing the implication from the first statement (L \u2192 M), we know that if L is true, then M must also be true. However, the second statement tells us that it is possible that M is false. \n\nIf M is possibly false, and knowing that L \u2192 M (if L then M), then L must also be false to maintain the truth of the implication. This is because if L were true, M would necessarily have to be true, which contradicts the possibility of M being false.\n\nTherefore, from the possibility that M is false and the implication L \u2192 M, we can infer that L is false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
