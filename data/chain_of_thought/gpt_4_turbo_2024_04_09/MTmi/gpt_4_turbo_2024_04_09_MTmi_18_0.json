            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the given statements.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"The doll was plastic\" and \\( M \\) represents \"The truck was metal.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The truck might not have been metal.\" This suggests the possibility that \\( M \\) is false, or \\( \\neg M \\).\n\n3. We need to determine if these statements together imply that \"The doll was not plastic\" (\\( \\neg P \\)).\n\n4. From the conditional \\( P \\rightarrow M \\), we know that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must also be true. However, since \\( M \\) might be false (\\( \\neg M \\)), we need to consider whether \\( P \\) can still be true under this condition.\n\n5. If \\( P \\) were true, then \\( M \\) would necessarily be true because of the conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow M \\). However, since it is possible that \\( M \\) is false, \\( P \\) being true would contradict the possibility of \\( \\neg M \\).\n\n6. Therefore, if \\( \\neg M \\) is possible, \\( P \\) must be false to avoid contradiction. This means that \"The doll was not plastic\" (\\( \\neg P \\)) follows from the possibility that \"The truck might not have been metal\" (\\( \\neg M \\)) and the conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow M \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
