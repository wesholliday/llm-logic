            "content": "To solve this, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given:\n\n1. The first statement is: \"If the plim is grobbled, then the whiffle will sploosh.\" This can be represented as: If P, then W.\n\n2. The second statement to evaluate is: \"If the plim is grobbled and the drazzle is drooped, then the whiffle will sploosh.\" This can be represented as: If P and D, then W.\n\nWe need to determine if the second statement logically follows from the first.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that whenever the plim is grobbled (P), the whiffle will sploosh (W). The second statement adds an additional condition (the drazzle is drooped, D) to the occurrence of P (the plim is grobbled).\n\nIn logical terms, if we know that P implies W, adding another condition (D) alongside P (making it P and D) does not change the truth of W following from P. This is because the occurrence of W is already guaranteed by P alone, regardless of the truth value of D.\n\nThus, if \"If P, then W\" is true, then \"If P and D, then W\" is also true, because W is already ensured by P, and the additional condition D does not affect the outcome.\n\nAnswer: yes",
