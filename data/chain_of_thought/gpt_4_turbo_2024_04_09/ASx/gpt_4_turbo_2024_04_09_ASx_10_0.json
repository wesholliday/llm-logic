            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the klank is hooped, then the wuggy will zink.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"the klank is hooped\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the wuggy will zink.\"\n\n2. The statement to be inferred is: \"If the klank is hooped and the wuggy is out of zloat, then the wuggy will zink.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( R \\) is \"the wuggy is out of zloat.\"\n\n3. To determine if \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), consider the following:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) asserts that whenever \\( P \\) is true, \\( Q \\) must also be true.\n   - \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) asserts that whenever both \\( P \\) and \\( R \\) are true, \\( Q \\) must also be true.\n\n4. If \\( P \\) alone being true is sufficient to guarantee \\( Q \\), then adding another condition (\\( R \\)) alongside \\( P \\) (i.e., \\( P \\land R \\)) does not invalidate the guarantee that \\( Q \\) will be true. This is because the truth of \\( Q \\) is already established by the truth of \\( P \\), regardless of the truth value of \\( R \\).\n\n5. Therefore, if \"the klank is hooped\" alone is enough to ensure \"the wuggy will zink,\" then \"the klank is hooped and the wuggy is out of zloat\" (which includes the condition that \"the klank is hooped\") will also ensure \"the wuggy will zink.\"\n\nBased on this reasoning:\n\nAnswer: yes",
