            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If the tizzer is on, then the goom is snurpled.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\( T \\rightarrow G \\)\n   where \\( T \\) represents \"the tizzer is on\" and \\( G \\) represents \"the goom is snurpled.\"\n\n2. The question asks whether from this statement we can infer: \"If the tizzer is on and the plink light is out, then the goom is snurpled.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\( (T \\land P) \\rightarrow G \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"the plink light is out.\"\n\n3. To determine if \\( (T \\land P) \\rightarrow G \\) can be inferred from \\( T \\rightarrow G \\), consider the logical structure. The original statement \\( T \\rightarrow G \\) asserts that whenever \\( T \\) is true, \\( G \\) must also be true. \n\n4. The new statement \\( (T \\land P) \\rightarrow G \\) asserts that when both \\( T \\) and \\( P \\) are true, \\( G \\) must be true. However, since \\( T \\rightarrow G \\) already establishes that \\( G \\) is true whenever \\( T \\) is true, regardless of the truth value of \\( P \\), the truth of \\( G \\) does not depend on \\( P \\).\n\n5. Therefore, if \\( T \\) is true (the tizzer is on), \\( G \\) (the goom is snurpled) must be true according to the original statement. Adding the condition \\( P \\) (the plink light is out) does not change the truth of \\( G \\) because \\( G \\) is already guaranteed by \\( T \\) alone.\n\n6. Thus, \\( (T \\land P) \\rightarrow G \\) is a valid inference from \\( T \\rightarrow G \\) because the additional condition \\( P \\) does not affect the outcome that \\( G \\) must be true whenever \\( T \\) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
