            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the frizzle is dinked, then the zarp will splunk.\" This can be represented in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"the frizzle is dinked\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the zarp will splunk\".\n\n2. The statement to be inferred is: \"If the frizzle is dinked and the sklonk is grooped, then the zarp will splunk.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( R \\) is \"the sklonk is grooped\".\n\n3. We need to determine if \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) logically follows from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\n4. According to the rules of logic, if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, then whenever \\( P \\) is true, \\( Q \\) must also be true. Adding an additional condition to \\( P \\) (i.e., \\( R \\)) to form \\( (P \\land R) \\) does not invalidate the truth of \\( Q \\) when \\( P \\) is true. In other words, if \\( P \\) being true alone is sufficient for \\( Q \\) to be true, then \\( P \\) being true along with another true statement \\( R \\) (which has no stated effect on \\( Q \\)) still results in \\( Q \\) being true.\n\n5. Therefore, \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) is a valid inference from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), because the truth of \\( Q \\) is guaranteed by the truth of \\( P \\), regardless of the truth value of \\( R \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
