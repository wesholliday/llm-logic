The given statement is: \"If the trankle is sploofed, then the zorple will quibble.\"\n   - This can be represented as: If A, then B.\n\n2. The statement to infer is: \"If the trankle is sploofed and the drib is flanked, then the zorple will quibble.\"\n   - This can be represented as: If A and C, then B.\n\nWe need to determine if the second statement (If A and C, then B) logically follows from the first statement (If A, then B).\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that whenever A happens (the trankle is sploofed), B happens (the zorple will quibble). The second statement adds an additional condition C (the drib is flanked) to A, but since the occurrence of B is solely dependent on A and not on C, the truth of B (the zorple will quibble) is already guaranteed by the occurrence of A alone, regardless of whether C is true.\n\nTherefore, adding the condition C does not affect the outcome of B. If A is true (the trankle is sploofed), B will be true (the zorple will quibble) regardless of the truth value of C (whether the drib is flanked or not).\n\nThus, the second statement logically follows from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
