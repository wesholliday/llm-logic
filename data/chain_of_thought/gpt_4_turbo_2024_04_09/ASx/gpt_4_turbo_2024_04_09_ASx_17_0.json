            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given and the inference we are asked to evaluate.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the glop is on the brink, then the skrizzle is plonked.\" This can be represented in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"the glop is on the brink\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the skrizzle is plonked.\"\n\n2. The statement we need to evaluate is: \"If the glop is on the brink and the bloop is zorped, then the skrizzle is plonked.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( R \\) is \"the bloop is zorped.\"\n\n3. To determine if \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) is a valid inference from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), consider the following:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) asserts that whenever \\( P \\) is true, \\( Q \\) must also be true.\n   - \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) asserts that whenever both \\( P \\) and \\( R \\) are true, \\( Q \\) must be true.\n\n4. If \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, then any situation where \\( P \\) is true will guarantee that \\( Q \\) is true, regardless of the truth value of \\( R \\). This means that even when \\( R \\) (the bloop is zorped) is added to the condition, as long as \\( P \\) (the glop is on the brink) holds, \\( Q \\) (the skrizzle is plonked) will still be true.\n\n5. Therefore, adding the condition \\( R \\) does not affect the truth of \\( Q \\) as long as \\( P \\) remains true. Thus, \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) is a valid inference from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
