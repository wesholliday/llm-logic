The statement to infer is \"If the snark was blimmed and sproinged, then it flooped\":\n   If B and S (snark was blimmed and sproinged), then F (it flooped).\n\nWe know from the original statement that whenever B is true, F is also true. The new statement adds the condition S (sproinged) to B, but since F follows from B alone, the addition of S does not affect the truth of F. \n\nThus, if B is true (snark was blimmed), F (it flooped) must be true, regardless of whether S (sproinged) is true or not. Therefore, if both B and S are true, F is still true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
