            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If the zibble is zapped, then the glorp will zoon.\" This can be represented as: If A, then B.\n\n2. The second statement to evaluate is: \"If the zibble is zapped and the quib is squinked, then the glorp will zoon.\" This can be represented as: If A and C, then B.\n\n3. We need to determine if the second statement logically follows from the first. The first statement asserts that whenever A happens (the zibble is zapped), B will occur (the glorp will zoon). \n\n4. The second statement adds an additional condition C (the quib is squinked) to A, but still concludes B. According to the rules of logic, if B always follows A, then B will still occur even if another condition C is true at the same time as A. This is because the occurrence of B is solely dependent on A, regardless of C.\n\n5. Therefore, if \"If the zibble is zapped, then the glorp will zoon\" is true, then \"If the zibble is zapped and the quib is squinked, then the glorp will zoon\" must also be true, because the addition of another condition (C) does not affect the outcome that follows from A.\n\nAnswer: yes",
