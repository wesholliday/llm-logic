            "content": "To solve this, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the ploofle is blorped, then the fliggle will get a nurple.\" This can be represented as: If A, then B.\n\n2. The statement to infer is: \"If the ploofle is blorped and zooned, then the fliggle will get a nurple.\" This can be represented as: If A and C, then B.\n\n3. We know from the original statement that whenever A happens (the ploofle is blorped), B happens (the fliggle gets a nurple). \n\n4. The statement to infer adds an additional condition C (the ploofle is zooned) to A. However, since B happens whenever A happens, regardless of any additional conditions, B will still occur whenever A occurs, even if C is also true.\n\n5. Therefore, if A (ploofle is blorped) is sufficient to cause B (fliggle gets a nurple), then A and C (ploofle is blorped and zooned) will also cause B, because the occurrence of B is already guaranteed by the occurrence of A alone.\n\nAnswer: yes",
