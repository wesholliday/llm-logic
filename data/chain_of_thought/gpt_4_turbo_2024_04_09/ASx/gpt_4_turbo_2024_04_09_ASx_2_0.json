The first statement is: \"If we crink the snoogle, then we'll pook a nurp.\" This can be represented as: If A, then B.\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If we crink the snoogle and a wug zites, then we'll plook a nurp.\" This can be represented as: If A and C, then B.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that crinking the snoogle (A) is a sufficient condition for plooking a nurp (B). This means whenever A happens, B will definitely happen.\n\nThe second statement adds an additional condition to A (i.e., A and C). However, since we already know that A alone is sufficient to cause B, the occurrence of C (wug zites) alongside A does not affect the outcome of B. The truth of B is already guaranteed by the occurrence of A, regardless of whether C happens or not.\n\nTherefore, if \"crinking the snoogle\" alone is enough to \"plook a nurp,\" then \"crinking the snoogle\" while \"a wug zites\" is also enough to \"plook a nurp,\" because the additional condition (C) does not negate or interfere with the outcome already established by A.\n\nAnswer: yes",
