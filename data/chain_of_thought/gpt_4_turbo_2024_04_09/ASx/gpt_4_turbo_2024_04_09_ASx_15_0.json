            "content": "To solve this, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given:\n\n1. The first statement is: \"If the glunk snarbles, then the blip will be floinked.\" This can be represented in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"the glunk snarbles\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the blip will be floinked\".\n\n2. The second statement to evaluate is: \"If the glunk snarbles and the troon is zibbled, then the blip will be floinked.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( R \\) is \"the troon is zibbled\".\n\nWe need to determine if \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) can be logically inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nFrom \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), we know that whenever \\( P \\) (the glunk snarbles) is true, \\( Q \\) (the blip will be floinked) must also be true. \n\nNow, consider \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\). This statement asserts that if both \\( P \\) (the glunk snarbles) and \\( R \\) (the troon is zibbled) are true, then \\( Q \\) (the blip will be floinked) will be true. Since we already know from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) that the truth of \\( P \\) alone is sufficient to guarantee the truth of \\( Q \\), the additional condition \\( R \\) (the troon is zibbled) does not affect the outcome regarding \\( Q \\). Therefore, \\( Q \\) will still be true whenever \\( P \\) is true, regardless of the truth value of \\( R \\).\n\nThus, \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) can indeed be logically inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) because the truth of \\( P \\) alone is sufficient to ensure the truth of \\( Q \\), and adding another condition with \\( P \\) (like \\( R \\)) does not change the truth of \\( Q \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
