            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package might be delivered today or tomorrow\" suggests that there are two possibilities for the delivery of the package: it could be delivered today, or it could be delivered tomorrow. The use of \"might\" indicates uncertainty but allows for the possibility of either day being the delivery date. Therefore, if it is possible that the package could be delivered tomorrow, as stated in the original sentence, then the inference that \"The package might be delivered tomorrow\" is a valid one. It is directly supported by the original statement which includes tomorrow as a potential delivery date.\n\nAnswer: yes",
