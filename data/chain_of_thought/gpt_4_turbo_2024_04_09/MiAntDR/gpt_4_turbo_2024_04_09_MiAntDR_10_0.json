            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document might be signed or notarized\" suggests two possibilities for the status of the document: it might be signed, or it might be notarized. This statement does not specify that both conditions must be met, nor does it exclude the possibility of either condition being true independently. Therefore, from this statement, it is reasonable to infer that there is a possibility that the document might be notarized, as this is one of the options explicitly mentioned.\n\nAnswer: yes",
