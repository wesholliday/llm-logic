This does not confirm that the sprocket is definitely not daggled, but it remains a possibility.\n\nStatement 2 presents a conditional choice: either the sprocket is cranked, or it must be daggled. This is an either/or scenario.\n\nGiven that it is possible (from statement 1) that the sprocket is not daggled, we must consider the alternative in statement 2 to maintain the truth of the overall scenario. If the sprocket might not be daggled, and the only other option provided by statement 2 is that the sprocket is cranked, then the sprocket must be cranked to satisfy the condition presented in statement 2.\n\nThus, if the sprocket might not be daggled, the only remaining logical conclusion under the conditions provided is that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
