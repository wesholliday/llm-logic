The second statement then presents a scenario where if the fribble is not crinked, the only other option provided is that the fribble must be snurgled. Since we know from the first statement that it's possible the fribble is not crinked, and the second statement offers only two possibilities (snurgled or must be crinked), the possibility of the fribble not being crinked leads directly to the conclusion that the fribble must be snurgled.\n\nTherefore, given the information and the logical connection between the two statements, we can infer:\n\nAnswer: yes",
