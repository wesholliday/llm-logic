If the wug is not garpled, then based on statement 2, the only remaining possibility to satisfy the disjunction is that the wug is sproinged.\n\nTherefore, given that it is possible for the wug not to be garpled, and given the disjunction that if it is not garpled, it must be sproinged, we can infer that the wug must be sproinged to satisfy the conditions of the statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
