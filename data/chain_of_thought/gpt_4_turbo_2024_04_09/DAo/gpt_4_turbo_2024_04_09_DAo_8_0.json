            "content": "To solve this, we can analyze the given statements using logical reasoning:\n\n1. The first statement is \"The vampire was not awake.\" We can denote this as \\( V = \\text{false} \\).\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" In logical terms, this can be written as \\( V \\implies M \\), where \\( V \\) is \"the vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) is \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\n3. The truth table for the implication \\( V \\implies M \\) is such that the implication is true in all cases except where \\( V \\) is true and \\( M \\) is false. Given that \\( V \\) is false (from statement 1), the implication \\( V \\implies M \\) is true regardless of the truth value of \\( M \\). This is because an implication with a false antecedent (\\( V \\)) is always true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent (\\( M \\)).\n\n4. Since the truth of \\( M \\) (whether the mummy was awake or not) does not affect the truth of the implication when \\( V \\) is false, we cannot determine the truth value of \\( M \\) based solely on these statements. The mummy could be either awake or not awake without affecting the truth of the given statements.\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"The vampire was not awake\" and \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" we cannot infer that \"The mummy was not awake.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
