            "content": "To solve this, let's analyze the statements given:\n\n1. Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n2. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement. It can be written in logical form as:\n- If P (Lisa bought the red shirt), then Q (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that P is false (Lisa did not buy the red shirt).\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If P then Q\" is considered true if:\n- Both P and Q are true, or\n- P is false (regardless of Q).\n\nSince P is false (Lisa did not buy the red shirt), the conditional statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true regardless of whether Q (Mark bought the blue shirt) is true or false.\n\nTherefore, from the information given, we cannot determine the truth value of Q (whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not) based solely on the falsity of P (Lisa did not buy the red shirt). The truth of the conditional statement does not depend on Q when P is false.\n\nAnswer: no",
