Statement 2 is a conditional statement that says if the doll was plastic, then the truck would be metal. However, since the doll is not plastic, the condition for the statement is not met. \n\nThe conditional statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" does not tell us what happens when the doll is not plastic. It only specifies the outcome (the truck being metal) under the condition that the doll is plastic. Since this condition is false, the statement does not provide any information about the state of the truck when the doll is not plastic.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer anything about the truck being metal or not metal based solely on these statements. The truth of the truck being metal or not is independent of the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
