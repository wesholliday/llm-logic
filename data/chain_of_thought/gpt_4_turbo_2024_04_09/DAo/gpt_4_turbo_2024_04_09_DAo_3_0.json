Statement 2 is a conditional statement that says if James did write the book, then it would be a mystery novel. However, since we know from statement 1 that James did not write the book, the condition in statement 2 is not met.\n\nThe fact that James did not write the book does not provide any information about the genre of the book when the condition (James writing the book) is not met. The genre of the book could still be a mystery novel or it could be any other genre. Therefore, we cannot infer that the book is not a mystery novel based solely on these statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
