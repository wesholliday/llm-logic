It tells us about what would be true if the griffin were in the forest. Since we know from statement 1 that the griffin was not in the forest, the condition for statement 2 is not met. Therefore, statement 2 does not provide any information about the situation where the griffin is not in the forest.\n\nSince statement 2 only tells us about the scenario where the griffin is in the forest, it does not help us determine the location of the unicorn when the griffin is not in the forest. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the presence or absence of the unicorn in the forest based solely on these statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
