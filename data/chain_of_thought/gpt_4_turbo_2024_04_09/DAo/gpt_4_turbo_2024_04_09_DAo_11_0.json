            "content": "To solve this, let's analyze the statements given:\n\n1. \"The cake was not chocolate.\"\n2. \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nThe first statement clearly tells us that the cake was not chocolate. \n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement. It says that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would be blueberry. However, since we know from the first statement that the cake was not chocolate, the condition in the second statement (the cake being chocolate) is not met.\n\nIn logic, when the condition of a conditional statement is false, the entire conditional statement is considered true regardless of the truth value of the consequence. This is known as vacuous truth. Therefore, the truth of the statement \"the muffins were blueberry\" is not determined by the given statements because the condition that would guarantee the muffins being blueberry (the cake being chocolate) did not occur.\n\nThus, from the information given, we cannot infer that the muffins were not blueberry; they might be blueberry or they might not be, but the given statements do not provide enough information to conclude definitively either way.\n\nAnswer: no",
