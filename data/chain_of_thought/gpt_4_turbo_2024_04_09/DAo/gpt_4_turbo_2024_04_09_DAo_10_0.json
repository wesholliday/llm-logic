The truth of Q is independent in this scenario because the condition P that would guarantee Q is not met.\n\nTherefore, from the information given, we cannot infer that \"The cat was not outside\" just because \"The dog was not inside.\" The status of the cat being outside or not is not determinable with the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
