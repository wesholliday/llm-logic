            "content": "To determine whether we can infer \"Sue was not at the wedding\" from the given statements, let's analyze the logic:\n\n1. The first statement is \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" This is a straightforward assertion about Mary's absence.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This statement sets a condition that links Mary's attendance to Sue's attendance. It implies that Sue's attendance at the wedding is dependent on Mary's attendance.\n\n3. To infer \"Sue was not at the wedding,\" we need to establish that Sue's attendance is impossible or unlikely given the truth of the first two statements.\n\n4. The conditional statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" can be analyzed using the truth table for implications. The implication is true in all cases except where the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) is true and the consequent (Sue was at the wedding) is false. Since we know Mary was not at the wedding, the condition set by the antecedent is not met.\n\n5. Because the antecedent of the conditional statement is false (Mary was not at the wedding), the truth of the consequent (whether Sue was at the wedding or not) is not determined by this conditional statement. The implication holds regardless of Sue's attendance.\n\n6. Therefore, from the information given (\"Mary was not at the wedding\" and \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\"), we cannot logically infer that \"Sue was not at the wedding.\" Sue's attendance or non-attendance is not logically dictated by the statements provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
