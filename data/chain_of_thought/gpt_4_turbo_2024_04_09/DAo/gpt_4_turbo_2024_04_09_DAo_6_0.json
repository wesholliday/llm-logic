If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n\nWe need to determine if these statements allow us to infer that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n\\[ P \\implies Q \\]\nwhere \\( P \\) is \"Sue chose pizza\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\nGiven that Sue did not choose pizza (\\( \\neg P \\)), we need to determine the truth value of \\( Q \\) (Bob chose pasta).\n\nThe truth table for a conditional statement \\( P \\implies Q \\) is:\n- \\( P \\) true, \\( Q \\) true \u2192 \\( P \\implies Q \\) is true.\n- \\( P \\) true, \\( Q \\) false \u2192 \\( P \\implies Q \\) is false.\n- \\( P \\) false, \\( Q \\) true \u2192 \\( P \\implies Q \\) is true.\n- \\( P \\) false, \\( Q \\) false \u2192 \\( P \\implies Q \\) is true.\n\nFrom the truth table, we see that when \\( P \\) is false (Sue did not choose pizza), \\( P \\implies Q \\) is true regardless of the truth value of \\( Q \\) (whether Bob chose pasta or not). Therefore, the truth value of \\( Q \\) (Bob chose pasta) is independent of \\( P \\) being false. Bob could have chosen pasta or not, and it would not affect the truth of the conditional statement given Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nThus, from the information given, we cannot infer that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: no",
