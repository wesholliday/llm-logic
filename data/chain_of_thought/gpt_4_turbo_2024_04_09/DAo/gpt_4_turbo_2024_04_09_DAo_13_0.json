            "content": "To solve this, let's analyze the statements given:\n\n1. \"The car was not red.\"\n2. \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\n\nThe first statement clearly tells us the car's color is not red. The second statement is a conditional statement that says if the car was red, then the truck would be blue. \n\nSince we know from the first statement that the car was not red, the condition for the second statement (the car being red) is false. In logic, if the premise of a conditional statement (if-then statement) is false, the entire statement is considered true regardless of the truth value of the conclusion. This is known as vacuous truth.\n\nHowever, knowing that the conditional statement is true does not provide us with any information about the actual color of the truck when the car is not red. The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" does not imply anything about the color of the truck when the car is not red. Therefore, we cannot infer the color of the truck based solely on these statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
