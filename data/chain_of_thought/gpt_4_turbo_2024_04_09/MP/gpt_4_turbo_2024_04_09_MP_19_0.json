            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be represented as: If P, then Q.\n\n2. The second statement is a factual statement: \"Tom watched football.\" This is represented as: P.\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\n4. Applying modus ponens to the statements given:\n   - If P (Tom watched football), then Q (Jen watched basketball).\n   - P (Tom watched football) is true.\n   - Therefore, Q (Jen watched basketball) must also be true.\n\nBased on this logical deduction, we can infer that \"Jen watched basketball\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
