The cake was chocolate.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as: If P, then Q. Here, P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms that P (\"the cake was chocolate\") is true.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, then we can conclude that Q is also true.\n\nTherefore, from the statements provided, we can infer that \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
