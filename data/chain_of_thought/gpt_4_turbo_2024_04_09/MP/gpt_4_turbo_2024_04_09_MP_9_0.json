            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as: If L, then M. Here, L stands for \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and M stands for \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The second statement is a factual statement: \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\" This confirms that L is true.\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if we have a conditional statement (If L, then M) and the antecedent (L) is true, then the consequent (M) must also be true.\n\n4. Therefore, since L is true (\"Lisa bought the red shirt\"), and the conditional statement (If L, then M) holds, we can conclude that M is also true (\"Mark bought the blue shirt\").\n\nAnswer: yes",
