Here, A represents \"Alex finished the race\" and C represents \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\nThe second statement asserts that A is true (\"Alex finished the race\").\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if we have a conditional statement (If A, then C) and the antecedent (A) is true, then the consequent (C) must also be true.\n\nApplying this rule here:\n- We know \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" (If A, then C).\n- We also know \"Alex finished the race\" (A is true).\n\nTherefore, by modus ponens, \"Chris finished the race\" (C) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
