Here, P is \"the alien visited Mars\" and Q is \"the robot visited Jupiter.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms that P (\"the alien visited Mars\") is true.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if we have a conditional statement (If P then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, since the antecedent (\"the alien visited Mars\") is true, the consequent (\"the robot visited Jupiter\") must also be true based on the conditional statement provided.\n\nAnswer: yes",
