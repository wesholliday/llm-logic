            "content": "The question involves a logical inference based on a conditional statement and a premise. The conditional statement given is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be represented as: If P, then Q. Here, P represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe additional information provided is \"Mary was at the wedding,\" which affirms that P is true.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the antecedent (P) is affirmed to be true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, since it is given that \"Mary was at the wedding\" (P is true), and the conditional statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" (If P, then Q), we can logically infer that \"Sue was at the wedding\" (Q is true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
