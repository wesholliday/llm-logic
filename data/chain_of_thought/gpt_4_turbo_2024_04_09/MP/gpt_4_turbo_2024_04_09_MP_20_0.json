            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given:\n\n1. \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" - This is a conditional statement where the truth of the banana being yellow is dependent on the apple being red.\n\n2. \"The apple was red\" - This is a statement of fact.\n\nThe structure of the argument is a classic example of modus ponens, a form of argument in logic. Modus ponens has the following form:\n- If P, then Q.\n- P.\n- Therefore, Q.\n\nApplying this to the given statements:\n- If the apple was red (P), then the banana was yellow (Q).\n- The apple was red (P).\n- Therefore, the banana was yellow (Q).\n\nSince the premises logically lead to the conclusion following the rules of modus ponens, we can infer that the banana was yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
