Here, P represents \"the vampire was awake\" and Q represents \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms that P (\"the vampire was awake\") is true.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, then we can conclude that Q must also be true.\n\nApplying this to the given statements:\n- From statement 1, we know \"If the vampire was awake (P), then the mummy was awake (Q).\"\n- From statement 2, we know \"The vampire was awake (P).\"\n\nTherefore, by modus ponens, we can conclude \"The mummy was awake (Q).\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
