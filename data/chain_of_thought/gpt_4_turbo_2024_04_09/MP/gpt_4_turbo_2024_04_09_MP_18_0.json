            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be represented as: If P, then Q.\n\nThe second statement is: \"The doll was plastic.\" This is represented as P.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nHere, P represents \"The doll was plastic\" and Q represents \"The truck was metal.\" Since the statement \"The doll was plastic\" (P) is given as true, and we know \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" (If P, then Q), we can conclude that \"The truck was metal\" (Q) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
