Here, P represents \"Joe went to the park\" and Q represents \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nGiven the additional information that \"Joe went to the park\" (P is true), we can apply the rule of modus ponens in logic, which states that if a conditional statement (If P, then Q) is true and its antecedent (P) is true, then its consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, since the conditional statement is given as true and its antecedent is also true, we can conclude that the consequent, \"Lucy went to the zoo\" (Q), is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
