The shirt was cotton.\n\nWe are asked to infer whether the pants were denim.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\nIf P, then Q.\n\nWhere:\nP = The shirt was cotton\nQ = The pants were denim\n\nThe second statement affirms that P (the shirt was cotton) is true.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nSince the antecedent (The shirt was cotton) is true, the consequent (The pants were denim) must also be true based on the conditional statement provided.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the pants were denim.\n\nAnswer: yes",
