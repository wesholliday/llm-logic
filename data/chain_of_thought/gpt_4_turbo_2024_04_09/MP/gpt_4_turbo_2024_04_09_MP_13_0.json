            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given:\n\n1. \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\n2. \"The car was red.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement. It can be represented as: If P, then Q. Here, P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\nThe second statement affirms that P (\"the car was red\") is true.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus ponens, if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nThus, from the statements provided:\n- \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" (If P, then Q)\n- \"The car was red\" (P is true)\n\nWe can logically infer:\n- \"The truck was blue\" (Q is true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
