            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\n2. The second premise is a straightforward statement affirming the antecedent of the first premise: \"Jeff played basketball.\" Symbolically, this is \\( P \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn from these premises is \"Amy played tennis,\" which is \\( Q \\).\n\nThe argument structure here is known as modus ponens, a common form of argument in logic. Modus ponens has the following form:\n- If \\( P \\) then \\( Q \\) (conditional statement)\n- \\( P \\) (affirmation of the antecedent)\n- Therefore, \\( Q \\) (conclusion follows necessarily)\n\nGiven that the premises are:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- \\( P \\)\n\nThe conclusion \\( Q \\) necessarily follows. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
