            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be symbolically represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"The doll was plastic\" and Q is \"The truck was metal.\"\n\n2. The second premise is a statement of fact: \"The doll was plastic.\" This is simply P.\n\n3. The conclusion drawn from these premises is \"The truck was metal,\" which is Q.\n\nThe argument structure here is a classic example of modus ponens, a common form of deductive reasoning. Modus ponens has the following form:\n   - If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q)\n   - P\n   - Therefore, Q\n\nGiven that the premises are:\n   - If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal (P \u2192 Q)\n   - The doll was plastic (P)\n\nThe conclusion that follows is:\n   - The truck was metal (Q)\n\nSince the argument follows the modus ponens structure, it is a logically valid argument. The conclusion necessarily follows from the premises, assuming the premises are true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
