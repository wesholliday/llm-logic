            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"The dog was inside\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The cat was outside.\"\n\n2. The second premise states that the antecedent of the conditional statement is true: \"The dog was inside.\" This is \\( P \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn from these premises is \"The cat was outside,\" which is \\( Q \\).\n\nThe argument structure here is modus ponens, a common and valid form of argument in logic. Modus ponens has the form:\n- If \\( P \\) then \\( Q \\) (premise)\n- \\( P \\) (premise)\n- Therefore, \\( Q \\) (conclusion)\n\nGiven that the premises are \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" and \"The dog was inside,\" and the conclusion is \"The cat was outside,\" the argument follows the modus ponens structure. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises if the premises are true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
