            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Tom watched football\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n2. The second premise states that \"Tom watched football,\" which is \\( P \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn from these premises is \"Jen watched basketball,\" which is \\( Q \\).\n\nThe argument structure here is known as modus ponens, a common form of argument in logic. Modus ponens has the following form:\n- If \\( P \\) then \\( Q \\) (premise)\n- \\( P \\) (premise)\n- Therefore, \\( Q \\) (conclusion)\n\nGiven that the premises are true:\n- \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is true.\n- \"Tom watched football\" is true.\n\nAccording to modus ponens, if both premises are true, then the conclusion \"Jen watched basketball\" must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
