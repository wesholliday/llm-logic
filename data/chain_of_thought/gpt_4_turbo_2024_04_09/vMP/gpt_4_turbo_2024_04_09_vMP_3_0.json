            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the book was written by James\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. The second premise is a statement affirming the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the first premise: \"The book was written by James.\" This is \\( P \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is \"The book is a mystery novel,\" which is \\( Q \\).\n\nThe argument structure here is modus ponens, a common form of valid argument in logic. Modus ponens has the form:\n   - If \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If P then Q)\n   - \\( P \\) (P is true)\n   - Therefore, \\( Q \\) (Therefore, Q is true)\n\nSince the argument follows this structure, where the conclusion \\( Q \\) necessarily follows from the premises \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( P \\), the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
