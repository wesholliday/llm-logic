Therefore, Chris finished the race. (Conclusion)\n\nThis argument is an example of modus ponens, a common form of valid argument in logic. Modus ponens has the structure:\n- If P, then Q.\n- P.\n- Therefore, Q.\n\nIn this case:\n- P corresponds to \"Alex finished the race.\"\n- Q corresponds to \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\nSince the premises logically lead to the conclusion following the structure of modus ponens, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
