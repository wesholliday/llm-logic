            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This can be symbolically represented as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"The griffin was in the forest\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\n2. The second premise states that the griffin was indeed in the forest, which is \\( P \\).\n\n3. The conclusion drawn is that the unicorn was in the forest, which is \\( Q \\).\n\nThe argument structure here is a classic example of modus ponens, a common form of valid argument in logic. Modus ponens has the form:\n- If \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If P then Q)\n- \\( P \\) (P is true)\n- Therefore, \\( Q \\) (Therefore, Q is true)\n\nGiven that the premises are that \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( P \\) are both asserted, and the conclusion is \\( Q \\), this argument follows the modus ponens form exactly.\n\nSince modus ponens is a valid argument form, the conclusion \\( Q \\) necessarily follows from the premises. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
