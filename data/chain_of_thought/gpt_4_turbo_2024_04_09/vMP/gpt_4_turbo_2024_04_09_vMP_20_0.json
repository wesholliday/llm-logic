(Affirmation of the antecedent)\n3. Therefore, Q. (Conclusion follows logically)\n\nIn this specific case:\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. (If P, then Q)\n2. The apple was red. (P)\n3. Therefore, the banana was yellow. (Q)\n\nSince the argument adheres to the structure of modus ponens, and modus ponens is a valid form of argument in classical logic, the conclusion (the banana was yellow) logically follows from the premises. Therefore, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
