(Affirmation of the antecedent)\n3. Therefore, the wolf was in the den. (Conclusion)\n\nThis argument is an example of modus ponens, a common form of valid logical reasoning. Modus ponens has the structure:\n- If P, then Q.\n- P.\n- Therefore, Q.\n\nIn this case:\n- P corresponds to \"The bear was in the cave.\"\n- Q corresponds to \"The wolf was in the den.\"\n\nSince the structure of the argument matches that of modus ponens, and modus ponens is a valid form of reasoning, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
