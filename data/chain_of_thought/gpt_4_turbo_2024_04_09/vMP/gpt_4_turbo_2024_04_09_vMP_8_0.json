(Affirmation of the antecedent)\n3. Therefore, the mummy was awake. (Conclusion)\n\nThis argument is an example of modus ponens, a common form of valid argument in logic. Modus ponens has the structure:\n- If P, then Q.\n- P.\n- Therefore, Q.\n\nIn this case:\n- P corresponds to \"the vampire was awake.\"\n- Q corresponds to \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\nSince the structure of the argument matches that of modus ponens, and modus ponens is a valid form of argument, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
