However, from the second statement, we know \\( \\neg R \\) is true (the robot did not visit Jupiter).\n\nUsing the rule of contraposition, \\( A \\rightarrow R \\) can be rewritten as \\( \\neg R \\rightarrow \\neg A \\). This means if \\( R \\) is not true (\\( \\neg R \\)), then \\( A \\) is not true (\\( \\neg A \\)).\n\nGiven \\( \\neg R \\) is true, by \\( \\neg R \\rightarrow \\neg A \\), we can conclude \\( \\neg A \\) is also true.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
