(Where M = Mary was at the wedding, S = Sue must have been at the wedding).\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This can be represented as: Not S.\n\nFrom these statements, we can use the rules of logic to infer a conclusion. Specifically, we use the rule of modus tollens, which states that if \"If P then Q\" is true and \"Not Q\" is true, then \"Not P\" must also be true.\n\nApplying modus tollens:\n- If M then S (given)\n- Not S (given)\n- Therefore, Not M (conclusion)\n\nThus, from the statements provided, we can logically infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
