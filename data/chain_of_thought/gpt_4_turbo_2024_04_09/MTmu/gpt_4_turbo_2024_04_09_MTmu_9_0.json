            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the statements given:\n\n1. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\n   This statement can be represented as: If L (Lisa bought the red shirt), then M (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\n   This statement negates the necessity of Mark buying the blue shirt, which can be represented as: Not M.\n\nGiven these representations:\n- If L then M (Statement 1)\n- Not M (Statement 2)\n\nFrom the structure of the first statement (If L then M), we know that if L is true, M must also be true. However, from the second statement, we know that M is not true (Not M).\n\nUsing the rule of contraposition, which states that \"If L then M\" is logically equivalent to \"If not M then not L\", we can infer from Not M that Not L must also be true.\n\nTherefore, since it is established that Not M (Mark did not buy the blue shirt), and the contrapositive states If not M then not L, it follows that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
