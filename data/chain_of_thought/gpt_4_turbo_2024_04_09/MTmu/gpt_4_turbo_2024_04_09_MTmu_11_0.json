            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use logical reasoning. Let's define the statements:\n\n1. Let P be \"The cake was chocolate.\"\n2. Let Q be \"The muffins must have been blueberry.\"\n\nThe first statement given is \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This can be written as:\n\\[ P \\implies Q \\]\n\nThe second statement is \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This can be written as:\n\\[ \\neg Q \\]\n\nWe need to determine if these statements together imply that \"The cake was not chocolate,\" which can be written as:\n\\[ \\neg P \\]\n\nFrom the implication \\( P \\implies Q \\), we know that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must also be true. However, we are given \\( \\neg Q \\) (the muffins were not blueberry). According to the rules of logic, if \\( P \\implies Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) is true, then \\( P \\) must be false to maintain logical consistency. This is because the truth of \\( P \\) would necessitate the truth of \\( Q \\), but \\( Q \\) is false.\n\nTherefore, from \\( P \\implies Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can conclude \\( \\neg P \\) (the cake was not chocolate).\n\nAnswer: yes",
