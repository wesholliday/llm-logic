            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the given statements.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\( R \\rightarrow B \\)\n   where \\( R \\) represents \"the car was red\" and \\( B \\) represents \"the truck must have been blue.\"\n\n2. The second statement is a negation: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\( \\neg B \\)\n\n3. We need to determine whether these statements together imply that the car was not red (\\( \\neg R \\)).\n\n4. Using the rules of logic, particularly modus tollens, we can analyze the implications. Modus tollens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) are true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\n5. Applying modus tollens to our scenario:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( R \\rightarrow B \\) (If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue).\n   - \\( \\neg Q \\) is \\( \\neg B \\) (It's not the case that the truck must have been blue).\n   - Therefore, \\( \\neg P \\) must be true, which is \\( \\neg R \\) (The car was not red).\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
