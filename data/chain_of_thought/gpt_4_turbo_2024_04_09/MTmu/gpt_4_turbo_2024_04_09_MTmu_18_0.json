            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given and apply the rules of logical inference.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" In logical form, this can be written as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"The doll was plastic\" and \\( M \\) represents \"The truck must have been metal.\"\n\n2. The second statement is a negation: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( \\neg M \\)\n\n3. We need to determine whether these statements allow us to infer that \"The doll was not plastic,\" which can be written as:\n   \\( \\neg P \\)\n\n4. Using the rules of logical inference, particularly Modus Tollens, we can analyze the statements. Modus Tollens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\) are both true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\n5. Applying Modus Tollens:\n   - From \\( P \\rightarrow M \\), we know that if \\( P \\) (the doll was plastic) is true, then \\( M \\) (the truck must have been metal) must also be true.\n   - However, we know \\( \\neg M \\) (the truck was not metal) is true.\n   - Therefore, \\( P \\) (the doll was plastic) must be false, which means \\( \\neg P \\) (the doll was not plastic) is true.\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
