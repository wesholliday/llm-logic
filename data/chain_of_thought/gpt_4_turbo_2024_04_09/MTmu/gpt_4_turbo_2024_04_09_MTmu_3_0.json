            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given and determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" In logical form, this can be represented as:\n   \\( J \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( J \\) represents \"the book was written by James\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the book must be a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. The second statement is a negation of the consequent of the first statement: \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\( \\neg M \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if these two statements together imply that the book was not written by James (\\( \\neg J \\)).\n\n4. Using the logical rule of Modus Tollens, which states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) are true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true, we can apply it here:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( J \\rightarrow M \\)\n   - \\( \\neg Q \\) is \\( \\neg M \\)\n   - Therefore, \\( \\neg P \\) which is \\( \\neg J \\), must be true.\n\n5. Thus, from \\( J \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\), we can infer \\( \\neg J \\). This means that if the book is not a mystery novel, then it was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
