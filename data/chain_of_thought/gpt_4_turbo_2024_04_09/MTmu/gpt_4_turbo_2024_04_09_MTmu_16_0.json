            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use logical reasoning. Let's denote the following statements:\n- Let P be the statement \"The shirt was cotton.\"\n- Let Q be the statement \"The pants must have been denim.\"\n\nFrom the problem, we have the following premises:\n1. If P then Q (If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim).\n2. Not Q (It's not the case that the pants must have been denim).\n\nWe need to determine whether these premises allow us to infer Not P (The shirt was not cotton).\n\nUsing the structure of logical implication, \"If P then Q\" can be interpreted as \"P implies Q.\" According to the rules of logic, if \"P implies Q\" is true and Q is false (Not Q), then P must also be false (Not P). This is because if P were true, then Q would necessarily be true as well, due to the implication. However, since Q is false, P must also be false to maintain the truth of the implication.\n\nThus, from the premises given:\n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\n2. It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\n\nWe can logically conclude:\nThe shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
