            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use logical reasoning:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\" In logical form, this can be written as: \n   \\( J \\rightarrow A \\)\n   where \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) represents \"Amy must have played tennis.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( \\neg A \\)\n   where \\( \\neg A \\) represents the negation of \\( A \\).\n\n3. We need to determine whether these statements allow us to infer that Jeff did not play basketball (\\( \\neg J \\)).\n\n4. Using the rules of logic, particularly modus tollens, we can analyze the statements. Modus tollens is a rule that says if \\( p \\rightarrow q \\) is true and \\( \\neg q \\) is true, then \\( \\neg p \\) must also be true.\n\n5. Applying modus tollens to our statements:\n   - \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis)\n   - \\( \\neg A \\) (It is not the case that Amy played tennis)\n   - Therefore, \\( \\neg J \\) (Jeff did not play basketball) must be true.\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
