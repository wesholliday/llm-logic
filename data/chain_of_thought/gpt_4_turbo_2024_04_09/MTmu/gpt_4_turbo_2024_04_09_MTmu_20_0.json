            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given and their implications.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This can be represented as: If A (the apple was red), then B (the banana must have been yellow).\n\n2. The second statement is a negation: \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\" This can be represented as: Not B.\n\n3. We need to determine if these statements together allow us to infer that \"The apple was not red\" (Not A).\n\n4. Using the rules of logic, particularly modus tollens, we can analyze the statements. Modus tollens is a rule that says if \"If A then B\" is true and \"Not B\" is true, then \"Not A\" must also be true.\n\n5. Applying modus tollens to our case:\n   - If A then B (If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow)\n   - Not B (It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow)\n   - Therefore, Not A (The apple was not red)\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can logically infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
