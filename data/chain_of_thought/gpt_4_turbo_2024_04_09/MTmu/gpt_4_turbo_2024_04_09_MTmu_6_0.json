            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the statements given:\n\n1. \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\" This can be represented as: If P (Sue chose pizza), then Q (Bob chose pasta).\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\" This can be represented as: Not Q (Bob did not choose pasta).\n\nFrom these statements, we can use the logical rule of contraposition. The contrapositive of the first statement \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P.\" This means that if Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nGiven that the second statement confirms Not Q (Bob did not choose pasta), the contrapositive \"If not Q then not P\" applies, leading us to conclude Not P (Sue did not choose pizza).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and using logical deduction, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
