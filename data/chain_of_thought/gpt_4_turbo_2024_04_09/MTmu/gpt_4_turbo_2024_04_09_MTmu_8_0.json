            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the statements given:\n\n1. \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\"\n   This can be represented as: V \u2192 M (where V is \"vampire was awake\" and M is \"mummy was awake\").\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\"\n   This can be represented as: \u00acM (where \u00acM is \"mummy was not awake\").\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use the rules of logic to infer the state of the vampire.\n\nFrom statement 1 (V \u2192 M), we know that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. However, statement 2 tells us that the mummy was not awake (\u00acM).\n\nUsing the rule of contraposition, which states that p \u2192 q is logically equivalent to \u00acq \u2192 \u00acp, we can rewrite statement 1 as:\n\u00acM \u2192 \u00acV\n\nGiven that statement 2 confirms \u00acM (mummy was not awake), we can use the contrapositive (\u00acM \u2192 \u00acV) to conclude that \u00acV (vampire was not awake) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and logical deduction, we can infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
