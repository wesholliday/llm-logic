            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given and apply the rules of logical inference.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\" In logical form, this can be represented as:\n   \\( B \\rightarrow W \\)\n   where \\( B \\) represents \"The bear was in the cave\" and \\( W \\) represents \"The wolf must have been in the den.\"\n\n2. The second statement is a negation: \"It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\( \\neg W \\)\n\n3. We need to determine whether these premises allow us to infer that the bear was not in the cave (\\( \\neg B \\)).\n\n4. Using the rule of Modus Tollens in logic, which states that if \\( p \\rightarrow q \\) and \\( \\neg q \\) are both true, then \\( \\neg p \\) must also be true, we can apply it to our statements:\n   - From \\( B \\rightarrow W \\), and knowing \\( \\neg W \\) (the wolf was not in the den),\n   - We can infer \\( \\neg B \\) (the bear was not in the cave).\n\nThus, based on the logical analysis using Modus Tollens, we can conclude that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes",
