            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the given statements.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"Tom watched football\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\" This negates \\( Q \\), so we have:\n   \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. We need to determine whether these statements imply that Tom did not watch football (\\( \\neg P \\)).\n\n4. Using the rules of logic, particularly modus tollens, we know that:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) imply \\( \\neg P \\).\n   This is because if the implication \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, and \\( Q \\) is false (\\( \\neg Q \\)), then \\( P \\) must also be false (\\( \\neg P \\)) to maintain the truth of the implication.\n\n5. Therefore, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can infer \\( \\neg P \\), which means \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
