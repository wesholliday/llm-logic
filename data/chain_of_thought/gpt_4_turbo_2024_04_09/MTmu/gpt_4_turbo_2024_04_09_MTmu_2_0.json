            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the statements given:\n\n1. \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\"\n   This statement can be represented as: If G (griffin was in the forest), then U (unicorn must have been in the forest).\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\"\n   This statement negates U, so we have \u00acU (it is not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest).\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use the logical rule of modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if we have an implication (If P then Q) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ), then we can infer the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP). Applying this to our statements:\n\n- If G then U (If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest)\n- \u00acU (It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest)\n\nFrom these, we can infer \u00acG (The griffin was not in the forest).\n\nAnswer: yes",
