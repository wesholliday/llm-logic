This rule states that if we have \\( S \\lor P \\) (either \\( S \\) or \\( P \\) is true), and we know \\( \\neg P \\) (it is not the case that \\( P \\) is true), then \\( S \\) must be true. This is because the truth of the disjunction \\( S \\lor P \\) must be upheld, and with \\( P \\) being false, the only remaining possibility for the disjunction to hold true is for \\( S \\) to be true.\n\nTherefore, from the statements provided, we can logically infer that \"The grommet is sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
