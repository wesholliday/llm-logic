This rule states that if we have \\( F \\lor S \\) (either \\( F \\) or \\( S \\) is true) and we know \\( \\neg S \\) (it is not the case that \\( S \\) is true), then \\( F \\) must be true. This is because the truth of the disjunction \\( F \\lor S \\) must be upheld, and with \\( S \\) being false, the only way for the disjunction to hold true is if \\( F \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, from the statements given, we can infer that \"The clug is fleeked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
