It asserts that at least one of the following must be true:\n- The smonk is vreebled.\n- The smonk must be plagged.\n\nThe second statement is a negation. It asserts that:\n- It is not true that the smonk must be plagged.\n\nGiven that the second statement negates the possibility that the smonk must be plagged, the only remaining possibility from the disjunction in the first statement is that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nTherefore, from these premises, we can infer that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
