It asserts that at least one of the following conditions must be true:\n- The glip is slogged.\n- The glip must be tragged.\n\nThe second statement is a negation. It asserts that:\n- It is not true that the glip must be tragged.\n\nGiven that the second statement negates the possibility that \"the glip must be tragged,\" the only remaining possibility from the first statement's disjunction is that \"the glip is slogged.\"\n\nTherefore, from these premises, we can infer that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
