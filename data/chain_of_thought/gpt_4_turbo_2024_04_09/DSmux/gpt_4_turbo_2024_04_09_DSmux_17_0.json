It asserts that at least one of the following conditions must be true:\n- The flob is skizzled.\n- The flob must be movated.\n\nThe second statement is a negation. It asserts that:\n- It is not true that the flob must be movated.\n\nGiven that the second statement negates the possibility that \"the flob must be movated,\" we are left with only one option from the disjunction in the first statement. Since it cannot be true that \"the flob must be movated,\" the only remaining possibility that satisfies the first statement is:\n- The flob is skizzled.\n\nTherefore, from these premises, we can infer that \"The flob is skizzled\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
