It asserts that at least one of the following must be true:\n- The fribble is snurgled.\n- The fribble must be crinked.\n\nThe second statement is a negation. It asserts that:\n- It is not true that the fribble must be crinked.\n\nGiven that the second statement negates the possibility that \"the fribble must be crinked,\" we are left with only one option from the disjunction in the first statement. Since it cannot be true that \"the fribble must be crinked,\" the only remaining possibility under the disjunction is that \"the fribble is snurgled.\"\n\nTherefore, from these premises, we can infer that the fribble is indeed snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
