It can be symbolically represented as:\nP \u2228 Q\nwhere P represents \"the shank is plooked\" and Q represents \"the shank must be nugged.\"\n\nThe second statement is a negation. It can be symbolically represented as:\n\u00acQ\nwhere \u00acQ represents \"It is not the case that the shank must be nugged.\"\n\nFrom these representations, we can apply the rule of disjunction elimination in logic. This rule states that if we have P \u2228 Q (either P is true, or Q is true, or both), and we know \u00acQ (Q is not true), then P must be true.\n\nThus, from P \u2228 Q and \u00acQ, we can infer P.\n\nApplying this to the problem:\n- P \u2228 Q is \"Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged.\"\n- \u00acQ is \"It's not the case that the shank must be nugged.\"\n\nSince we know \u00acQ is true, we can infer P, which is \"The shank is plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
