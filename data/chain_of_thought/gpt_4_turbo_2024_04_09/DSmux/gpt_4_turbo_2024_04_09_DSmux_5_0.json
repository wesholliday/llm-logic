Since the second statement negates the possibility that the zinger must be smoogled, and the first statement tells us that either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled, the negation of the second part (zinger must be smoogled) forces the truth of the first part (zinger is fraggled).\n\nStep 4: Conclusion. Given that the only remaining possibility from the disjunction is that the zinger is fraggled, we can infer that the zinger is indeed fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
