It can be symbolically represented as:\n\\[ S \\lor T \\]\nwhere \\( S \\) represents \"the whiffle is shanked\" and \\( T \\) represents \"the whiffle must be tinked.\"\n\nThe second statement is a negation. It can be symbolically represented as:\n\\[ \\neg T \\]\nwhere \\( \\neg T \\) means \"it is not the case that the whiffle must be tinked.\"\n\nGiven these representations, we can use logical deduction to analyze the implications:\n\n- From \\( S \\lor T \\) (either \\( S \\) or \\( T \\)), and knowing \\( \\neg T \\) (not \\( T \\)), we apply the rule of disjunctive syllogism. Disjunctive syllogism states that if one of the disjuncts in a disjunction is false, then the other must be true. Since \\( T \\) is false (\\( \\neg T \\)), \\( S \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical analysis, we can infer that \"the whiffle is shanked\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
