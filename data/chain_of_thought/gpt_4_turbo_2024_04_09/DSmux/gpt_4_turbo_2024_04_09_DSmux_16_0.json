It asserts that at least one of the following must be true:\n- The sneg is crampled.\n- The sneg must be sproted.\n\nThe second statement is a negation. It asserts that:\n- It is not true that the sneg must be sproted.\n\nGiven that the second statement negates the possibility that \"the sneg must be sproted,\" and since the first statement tells us that if it's not \"the sneg must be sproted,\" then \"the sneg is crampled\" must be true, we can infer that:\n\nThe sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
