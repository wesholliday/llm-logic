This rule states that if \\( P \\lor Q \\) is true and \\( \\neg Q \\) is true, then \\( P \\) must be true. This is because the truth of \\( P \\lor Q \\) requires that at least one of \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\) is true. Since \\( \\neg Q \\) indicates that \\( Q \\) is false, the only remaining possibility for \\( P \\lor Q \\) to hold true is for \\( P \\) to be true.\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can logically infer that \"the sprocket is cranked\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
