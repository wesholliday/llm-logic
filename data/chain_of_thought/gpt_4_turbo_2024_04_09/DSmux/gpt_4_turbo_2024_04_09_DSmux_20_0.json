This rule states that if \\( P \\lor Q \\) is true and \\( \\neg Q \\) is also true, then \\( P \\) must be true. This is because the truth of \\( P \\lor Q \\) requires that at least one of \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\) is true. Since \\( \\neg Q \\) asserts that \\( Q \\) is false, the only remaining possibility for \\( P \\lor Q \\) to hold true is for \\( P \\) (the fleeg is bluttered) to be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical analysis of the statements provided, we can infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered\" is indeed true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
