It states that one of the following two conditions must be true:\n- The flug is blummed.\n- The flug must be zimmed.\n\nThe second statement is a negation. It negates the second part of the disjunction:\n- It is not true that the flug must be zimmed.\n\nGiven that the second part of the disjunction (the flug must be zimmed) is negated by the second statement, the only remaining possibility for the first statement to hold true is for the first part of the disjunction to be true. Therefore, the flug must be blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
