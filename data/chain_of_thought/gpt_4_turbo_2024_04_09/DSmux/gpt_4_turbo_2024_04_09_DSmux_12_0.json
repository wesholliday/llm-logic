This rule states that if we have \\( S \\lor L \\) (either \\( S \\) or \\( L \\) is true) and we know \\( \\neg L \\) (it is not the case that \\( L \\) is true), then \\( S \\) must be true. This is because the truth of the disjunction \\( S \\lor L \\) must be upheld, and with \\( L \\) being false, the only way for the disjunction to be true is if \\( S \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The smip is shripped.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
