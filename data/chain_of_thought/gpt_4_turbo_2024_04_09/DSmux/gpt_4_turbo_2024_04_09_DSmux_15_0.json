It asserts that at least one of the following must be true:\n- The dreb is vroombed.\n- The dreb must be spened.\n\nThe second statement is a negation. It asserts that:\n- It is not true that the dreb must be spened.\n\nGiven that the second statement negates the possibility that \"the dreb must be spened,\" the only remaining possibility from the disjunction is that \"the dreb is vroombed.\"\n\nTherefore, based on these premises, we can infer that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
