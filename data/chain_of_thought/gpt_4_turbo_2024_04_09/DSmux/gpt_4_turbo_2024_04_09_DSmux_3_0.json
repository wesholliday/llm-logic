            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given:\n\n1. \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.\"\n2. \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked.\"\n\nThe first statement is a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario). It can be represented as:\n\\[ P \\lor Q \\]\nwhere \\( P \\) represents \"the splat is morphed\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"the splat must be quanked.\"\n\nThe second statement is a negation, specifically negating \\( Q \\). It can be represented as:\n\\[ \\neg Q \\]\n\nGiven these representations, we can apply the logical rule of disjunction elimination. This rule states that if \\( P \\lor Q \\) is true and \\( \\neg Q \\) is also true, then \\( P \\) must be true. This is because the truth of the disjunction \\( P \\lor Q \\) requires that at least one of \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\) is true. Since \\( \\neg Q \\) (i.e., \\( Q \\) is false), the only remaining possibility for the disjunction to hold is for \\( P \\) to be true.\n\nThus, from the statements provided, we can logically infer that \"the splat is morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
