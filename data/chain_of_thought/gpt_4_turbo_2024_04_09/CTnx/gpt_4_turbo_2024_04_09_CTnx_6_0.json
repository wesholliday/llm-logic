            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"the grommet was sploffed\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"the grommet plopped the frink\".\n\n2. We need to determine if the following statement is logically equivalent or can be inferred: \"If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\n3. To see if \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), we analyze the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. Since the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) and because a statement is always logically equivalent to its contrapositive, we can conclude that \"If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed\" can indeed be inferred from \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
