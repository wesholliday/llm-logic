            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was not spened.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( V \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n   - Where \\( V \\) represents \"the dreb was vroombed\" and \\( S \\) represents \"the dreb was spened\".\n   - The statement \\( V \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) means that if \\( V \\) is true (the dreb was vroombed), then \\( S \\) must be false (the dreb was not spened).\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\"\n   - This can be written as: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg V \\)\n\n3. To infer \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg V \\) from \\( V \\rightarrow \\neg S \\), we need to understand the relationship between these statements:\n   - \\( V \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) states that the occurrence of \\( V \\) (vroombing) prevents \\( S \\) (spening).\n   - \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg V \\) states that the occurrence of \\( S \\) (spening) prevents \\( V \\) (vroombing).\n\n4. The logical equivalence to check is whether \\( V \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) implies \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg V \\):\n   - The contrapositive of \\( V \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg V \\). In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent.\n   - Therefore, if \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was not spened\" is true, then \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
