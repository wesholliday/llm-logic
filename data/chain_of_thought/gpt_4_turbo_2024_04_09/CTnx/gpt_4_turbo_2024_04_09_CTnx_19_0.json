The original statement is a conditional statement:\n\n1. \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk did not plagged.\"\n\nThis can be written in logical form as:\n\\[ P \\implies \\neg Q \\]\nwhere \\( P \\) represents \"the smonk was vreebled\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"the smonk plagged\".\n\nWe need to determine if this implies the converse:\n\\[ Q \\implies \\neg P \\]\n\nFrom the original statement \\( P \\implies \\neg Q \\), we know that if \\( P \\) is true (the smonk was vreebled), then \\( Q \\) must be false (the smonk did not plagged). \n\nNow, let's consider the statement we need to infer:\n\"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled.\"\nThis is logically written as \\( Q \\implies \\neg P \\).\n\nGiven \\( P \\implies \\neg Q \\), if \\( Q \\) were true (the smonk plagged), then \\( P \\) must be false (the smonk was not vreebled) because the truth of \\( Q \\) (the smonk plagged) contradicts the outcome \\( \\neg Q \\) (the smonk did not plagged) required if \\( P \\) were true. Thus, \\( Q \\) being true forces \\( P \\) to be false, which is exactly what \\( Q \\implies \\neg P \\) states.\n\nTherefore, from \\( P \\implies \\neg Q \\), we can indeed infer \\( Q \\implies \\neg P \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
