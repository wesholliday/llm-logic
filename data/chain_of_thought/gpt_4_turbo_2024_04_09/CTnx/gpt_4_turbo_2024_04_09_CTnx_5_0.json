            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled.\" This can be written in logical form as: \n   \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"the zinger was fraggled\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"the zinger was smoogled\".\n\n2. We need to determine if the following statement is true based on the original: \"If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\n3. To infer \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), we need to establish if these statements are logically equivalent or if one implies the other.\n\n4. The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is true, then \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\n5. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent and retains the truth value of the original statement, we can conclude that if \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled\" is true, then \"If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
