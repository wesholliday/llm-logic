The original statement is: \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle did not tink.\" In logical terms, this can be written as: If P, then not Q.\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the whiffle tink, then the whiffle was not shanked.\" This can be written as: If Q, then not P.\n\n3. Using the rules of logic, specifically the contrapositive, we know that the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then not Q\" is \"If Q, then not P.\"\n\n4. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, the statement \"If the whiffle tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\" is a valid inference from \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle did not tink.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
