            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given. The original statement is a conditional statement:\n\n\"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg did not sproted the frink.\"\n\nThis can be written in logical form as:\nP \u2192 \u00acQ\nwhere P represents \"the sneg was crampled\" and Q represents \"the sneg sproted the frink\".\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement, which is:\nQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement (P \u2192 \u00acQ) is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion of the original statement and swapping them. Thus, the contrapositive of \"If P then \u00acQ\" is \"If Q then \u00acP\".\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg did not sproted the frink\", we can indeed infer \"If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
