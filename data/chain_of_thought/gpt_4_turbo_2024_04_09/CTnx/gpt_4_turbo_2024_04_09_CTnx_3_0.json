            "content": "To solve this, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat did not quank.\" In logical terms, this can be written as: If M (the splat was morphed), then not Q (the splat did not quank).\n\n2. We need to determine if the following statement is logically inferred: \"If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed.\" In logical terms, this is: If Q, then not M.\n\n3. The original statement (If M, then not Q) is a conditional statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement (If M, then not Q) is (If Q, then not M), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\n4. Therefore, from the statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat did not quank,\" we can indeed infer that \"If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
