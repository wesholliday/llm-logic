            "content": "To solve this, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"the sprocket was cranked\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"the sprocket was daggled\".\n\n2. The statement we need to infer is: \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\n3. To determine if \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), we need to understand the relationship between these two forms. The form \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) asserts that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be false. Conversely, if \\( Q \\) is true (the sprocket was daggled), then \\( P \\) must be false (the sprocket was not cranked) to maintain the truth of the original statement.\n\n4. This relationship is a contrapositive in logic, where the contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) and both statements are logically equivalent. Therefore, if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is true, then \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
