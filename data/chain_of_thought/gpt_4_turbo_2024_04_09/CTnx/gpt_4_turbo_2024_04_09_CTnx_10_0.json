            "content": "To solve this, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was not garpled.\" In logical terms, this can be written as: If S (sproinged), then not G (not garpled). Symbolically, this is S \u2192 \u00acG.\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the wug was garpled, then it was not sproinged.\" This can be written as: If G (garpled), then not S (not sproinged). Symbolically, this is G \u2192 \u00acS.\n\n3. To see if we can infer G \u2192 \u00acS from S \u2192 \u00acG, we need to understand the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement has the same truth value as the original statement. The contrapositive of S \u2192 \u00acG is \u00ac(\u00acG) \u2192 \u00acS, which simplifies to G \u2192 \u00acS.\n\n4. Since the contrapositive of the original statement (S \u2192 \u00acG) is exactly G \u2192 \u00acS, and because a statement and its contrapositive always have the same truth value, we can indeed infer \"If the wug was garpled, then it was not sproinged\" from \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was not garpled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
