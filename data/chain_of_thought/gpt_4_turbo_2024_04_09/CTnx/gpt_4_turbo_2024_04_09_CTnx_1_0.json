            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given and determine if the inference holds.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"the flugel was blimmed\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"the flugel was zargled\".\n\n2. The statement we need to infer is: \"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\n3. To determine if \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), we need to understand the relationship between \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) based on the original statement.\n\n4. The original statement \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) asserts that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be false. However, it does not directly state what happens if \\( Q \\) is true. \n\n5. The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is true, then \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\n6. Since the contrapositive is always true if the original statement is true, we can conclude that from \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled,\" we can indeed infer \"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
