            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship given in the statement and its contrapositive.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was not tragged.\" In logical terms, this can be written as:\n\\[ P \\implies \\neg Q \\]\nwhere \\( P \\) is \"the glip was slogged\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the glip was tragged\".\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\implies \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\implies \\neg P \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nThus, the contrapositive of our original statement \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was not tragged\" is \"If the glip was tragged, then the glip was not slogged.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the statement \"If the glip was tragged, then the glip was not slogged\" is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
