The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it did not surn.\"\n\nIn logical terms, this can be written as:\nIf P, then not Q. (Where P = the fleeg was bluttered, Q = the fleeg surned)\n\nWe need to determine if this implies the converse of its contrapositive:\nThe contrapositive of \"If P, then not Q\" is \"If Q, then not P.\" This is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the contrapositive would be: \"If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n\nSince the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, the answer to whether we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
