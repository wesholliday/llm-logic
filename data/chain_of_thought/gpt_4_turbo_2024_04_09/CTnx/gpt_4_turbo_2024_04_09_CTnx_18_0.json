            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the given statement and its potential inference.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was not nugged.\" In logical terms, this can be written as: \n   \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg N \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"the shank was plooked\" and \\( N \\) represents \"the shank was nugged\".\n\n2. The statement we need to infer is: \"If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( N \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\n3. To determine if \\( N \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg N \\), we need to understand the relationship between \\( P \\) and \\( N \\) based on the original statement.\n\n4. The original statement \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg N \\) asserts that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( N \\) must be false. However, it does not explicitly state what happens if \\( N \\) is true.\n\n5. The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg N \\) is \\( N \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg N \\) is true, then \\( N \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\n6. Since the contrapositive is always true if the original statement is true, we can conclude that from \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was not nugged,\" we can indeed infer \"If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
