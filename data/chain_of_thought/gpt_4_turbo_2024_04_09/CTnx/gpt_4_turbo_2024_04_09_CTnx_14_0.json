The original statement is: \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug did not snugged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: If P, then not Q. (Where P is \"the clug was fleeked\" and Q is \"the clug snugged\")\n\n2. We need to determine if the following statement is logically inferred: \"If the clug snugged, then the clug was not fleeked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: If Q, then not P.\n\n3. To analyze this, we consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then not Q\" is \"If Q, then not P.\" The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. Since the contrapositive of the original statement \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug did not snugged\" is \"If the clug snugged, then the clug was not fleeked,\" and because a statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent:\n\nAnswer: yes",
