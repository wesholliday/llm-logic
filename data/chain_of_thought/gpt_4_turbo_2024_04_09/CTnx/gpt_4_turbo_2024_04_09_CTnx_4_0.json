            "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements given.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink.\" This can be written in logical form as: \n   \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"the fribble was snurgled\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"the fribble crink.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if the following statement is logically equivalent or can be inferred: \"If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\n3. To analyze this, we can use the concept of contraposition in logic. The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\n4. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, the statement \"If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\" is indeed a valid inference from \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
