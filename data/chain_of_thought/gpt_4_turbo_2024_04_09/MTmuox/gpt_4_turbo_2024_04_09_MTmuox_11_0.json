We can denote this as \u00ac\u25a1Z (it is not necessarily the case that Z).\n\n2. \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed\" can be represented as B \u2192 \u25a1Z (if B then necessarily Z).\n\nWe need to determine if these premises allow us to infer \"The flug was not blummed\" (\u00acB).\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that it is not necessarily true that Z (the flug was zimmed). This means Z could be false.\n\nFrom the second statement, if B (the flug was blummed) were true, then Z would necessarily be true (\u25a1Z). However, from the first statement, we know that \u25a1Z is false (it is not necessarily the case that Z).\n\nTherefore, if assuming B leads to a contradiction with the first statement (since B implies \u25a1Z, which we know is false), B must be false.\n\nThus, we can infer that \u00acB (the flug was not blummed).\n\nAnswer: yes",
