It could have, but it wasn't a requirement.\n\n2. \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated\" establishes a conditional relationship where the act of being skizzled necessitates that the flob movated.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer the following:\n- Since it is not the case that the flob must have movated, and if being skizzled would require that the flob must have movated, then the flob could not have been skizzled. If the flob were skizzled, it would contradict the first statement because being skizzled would make movating a necessity, which the first statement denies.\n\nThus, the conclusion that \"The flob was not skizzled\" logically follows from the premises provided.\n\nAnswer: yes",
