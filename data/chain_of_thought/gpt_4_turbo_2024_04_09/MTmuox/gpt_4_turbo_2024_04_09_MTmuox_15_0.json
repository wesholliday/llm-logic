According to the implication V \u2192 S (if the dreb was vroombed, then it must have been spened), if V were true (the dreb was vroombed), then S would also have to be true. However, we know S is false. Therefore, V must be false to maintain the truth of the implication V \u2192 S.\n\nThus, from \u00acS and V \u2192 S, we can infer \u00acV (the dreb was not vroombed).\n\nAnswer: yes",
