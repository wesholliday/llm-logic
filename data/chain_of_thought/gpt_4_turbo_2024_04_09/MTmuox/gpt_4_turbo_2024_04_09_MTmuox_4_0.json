            "content": "To solve this, let's break down the statements:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the fribble must have crinked\" implies that the fribble did not necessarily crink. This can be interpreted as the fribble possibly not crinking.\n\n2. \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked\" establishes a conditional relationship where the act of snurgling the fribble guarantees that it crinked.\n\nFrom these statements, if we assume the fribble was snurgled, then by statement 2, it must have crinked. However, statement 1 tells us that it's not the case that the fribble must have crinked, which contradicts the result of our assumption (that the fribble crinked as a necessary consequence of being snurgled). Therefore, the assumption that the fribble was snurgled leads to a contradiction.\n\nThus, the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
