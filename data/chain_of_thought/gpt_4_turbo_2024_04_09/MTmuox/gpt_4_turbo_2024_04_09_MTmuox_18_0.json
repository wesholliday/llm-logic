This means \"if the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\"\n\nGiven that \u00acN is true (from the first premise), we can directly apply the contrapositive (\u00acN \u2192 \u00acP) to conclude \u00acP.\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The shank was not plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
