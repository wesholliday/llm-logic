We can denote this as \u00ac\u25a1S (it is not necessarily the case that S, where S is \"the zinger was smoogled\").\n\n2. \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger must have been smoogled\" can be represented as F \u2192 \u25a1S (if F, then necessarily S, where F is \"the zinger was fraggled\").\n\nWe need to determine if these premises allow us to conclude \u00acF (the zinger was not fraggled).\n\nFrom the first premise, we have \u00ac\u25a1S, which means it is possible that the zinger was not smoogled (\u00acS is possible).\n\nFrom the second premise, F \u2192 \u25a1S, if the zinger was fraggled, then it must have been smoogled.\n\nIf we assume F (the zinger was fraggled), then by F \u2192 \u25a1S, it follows that \u25a1S (the zinger must have been smoogled). However, this contradicts the first premise \u00ac\u25a1S. Therefore, our assumption that F is true leads to a contradiction.\n\nSince assuming F leads to a contradiction with the established premises, F must be false.\n\nThus, we can conclude \u00acF (the zinger was not fraggled).\n\nAnswer: yes",
