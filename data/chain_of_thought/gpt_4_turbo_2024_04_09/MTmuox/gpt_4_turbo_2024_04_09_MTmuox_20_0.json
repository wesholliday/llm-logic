We can represent this as \u00acS (not Surned).\n\n2. \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned\" can be represented as B \u2192 S (if Bluttered, then Surned).\n\nGiven these representations, we need to determine if \u00acB (the fleeg was not bluttered) can be inferred from these statements.\n\nFrom the first statement, we have \u00acS. The second statement, B \u2192 S, tells us that if B were true, then S would also have to be true. However, we know from the first statement that S is not true (\u00acS). Therefore, B cannot be true either, because if B were true, it would contradict the truth of \u00acS given by the first statement.\n\nThus, since assuming B leads to a contradiction, B must be false. Therefore, the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
