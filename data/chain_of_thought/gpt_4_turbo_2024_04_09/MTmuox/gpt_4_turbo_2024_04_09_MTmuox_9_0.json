We can interpret this as \u00acV (not varnished).\n\n2. \"If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished\" can be written in logical form as P \u2192 V (if plinked, then varnished).\n\nWe need to determine if these statements together imply that \"The twonk was not plinked\" (\u00acP).\n\nFrom statement 1, we have \u00acV (the twonk might not have been varnished). From statement 2, P \u2192 V (if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished). \n\nUsing modus tollens, a form of logical argument which states that if P implies V, and V is not true, then P must also not be true. Here, since V (varnished) is not necessarily true (\u00acV), and if P (plinked) were true, then V would necessarily be true (from P \u2192 V), the fact that V is not necessarily true implies that P cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, from \u00acV and P \u2192 V, we can infer \u00acP (the twonk was not plinked).\n\nAnswer: yes",
