The second statement, C \u2192 D, tells us that if C is true, then D must also be true. However, we know D is false (\u00acD). Therefore, if C were true, it would contradict the truth of \u00acD because C being true implies D must be true, which it isn't.\n\nThus, C must be false to maintain the truth of \u00acD. This means \u00acC is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
