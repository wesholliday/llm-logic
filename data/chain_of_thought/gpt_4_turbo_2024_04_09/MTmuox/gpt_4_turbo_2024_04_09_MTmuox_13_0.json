However, we know that T is false (\u00acT). Therefore, S must also be false to maintain the truth of the implication (S \u2192 T). This is because if S were true, then T would also have to be true, which contradicts \u00acT.\n\nThus, from \u00acT and S \u2192 T, we can conclude \u00acS (the glip was not slogged).\n\nAnswer: yes",
