Here, we apply it as follows:\n\n- We know \u00ac\u25a1P (it is not necessarily true that P).\n- We have V \u2192 \u25a1P (if V then necessarily P).\n- From \u00ac\u25a1P, we infer \u00acV (not V), because if V were true, then \u25a1P would also have to be true, contradicting \u00ac\u25a1P.\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can infer that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
