However, we know from the first statement that Q is false (\u00acQ).\n\nGiven that M \u2192 Q (if M then Q) and knowing \u00acQ (not Q), it follows that M cannot be true because that would make Q true, contradicting \u00acQ. Therefore, M must be false.\n\nThus, from \u00acQ and M \u2192 Q, we can infer \u00acM (the splat was not morphed).\n\nAnswer: yes",
