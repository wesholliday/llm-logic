            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The event might be formal or semi-formal\" suggests that there are two possibilities for the nature of the event: it could be formal, or it could be semi-formal. The use of \"or\" in this context indicates a choice between two alternatives. When this statement is rephrased as \"The event might be formal or it might be semi-formal,\" it retains the same meaning: there is a possibility of the event being formal, and there is also a possibility of it being semi-formal. Both statements express uncertainty about which of the two styles the event will adhere to, but confirm that it will be one of these two. Therefore, the inference from the original statement to the rephrased statement does not alter the meaning or introduce any new information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
