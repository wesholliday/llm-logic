            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package might be delivered today or tomorrow\" suggests that there is a possibility of the package being delivered on either of the two days mentioned, but it does not specify that each day is independently a possibility. However, the logical interpretation of \"or\" in this context typically means that each part of the statement can stand alone as a possibility. Therefore, saying \"The package might be delivered today or it might be delivered tomorrow\" is essentially restating the original sentence with a slight emphasis on the independence of each day's possibility. This interpretation aligns with the general understanding of the word \"might,\" which indicates a possibility without certainty. Thus, the inference maintains the original meaning while clarifying that each day is a separate possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
