            "content": "Explanation: The original statement, \"The document might be signed or notarized,\" suggests that there are two possibilities for the state of the document: it could be signed, or it could be notarized. The use of \"or\" in this context indicates that at least one of the conditions (signed or notarized) could be true, but it does not exclude the possibility that both could be true simultaneously.\n\nWhen the statement is rephrased as \"The document might be signed or it might be notarized,\" it retains the same meaning. This version explicitly states each condition as a possibility, which is consistent with the meaning of the original statement. Both versions imply that there is uncertainty about the state of the document, and they acknowledge that either or both conditions might apply.\n\nTherefore, the rephrased statement does not change the inherent uncertainty or the conditions being considered; it merely clarifies that each is a possibility independently of the other.\n\nAnswer: yes",
