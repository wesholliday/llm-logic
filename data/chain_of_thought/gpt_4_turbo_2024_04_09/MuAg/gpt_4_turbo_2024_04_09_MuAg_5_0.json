            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is \"The package must have been delivered today and it must have been signed for.\" This statement contains two separate clauses connected by \"and,\" each beginning with \"must have been\": 1) \"must have been delivered today\" and 2) \"must have been signed for.\" This structure emphasizes that both conditions are necessary and definite.\n\nThe statement to infer is \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for.\" This inferred statement maintains the same two conditions but drops the repeated \"must have been\" before \"signed for.\" The simplification does not change the meaning or the certainty of the conditions. Both versions assert with certainty that the package was both delivered today and signed for. The inference retains the original meaning and necessity of both conditions happening, just with less repetition in the phrasing.\n\nTherefore, the inference is logically valid as it conveys the same information and certainty without altering the original intent or meaning of the statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
