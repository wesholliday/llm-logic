            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is \"The application must have been completed online and it must have included references.\" This statement contains two separate requirements for the application: 1) it must have been completed online, and 2) it must have included references. Each requirement is emphasized with the word \"must,\" indicating a necessity or obligation for both conditions.\n\nThe statement you are asking about, \"The application must have been completed online and included references,\" essentially conveys the same two requirements. The only difference is the removal of the second \"must,\" which simplifies the sentence but does not change the meaning. The necessity of the application being completed online and including references is still maintained. The use of \"must\" for the first requirement and the conjunction \"and\" sufficiently imply that both conditions are obligatory.\n\nTherefore, the inference from the original statement to the proposed statement does not alter the conditions or requirements regarding how the application was to be completed. Both statements assert that the application was completed online and included references as necessary conditions.\n\nAnswer: yes",
