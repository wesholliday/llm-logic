            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is \"The project must have been completed by Friday and it must have been under budget.\" This statement contains two separate clauses connected by \"and,\" each starting with \"must have been\": 1) must have been completed by Friday, and 2) must have been under budget.\n\nThe statement you are asking about, \"The project must have been completed by Friday and been under budget,\" essentially conveys the same information but omits the repeated \"must have been\" in the second clause. This is a common grammatical practice known as ellipsis, where words are omitted when they are understood from the context. In this case, \"must have been\" is understood to apply to both \"completed by Friday\" and \"been under budget\" without needing to be repeated.\n\nThus, the meaning of both statements is the same: both clauses are governed by \"must have been,\" indicating necessity regarding both the completion date and the budget status of the project.\n\nAnswer: yes",
