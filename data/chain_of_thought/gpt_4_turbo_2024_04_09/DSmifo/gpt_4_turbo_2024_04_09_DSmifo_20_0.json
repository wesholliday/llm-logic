It leaves open both possibilities: the sunglasses being on her head and not being on her head.\n\nThe second statement presents a clear dichotomy: the sunglasses are either on her head or in her bag. There are no other options given for the location of the sunglasses.\n\nGiven that the first statement allows for the possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head, and the second statement limits the location of the sunglasses to either being on her head or in her bag, if we accept the possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head as true, then by the second statement, the only remaining option is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nTherefore, if the sunglasses are indeed not on her head, they must be in her bag, as per the conditions set by the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
