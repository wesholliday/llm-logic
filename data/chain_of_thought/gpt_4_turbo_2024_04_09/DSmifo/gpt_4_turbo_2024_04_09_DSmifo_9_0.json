It leaves open the possibility that the puzzle piece could still be blending in on the floor.\n\nThe second statement presents a clear dichotomy: either the puzzle piece is blending in on the floor, or it is in the box. There are no other options given.\n\nSince the first statement does not confirm that the puzzle piece is definitely not blending in on the floor, we cannot rule out this possibility. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the puzzle piece must be in the box based solely on these statements. The possibility remains that the puzzle piece could still be blending in on the floor.\n\nAnswer: no",
