The second statement tells us that if the umbrella is not in the closet, the only other given option is that it is in the car.\n\nSince the first statement allows for the possibility that the umbrella is not in the closet, and the second statement provides only one alternative location (the car) if it is not in the closet, we can infer that the umbrella must be in the car if it is indeed not in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
