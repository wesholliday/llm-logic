The second statement then tells us that if the cat is not playing in the bedroom, the only other given option is that it is napping on the couch.\n\nHowever, since the first statement only suggests a possibility and does not confirm that the cat is definitely not in the bedroom, we cannot conclusively infer from these two statements alone that the cat must be napping on the couch. The cat could still potentially be playing in the bedroom.\n\nAnswer: no",
