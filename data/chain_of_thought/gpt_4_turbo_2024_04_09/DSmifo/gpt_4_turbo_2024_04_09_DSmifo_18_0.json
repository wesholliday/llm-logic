It leaves open the possibility that the notebook could still be on the nightstand.\n\nThe second statement presents a clear dichotomy: the notebook is either on the nightstand or in the drawer. There are no other options given for the location of the notebook.\n\nGiven that the first statement does not confirm the absence of the notebook from the nightstand, we cannot definitively conclude that it must be in the drawer. The possibility remains that the notebook could still be on the nightstand.\n\nTherefore, from the information provided, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The notebook is in the drawer\" based solely on these statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
