Here, P represents \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q represents \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nWe are also given that \"the muffins were not blueberry.\" This is the negation of Q, represented as not Q.\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens, if we have a conditional statement (If P then Q) and the negation of the consequent (not Q), we can conclude the negation of the antecedent (not P). \n\nApplying this to the given statements:\n- If the cake was chocolate (P), then the muffins were blueberry (Q).\n- The muffins were not blueberry (not Q).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude:\n- The cake was not chocolate (not P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
