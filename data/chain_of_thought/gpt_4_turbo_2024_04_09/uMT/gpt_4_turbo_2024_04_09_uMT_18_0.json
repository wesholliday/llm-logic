            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use logical reasoning, specifically the concept of contraposition in conditional statements.\n\nThe original statement given is: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" In logical terms, this can be expressed as:\n\\[ P \\implies M \\]\nwhere \\( P \\) represents \"the doll was plastic\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the truck was metal.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( P \\implies M \\) is \\( \\neg M \\implies \\neg P \\), which is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\"\n\nWe are also given that \"the truck was not metal,\" which can be represented as \\( \\neg M \\).\n\nSince \\( \\neg M \\) is true and \\( \\neg M \\implies \\neg P \\) (the contrapositive), we can conclude \\( \\neg P \\), which means \"the doll was not plastic.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
