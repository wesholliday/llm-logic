Here, P represents \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q represents \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n\nWe are also given that \"the wolf was not in the den.\" This means that Q is false.\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement (If P then Q) and we know that Q is false, we can conclude that P must also be false. This is because a true conditional statement cannot have a true hypothesis (P) and a false conclusion (Q). This form of reasoning is known as modus tollens.\n\nModus tollens states that if \"If P then Q\" is true and Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\nTherefore, since it is given that \"the wolf was not in the den\" (Q is false), we can conclude that \"the bear was not in the cave\" (P is false).\n\nAnswer: yes",
