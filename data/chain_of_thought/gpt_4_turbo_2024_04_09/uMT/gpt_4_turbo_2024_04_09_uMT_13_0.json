            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use logical reasoning, specifically the concept of contraposition in conditional statements.\n\nThe original statement given is: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" In logical terms, this can be expressed as:\n\\[ P \\implies Q \\]\nwhere \\( P \\) is \"the car was red\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( P \\implies Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\implies \\neg P \\), which is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that the statement \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\" must also be true.\n\nGiven that \"the truck was not blue\" is true (\\( \\neg Q \\)), the contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\implies \\neg P \\) allows us to conclude that \"the car was not red\" (\\( \\neg P \\)) is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the contrapositive of the original statement, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
