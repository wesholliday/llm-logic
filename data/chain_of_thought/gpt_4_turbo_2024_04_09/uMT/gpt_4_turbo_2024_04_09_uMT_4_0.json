The robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nFrom statement 1, we have a conditional statement: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n\\[ P \\implies Q \\]\nwhere \\( P \\) is \"the alien visited Mars\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the robot visited Jupiter.\"\n\nStatement 2 tells us that \\( Q \\) is false, i.e., \"the robot did not visit Jupiter.\"\n\nIn logic, if \\( P \\implies Q \\) and \\( Q \\) is false, then \\( P \\) must also be false to maintain the truth of the implication. This is because the only way an implication \\( P \\implies Q \\) can be false is if \\( P \\) is true and \\( Q \\) is false. Since we know \\( Q \\) is false, if \\( P \\) were true, it would make the implication false, which contradicts the given information that the implication is true.\n\nTherefore, since \\( Q \\) (the robot visited Jupiter) is false, \\( P \\) (the alien visited Mars) must also be false to keep the implication true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
