            "content": "The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" can be represented as a conditional statement: If P (Joe went to the park), then Q (Lucy went to the zoo). This is logically expressed as P \u2192 Q.\n\nWe are also given that Lucy did not go to the zoo, which is the negation of Q, \u00acQ.\n\nIn logic, if we have P \u2192 Q and we know \u00acQ (Lucy did not go to the zoo), we can infer \u00acP (Joe did not go to the park) through a rule called modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if P implies Q and Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\nTherefore, since we know Lucy did not go to the zoo (\u00acQ), and if Joe went to the park implies Lucy went to the zoo (P \u2192 Q), we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: yes",
