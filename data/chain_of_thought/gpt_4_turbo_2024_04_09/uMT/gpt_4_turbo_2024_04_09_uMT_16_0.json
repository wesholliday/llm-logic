            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use logical reasoning based on the given statements:\n\n1. \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\n2. \"The pants were not denim.\"\n\nFrom statement 1, we can express this as a conditional statement: If \\( S \\) (the shirt is cotton), then \\( P \\) (the pants are denim). Symbolically, this is \\( S \\implies P \\).\n\nStatement 2 tells us that \\( P \\) is false (the pants are not denim).\n\nUsing the rule of contraposition in logic, the contrapositive of \\( S \\implies P \\) is \\( \\neg P \\implies \\neg S \\) (if the pants are not denim, then the shirt is not cotton).\n\nSince we know \\( \\neg P \\) is true (the pants are not denim), we can conclude \\( \\neg S \\) (the shirt is not cotton) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and logical deduction, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
