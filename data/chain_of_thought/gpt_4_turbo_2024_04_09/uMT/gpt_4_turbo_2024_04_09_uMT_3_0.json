The statement given is: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as: If A (the book was written by James), then B (the book is a mystery novel).\n\n2. We are also told: \"The book is not a mystery novel.\" This is stating that B is false.\n\n3. From the structure of the first statement (If A, then B), we know that if A is true, B must also be true. However, since we know B is false (the book is not a mystery novel), A must also be false to maintain logical consistency.\n\n4. Therefore, since B (the book is a mystery novel) is false, A (the book was written by James) must also be false.\n\nThus, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
