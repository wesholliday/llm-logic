The statement given is: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\"\n   This can be written in logical form as: If D (dog inside), then C (cat outside).\n\n2. We are also given that the cat was not outside.\n   This can be written as: Not C.\n\n3. From the logical implication (If D then C), and knowing Not C (the cat was not outside), we can infer Not D (the dog was not inside) by modus tollens. Modus tollens is a rule in logic that states if \"If P then Q\" is true and Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\nTherefore, since the cat was not outside, it follows logically that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
