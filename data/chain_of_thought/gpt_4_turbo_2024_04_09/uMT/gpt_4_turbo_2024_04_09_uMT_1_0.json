            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use logical reasoning based on the given statements:\n\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n   This statement can be represented as: If M, then S. (Where M = Mary was at the wedding, S = Sue was at the wedding)\n\n2. \"Sue was not at the wedding.\"\n   This statement tells us that S is false.\n\nGiven that S is false, and the implication from the first statement (If M, then S), we can infer the following:\n- If M were true (Mary was at the wedding), then S would also have to be true (Sue was at the wedding) to maintain the truth of the implication.\n- However, since we know S is false (Sue was not at the wedding), M must also be false to keep the implication true.\n\nTherefore, if Sue was not at the wedding, Mary could not have been at the wedding either, because Mary being there implies Sue was there, which contradicts the information that Sue was not there.\n\nAnswer: yes",
