            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of logical implication and contrapositive.\n\n1. The statement given is: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" In logical terms, this can be written as: If A (apple is red), then B (banana is yellow).\n\n2. We also know that the banana was not yellow. This can be written as: not B.\n\n3. From logic, we know that the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\n4. Since we know not B (the banana was not yellow) is true, we can use the contrapositive to infer not A (the apple was not red).\n\nTherefore, based on the contrapositive of the original statement, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
