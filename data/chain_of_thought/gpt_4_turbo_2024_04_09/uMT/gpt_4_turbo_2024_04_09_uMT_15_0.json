Here, P represents \"Sam took a plane\" and Q represents \"Erin took a train.\"\n\nWe are also given that \"Erin did not take a train,\" which means Q is false.\n\nIn logic, if we have an implication (If P, then Q) and we know that Q is false, we can conclude that P must also be false. This is because a true premise cannot lead to a false conclusion in a valid logical implication.\n\nTherefore, since Q (Erin took a train) is false, P (Sam took a plane) must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
