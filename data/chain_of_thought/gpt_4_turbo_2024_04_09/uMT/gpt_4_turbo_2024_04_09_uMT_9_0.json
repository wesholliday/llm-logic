            "content": "The statement given is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as: If L (Lisa bought the red shirt), then M (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n\nWe are also given that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, which means M is false.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement (If L then M) is false only when the first part (L) is true and the second part (M) is false. Since we know M is false (Mark did not buy the blue shirt), if L were true (Lisa bought the red shirt), it would make the conditional statement false. However, the problem does not indicate that the conditional statement is false, so we must assume it is true.\n\nTherefore, for the conditional statement to remain true with M being false, L must also be false (Lisa did not buy the red shirt). This is because a conditional statement is true if the first part is false, regardless of the truth value of the second part.\n\nAnswer: yes",
