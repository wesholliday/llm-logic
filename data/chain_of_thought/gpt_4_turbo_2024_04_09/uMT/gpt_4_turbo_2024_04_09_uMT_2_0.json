The contrapositive of \"If G then U\" is \"If not U then not G.\"\n\nSince we know U is false (unicorn was not in the forest), the contrapositive tells us that G must also be false (griffin was not in the forest).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and logical deduction, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
