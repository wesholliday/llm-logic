            "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the logical form of the given statements and apply the rules of logic.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" In logical terms, this can be written as:\n   \\( J \\rightarrow A \\)\n   where \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) represents \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\n2. The second statement is a negation: \"Amy did not play tennis.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( \\neg A \\)\n   where \\( \\neg A \\) represents \"It is not the case that Amy played tennis.\"\n\n3. We need to determine whether Jeff played basketball based on these statements. Using the rules of logic, particularly modus tollens, we can analyze the situation. Modus tollens is a rule that says if \\( p \\rightarrow q \\) is true and \\( \\neg q \\) is true, then \\( \\neg p \\) must also be true.\n\n4. Applying modus tollens to our statements:\n   - \\( p \\rightarrow q \\) corresponds to \\( J \\rightarrow A \\)\n   - \\( \\neg q \\) corresponds to \\( \\neg A \\)\n   - Therefore, \\( \\neg p \\) must be true, which corresponds to \\( \\neg J \\) (Jeff did not play basketball).\n\nThus, based on the given information and the application of modus tollens, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
