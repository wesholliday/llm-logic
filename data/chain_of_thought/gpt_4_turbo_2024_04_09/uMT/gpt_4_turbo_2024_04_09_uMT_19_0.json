            "content": "The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" can be represented as a conditional statement: If P, then Q. Here, P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nWe are also given that \"Jen did not watch basketball,\" which means Q is false.\n\nIn logic, if a conditional statement (If P, then Q) is true and Q is false, then P must also be false to maintain the truth of the conditional statement. This is because a true conditional statement can only be false if P is true and Q is false, which is not the case here.\n\nTherefore, since Q (Jen watched basketball) is false, P (Tom watched football) must also be false to keep the conditional statement true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
