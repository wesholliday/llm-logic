The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\n\nFrom statement 1, we have two possibilities:\n- The jacket is draped over the chair.\n- The jacket is hanging in the closet.\n\nStatement 2 introduces a possibility that the jacket is not hanging in the closet, but it does not confirm this as a fact. It only opens up the possibility.\n\nSince statement 2 does not definitively state that the jacket is not in the closet, but only suggests it might not be, we cannot conclusively infer that the jacket must be draped over the chair. There remains a possibility, however slight, that the jacket could still be in the closet.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: no",
