The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\n\nFrom statement 1, we have two possibilities:\n- The sunglasses are in her bag.\n- The sunglasses are perched on her head.\n\nStatement 2 introduces a possibility that the sunglasses might not be on her head, but it does not confirm that they definitely are not on her head. It only opens up the possibility that they might not be there.\n\nSince statement 2 does not definitively exclude the possibility of the sunglasses being on her head, we cannot conclude with certainty that they must be in her bag. They could still potentially be on her head.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the sunglasses are in her bag based solely on these statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
