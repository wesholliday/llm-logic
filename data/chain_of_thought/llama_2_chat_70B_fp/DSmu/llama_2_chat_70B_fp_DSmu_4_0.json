The second premise \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom\" denies the latter option, meaning the cat is not playing in the bedroom.\n\nBy process of elimination, the only remaining option is that the cat is napping on the couch. Therefore, we can infer \"The cat is napping on the couch\" based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
