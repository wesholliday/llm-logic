The notebook is in the drawer - This scenario is consistent with both statements.\n2. The notebook is sitting on the nightstand - This scenario is inconsistent with the second statement, as it implies that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nSince we've ruled out the second scenario, the only remaining possibility is that the notebook is in the drawer. Therefore, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
