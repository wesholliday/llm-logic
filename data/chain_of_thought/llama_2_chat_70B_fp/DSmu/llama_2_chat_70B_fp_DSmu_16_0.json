The second premise \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk\" denies the possibility that the pen is on the desk. Therefore, we can conclude that the pen is not on the desk.\n\nSince the first premise states that the pen must be either in the bag or on the desk, and we have established that it is not on the desk, we can infer that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
