It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can deduce that the watch is either charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist. Since premise 2 states that it's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist, we can conclude that the watch is not on his wrist. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
