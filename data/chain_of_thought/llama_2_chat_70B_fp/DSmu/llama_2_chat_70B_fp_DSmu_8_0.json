This means that there are only two possible locations for the remote control: the coffee table or under the couch.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch. This means that the remote control cannot be under the couch, as \"must\" implies a necessary condition.\n\nTherefore, since the remote control cannot be under the couch, the only remaining location for it is the coffee table. Hence, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
