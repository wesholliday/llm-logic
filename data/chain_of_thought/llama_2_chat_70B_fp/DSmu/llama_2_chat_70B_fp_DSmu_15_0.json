It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can deduce that the shoes are either in the closet or lined up by the door. Since premise 2 states that the shoes must not be lined up by the door, the only remaining option is that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
