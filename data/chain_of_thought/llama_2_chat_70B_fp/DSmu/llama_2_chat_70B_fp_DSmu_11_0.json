This means that there are only two possible locations for the newspaper: the driveway or the porch.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch. This means that the newspaper cannot be on the porch, as \"must\" implies a necessary condition.\n\nTherefore, by process of elimination, the only possible location for the newspaper is the driveway.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
