This means that if it's not under the bed, then it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed. This means that the possibility of the sock being under the bed is eliminated, leaving only the possibility that it's in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
