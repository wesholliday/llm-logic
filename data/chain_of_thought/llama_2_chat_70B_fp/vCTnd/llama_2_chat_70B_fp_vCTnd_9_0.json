Identify the contrapositive of the premise: The contrapositive of \"If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly\" is \"If instructions were not explained clearly, then instructions were given.\"\n2. Invert the premise: The inverted premise is \"If instructions were not given, then they were explained clearly.\"\n3. Draw a conclusion: Using the inverted premise, we can draw the conclusion \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given.\"\n\nNow, let's compare the conclusion we drew with the original conclusion:\n\nOriginal conclusion: \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given.\"\nDrawn conclusion: \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given.\"\n\nSince the two conclusions match, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
