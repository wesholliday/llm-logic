            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the premise being \"If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently\" and the conclusion being \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study\". In order to determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to assess whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the contrapositive of the premise: The contrapositive of \"If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently\" is \"If Ben did not study diligently, then he studied\".\n2. Invert the premise: The inverted premise is \"If Ben did not study, then he studied diligently\".\n3. Apply modus tollens: Modus tollens is a logical rule that allows us to deduce the negation of the conclusion from the premise and the negation of the conclusion. In this case, the negation of the conclusion is \"Ben did not study diligently\", and the premise is \"If Ben did not study, then he studied diligently\". Therefore, we can deduce \"Ben did not study\".\n4. Apply modus ponens: Modus ponens is a logical rule that allows us to deduce the conclusion from the premise and the conclusion. In this case, the premise is \"If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently\", and the conclusion is \"Ben did not study\". Therefore, we can deduce \"Ben did not study diligently\".\n\nSince we have shown that the conclusion logically follows from the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
