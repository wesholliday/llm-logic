In order to determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the contrapositive of the premise: The contrapositive of \"If Ann exercised, then she did not exercise strenuously\" is \"If Ann did not exercise strenuously, then she exercised\".\n2. Negate the conclusion: The negation of \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise\" is \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did exercise\".\n3. Check if the negated conclusion is equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise: In this case, the negated conclusion \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did exercise\" is equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise \"If Ann did not exercise strenuously, then she exercised\".\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, since the negated conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
