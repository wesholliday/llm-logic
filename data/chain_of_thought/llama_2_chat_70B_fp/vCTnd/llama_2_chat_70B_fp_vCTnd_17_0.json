In other words, we need to see if the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if the customer was greeted, then they were not greeted warmly. This means that if the customer was greeted, then the greeting was not warm.\n\nThe conclusion states that if the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted. This means that if the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted at all.\n\nIf we assume that the premise is true, then we can deduce that if the customer was greeted, then they were not greeted warmly. Therefore, if the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted, which means that the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
