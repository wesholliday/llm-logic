            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the premise \"If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly\" and the conclusion \"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied\". In order to determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to assess whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nLet's break down the premise into its component parts:\n\n* \"If the room was tidied\" - This part of the premise asserts that the room was tidied.\n* \"then it was not tidied thoroughly\" - This part of the premise asserts that if the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion:\n\n* \"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied\" - This part of the conclusion asserts that if the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied.\n\nIn order for the conclusion to logically follow from the premise, we need to be able to deduce the conclusion from the premise using logical reasoning. In this case, we can do that by using modus tollens, a form of logical reasoning that allows us to deduce the negation of the conclusion from the premise.\n\nModus tollens works by negating the conclusion and then using the premise to deduce the negation of the conclusion. In this case, the conclusion is \"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied\", so we can negate it to get \"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was tidied\".\n\nNow, let's see if we can deduce this negated conclusion from the premise using modus tollens:\n\n1. If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly (premise)\n2. If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was tidied (negated conclusion)\n3. Therefore, if the room was tidied, then it was tidied (modus tollens)\n\nAs we can see, the negated conclusion logically follows from the premise using modus tollens, which means that the original conclusion \"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied\" logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid.",
