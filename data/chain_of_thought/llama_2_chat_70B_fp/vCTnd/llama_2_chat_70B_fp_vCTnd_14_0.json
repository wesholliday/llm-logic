            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a type of logical argument known as a contrapositive argument. A contrapositive argument is a type of argument where the conclusion is the negation of the premise, and the premise is the negation of the conclusion. In this case, the premise is \"If the meal was prepared, then it was not prepared carefully,\" and the conclusion is \"If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared.\"\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and conclusion. In a logically valid argument, the conclusion must follow necessarily from the premise. In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the premise states that if the meal was prepared, then it was not prepared carefully. This means that if the meal was prepared, then it is not the case that it was prepared carefully. The conclusion, on the other hand, states that if the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared. This means that if the meal was prepared carefully, then it is not the case that it was prepared.\n\nNotice that the conclusion is simply the negation of the premise. This is a common pattern in contrapositive arguments, where the conclusion is the negation of the premise. In this case, the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise, because if the meal was prepared carefully, then it is not the case that it was prepared, which means that it was not prepared.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
