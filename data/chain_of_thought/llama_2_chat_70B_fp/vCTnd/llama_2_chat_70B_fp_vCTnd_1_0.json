            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the premise \"If it's raining, then it's not raining hard\" and the conclusion \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining.\" In order to determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the contrapositive of the premise: The contrapositive of \"If it's raining, then it's not raining hard\" is \"If it's not raining hard, then it's raining.\"\n2. Invert the premise: The inverted premise is \"If it's not raining, then it's raining hard.\"\n3. Apply modus tollens: Modus tollens is a logical rule that allows us to deduce the negation of the conclusion from the premise and the negation of the conclusion. In this case, the premise is \"If it's not raining, then it's raining hard,\" and the conclusion is \"It's not raining.\" Therefore, we can deduce the negation of the conclusion, which is \"It is raining.\"\n4. Evaluate the argument: Since we have deduced that \"It is raining\" from the premise and the negation of the conclusion, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
