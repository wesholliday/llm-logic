            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the premise \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly\" and the conclusion \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\".\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In other words, we need to see if the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premise.\n\nThe premise states that if the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly. This means that if the room was cleaned, then it must be the case that it was not cleaned thoroughly.\n\nThe conclusion states that if the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned. This is saying that if the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it must be the case that it was not cleaned.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. The room was cleaned:\n\t* If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly (premise).\n\t* Therefore, if the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly.\n2. The room was not cleaned:\n\t* If the room was not cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly (tautology).\n\t* Therefore, if the room was not cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly.\n\nIn both scenarios, the conclusion \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\" logically follows from the premise \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly\".\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
