            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the premise \"If directions were provided, then they were not explained clearly\" and the conclusion \"If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided.\" In order to determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nTo do this, we can use the method of contrapositive reasoning. The contrapositive of the premise is \"If they were not explained clearly, then directions were provided.\" This contrapositive statement is logically equivalent to the original premise, as it states the opposite of the premise in a way that still maintains the same logical relationship between the two parts.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion. The conclusion is \"If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided.\" This statement is logically equivalent to \"If they were explained clearly, then they were not provided.\" This is a contrapositive statement, and it is logically equivalent to the original conclusion.\n\nTherefore, we can see that the argument is logically valid, as the conclusion logically follows from the premise. The argument is structured as a conditional statement, with the premise and conclusion being logically equivalent contrapositive statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
