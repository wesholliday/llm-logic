            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a type of conditional argument, with the premise \"If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth\" and the conclusion \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed.\"\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the contrapositive of the premise: The contrapositive of \"If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth\" is \"If the issue was not discussed in depth, then it was discussed.\"\n2. Convert the premise and contrapositive into their respective negations: The negation of \"If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth\" is \"If the issue was not discussed, then it was discussed in depth,\" and the negation of \"If the issue was not discussed in depth, then it was discussed\" is \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed.\"\n3. Combine the negated premise and contrapositive to form a new argument: The new argument would be \"If the issue was not discussed, then it was discussed in depth; if the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed.\"\n4. Determine if the new argument is logically valid: The new argument is logically valid because it is a tautology, meaning that its conclusion logically follows from its premises.\n\nTherefore, the original argument is also logically valid, since its conclusion logically follows from its premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
