            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the premise being \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much\" and the conclusion being \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise\". In order to determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to assess whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the contrapositive of the premise: The contrapositive of \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much\" is \"If Alex did not exercise much, then he exercised\".\n2. Invert the premise: The inverted premise is \"If Alex did not exercise much, then he exercised\".\n3. Apply modus tollens: Modus tollens is a logical rule that allows us to deduce the negation of the conclusion from the premise and the negation of the conclusion. In this case, the negation of the conclusion is \"Alex did not exercise\", and the premise is \"If Alex did not exercise much, then he exercised\". Therefore, we can deduce \"Alex did not exercise\" from the premise.\n4. Check for validity: Since we have deduced the negation of the conclusion from the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
