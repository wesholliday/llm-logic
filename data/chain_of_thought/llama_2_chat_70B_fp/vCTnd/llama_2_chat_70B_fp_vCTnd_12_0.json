In order to determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the contrapositive of the premise: The contrapositive of \"If Jane studied, then she did not study long\" is \"If Jane did not study long, then she studied\".\n2. Invert the premise: The inverted premise is \"If Jane did not study long, then she did not study\".\n3. Evaluate the argument: We can now see that the conclusion \"If Jane studied long, then she did not study\" logically follows from the inverted premise \"If Jane did not study long, then she did not study\".\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
