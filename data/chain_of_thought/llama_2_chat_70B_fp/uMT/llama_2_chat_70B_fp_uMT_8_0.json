            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" implies that the vampire's awakeness implies the mummy's awakeness. In other words, if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must be awake too.\n\nThe statement \"the mummy was not awake\" contradicts the first statement. If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire's awakeness cannot imply the mummy's awakeness. In other words, the mummy's lack of awakeness breaks the logical connection between the vampire's and mummy's awakeness.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
