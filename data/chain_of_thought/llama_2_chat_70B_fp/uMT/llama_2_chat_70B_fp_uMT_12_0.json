This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Joe going to the park) is true, then the second part (Lucy going to the zoo) must also be true.\n2. Lucy did not go to the zoo. This statement is a fact, and it means that the second part of the conditional statement (Lucy going to the zoo) is false.\n3. If the second part of the conditional statement is false, then we can conclude that the first part (Joe going to the park) is also false. This is because the conditional statement implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would have gone to the zoo, but since Lucy did not go to the zoo, it's clear that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo.",
