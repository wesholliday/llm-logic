However, we know that the truck was not metal, which means that the doll being plastic would not necessarily make the truck metal.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the doll being plastic does not necessarily imply that the truck was metal. Since we know that the truck was not metal, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: No.",
