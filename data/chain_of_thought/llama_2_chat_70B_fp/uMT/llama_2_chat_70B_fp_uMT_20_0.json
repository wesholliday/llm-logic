            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement. It implies that the redness of the apple is sufficient to conclude that the banana is yellow.\n\nThe statement \"the banana was not yellow\" is a negation of the consequent of the conditional statement. It means that the banana did not have the property of being yellow.\n\nWhen we negate the consequent of a conditional statement, we can infer that the antecedent (the part before the \"if\") is false. In this case, the antecedent is \"the apple was red.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
