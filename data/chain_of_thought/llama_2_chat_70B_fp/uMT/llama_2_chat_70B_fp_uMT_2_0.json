(This is a conditional statement, where the presence of the griffin implies the presence of the unicorn.)\n2. The unicorn was not in the forest. (This is a statement of fact, telling us that the unicorn was not present in the forest.)\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn would have been in the forest as well, since the presence of the griffin implies the presence of the unicorn. However, since the unicorn was not in the forest, it's not possible for the griffin to have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: No",
