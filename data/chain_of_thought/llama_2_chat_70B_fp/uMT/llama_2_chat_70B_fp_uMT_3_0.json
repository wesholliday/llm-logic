The book is not a mystery novel.\n\nFrom 1, we can infer that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel.\n\nFrom 2, we know that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's consider two possible cases:\n\nCase 1: The book was written by James.\n\nIf the book was written by James, then according to 1, it should be a mystery novel. However, we know from 2 that it is not a mystery novel, which contradicts our assumption. Therefore, we can conclude that the book was not written by James.\n\nCase 2: The book was not written by James.\n\nIf the book was not written by James, then it is not a mystery novel, which aligns with our knowledge from 2. In this case, we don't have any information to suggest that the book was written by James, so we can conclude that it was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that the book was not written by James.",
