(This is a conditional statement, where the truth of the second part follows logically from the first part.)\n2. Chris did not finish the race. (This is a statement of fact.)\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race. This is because, if Alex had finished the race, then Chris would have finished the race as well, since the first statement implies that Chris finishing the race is a logical consequence of Alex finishing the race. However, since Chris did not finish the race, it means that Alex did not finish the race either.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
