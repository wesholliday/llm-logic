            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on the following premises:\n\n1. The splat did not quank.\n2. If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\n\nWe want to infer whether the splat was not morphed.\n\nLet's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The splat did not quank.\n\nThis premise tells us that the splat did not perform the action of quanking.\n\n2. If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\n\nThis premise establishes a conditional relationship between the splat being morphed and the splat quanking. It means that if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion we want to draw:\n\nThe splat was not morphed.\n\nIf we can prove that the splat was not morphed, then we can infer that it did not quank, which aligns with the first premise.\n\nSo, how can we use the premises to infer that the splat was not morphed?\n\nWe can do this by using modus tollens, a logical rule that allows us to deduce the negation of the conclusion of a conditional statement when the antecedent is false. In this case, the conditional statement is \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\"\n\nHere's how modus tollens applies:\n\n1. The splat did not quank (premise 1).\n2. If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked (premise 2).\n3. Therefore, the splat was not morphed (conclusion).\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The splat did not quank (premise 1).\n2. If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked (premise 2).\n3. Since the splat did not quank (premise 1), it means that the condition in premise 2 (the splat was morphed) cannot be true.\n4. Therefore, the splat was not morphed (conclusion).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
