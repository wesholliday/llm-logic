If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer 'The smip was not shripped' from these statements.\n\nLet's break down the second statement:\n\n2. If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.\n\nThis statement is in the form of a conditional, where the hypothesis is 'the smip was shripped' and the conclusion is 'the smip lupped the zoint'.\n\nNow, let's consider the first statement:\n\n1. The smip did not lup the zoint.\n\nThis statement tells us that the smip did not perform the action of luping the zoint.\n\nUsing the second statement, we can deduce that if the smip was shripped, then it would have lupped the zoint. Since the smip did not lup the zoint, we can conclude that it was not shripped.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The smip was not shripped' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
