The flugel was not blimmed: In this case, the flugel did not undergo the process of blimming, and therefore, it did not undergo the process of zargling either, since zargling only occurs after blimming. This scenario is consistent with the given information.\n2. The flugel was blimmed: In this case, the flugel did undergo the process of blimming, which means it should have also undergone the process of zargling, according to the second statement. However, this contradicts the first statement, which states that the flugel was not zargled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
