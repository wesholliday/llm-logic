We need to determine if we can infer \"The shank was not plooked\" from these two statements.\n\nLet's break down the conditional statement:\n\n* If the shank was plooked (p), then the shank was nugged (n)\n\nThe negation of this statement would be:\n\n* If the shank was not plooked (not p), then the shank was not nugged (not n)\n\nNow, let's combine this with the premise:\n\n* The shank was not nugged (not n)\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can conclude:\n\n* Therefore, the shank was not plooked (not p)\n\nAnswer: Yes",
