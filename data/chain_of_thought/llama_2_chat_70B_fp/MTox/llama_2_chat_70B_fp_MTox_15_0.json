            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on a conditional statement \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\" and a negated statement \"The dreb was not spened\". We need to determine if we can infer \"The dreb was not vroombed\" based on these two statements.\n\nLet's break down the conditional statement:\n\n* \"If the dreb was vroombed\" - This is the hypothesis or the premise of the statement.\n* \"then the dreb was spened\" - This is the conclusion or the consequence of the statement.\n\nNow, let's analyze the negated statement:\n\n* \"The dreb was not spened\" - This statement negates the conclusion of the conditional statement.\n\nIf we assume that the conditional statement is true, then we can deduce that if the dreb was vroombed, it would have been spened. However, since we know that the dreb was not spened, we can conclude that it was not vroombed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer \"The dreb was not vroombed\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
