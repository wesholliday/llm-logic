However, the first statement states that the twonk was not varnished, which contradicts this scenario. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\nScenario 2: The twonk was not plinked\nIf the twonk was not plinked, then it does not have to be varnished, according to the second statement. This scenario is consistent with the first statement, which states that the twonk was not varnished.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
