If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the sneg did not sproted the frink.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that if the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nIf we assume that the sneg was crampled, then according to statement 2, the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nHowever, we know from statement 1 that the sneg did not sproted the frink.\n\nTherefore, we have a contradiction, which means that our assumption that the sneg was crampled must be false.\n\nSo, we can infer that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
