We need to determine if we can infer \"The glip was not slogged\" from these two pieces of information.\n\nLet's break down the conditional statement:\n\n* If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged (premise)\n* The glip was not tragged (premise)\n\nWe can conclude that:\n\n* If the glip was slogged, then the glip was not tragged (modus tollens)\n\nNow, let's apply this conclusion to the premise \"The glip was not tragged\":\n\n* The glip was not tragged (premise)\n* If the glip was slogged, then the glip was not tragged (conclusion)\n\nWe can infer that:\n\n* The glip was not slogged (conclusion)\n\nAnswer: Yes",
