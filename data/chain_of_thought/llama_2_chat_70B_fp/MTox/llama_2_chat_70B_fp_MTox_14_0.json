            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on a conditional statement \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\" and a negation \"The clug did not snugged\". We need to determine if we can infer \"The clug was not fleeked\" from these two premises.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged (premise 1)\n2. The clug did not snugged (premise 2)\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if the clug was fleeked, then it snugged. Now, let's consider two possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The clug was fleeked\nIn this scenario, the clug was fleeked, and according to premise 1, it snugged. However, premise 2 states that the clug did not snugged, which contradicts the conclusion from premise 1. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\nScenario 2: The clug was not fleeked\nIn this scenario, the clug was not fleeked, and therefore, it did not snugged, which aligns with premise 2.\n\nSince scenario 1 is not possible, and scenario 2 is consistent with the premises, we can conclude that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
