            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on a conditional statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" and a negation statement \"The fleeg did not surn\". We need to determine if we can infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" from these two statements.\n\nLet's break down the conditional statement:\n\n* If the fleeg was bluttered (premise)\n* Then it surned (conclusion)\n\nThe negation statement says that the conclusion (it surned) is false. So, we can deduce that the premise (the fleeg was bluttered) must also be false, otherwise, the conclusion would be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
