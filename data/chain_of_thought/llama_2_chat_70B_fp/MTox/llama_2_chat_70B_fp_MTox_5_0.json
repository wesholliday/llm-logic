            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on a conditional statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\" and a premise \"The zinger was not smoogled\". We want to infer \"The zinger was not fraggled\".\n\nFirst, let's break down the conditional statement:\n\n* \"If the zinger was fraggled\" - This is the hypothesis or the antecedent of the conditional statement.\n* \"then the zinger was smoogled\" - This is the conclusion or the consequent of the conditional statement.\n\nNow, let's analyze the premise:\n\n* \"The zinger was not smoogled\" - This is the negation of the conclusion of the conditional statement.\n\nUsing the laws of logic, we can infer the negation of the hypothesis from the premise:\n\n* \"The zinger was not smoogled\" implies \"The zinger was not fraggled\" (by modus tollens)\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The zinger was not fraggled\" from the premise \"The zinger was not smoogled\" and the conditional statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
