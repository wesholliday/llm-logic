            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on a conditional statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" and a negation statement \"The wug was not garpled\". We need to determine if we can infer \"The wug was not sproinged\" based on these two statements.\n\nLet's break down the conditional statement:\n\n* If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled (premise 1)\n\nThe negation statement is:\n\n* The wug was not garpled (premise 2)\n\nWe can now use modus tollens, a logical rule of inference, to deduce a conclusion from the premises:\n\n* Modus tollens: If A, then B. Not B. Therefore, not A.\n\nIn this case, A is \"the wug was sproinged\" and B is \"the wug was garpled\".\n\nSo, we can infer:\n\n* If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled (premise 1)\n* The wug was not garpled (premise 2)\n* Therefore, the wug was not sproinged (conclusion)\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
