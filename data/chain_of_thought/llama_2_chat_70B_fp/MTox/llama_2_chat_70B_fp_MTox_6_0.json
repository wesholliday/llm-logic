If the grommet was sploffed, then according to the second statement, the grommet plopped the frink. However, we know that the grommet did not plop the frink, which means that our assumption that the grommet was sploffed leads to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
