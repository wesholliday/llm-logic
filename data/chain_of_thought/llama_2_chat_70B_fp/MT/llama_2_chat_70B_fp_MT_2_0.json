            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nLet's break down the given information:\n\n* \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" - This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest.\n* \"The unicorn was not in the forest\" - This statement tells us that the unicorn is not in the forest.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. The griffin is in the forest.\n\t* If the griffin is in the forest, then according to the first statement, the unicorn must also be in the forest.\n\t* However, we know that the unicorn is not in the forest, which means that this scenario is impossible.\n2. The griffin is not in the forest.\n\t* If the griffin is not in the forest, then the unicorn doesn't have to be in the forest either, as the conditional statement doesn't apply.\n\t* This scenario is consistent with the given information, as we know that the unicorn is not in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
