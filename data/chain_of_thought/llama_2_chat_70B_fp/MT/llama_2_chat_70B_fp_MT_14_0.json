The bear is in the cave. In this case, according to the first statement, the wolf should be in the den. However, we know that the wolf is not in the den, which means that this scenario is not possible.\n2. The bear is not in the cave. In this case, the wolf doesn't have to be in the den, as the conditional statement doesn't apply.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the bear is not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
