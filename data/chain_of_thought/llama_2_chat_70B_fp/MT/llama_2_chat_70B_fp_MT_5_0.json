Jeff played basketball - This would mean that Amy played tennis, according to the conditional statement. However, we know that Amy did not play tennis, so this scenario is impossible.\n2. Jeff did not play basketball - This would mean that Amy did not play tennis, which is consistent with the given information.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
