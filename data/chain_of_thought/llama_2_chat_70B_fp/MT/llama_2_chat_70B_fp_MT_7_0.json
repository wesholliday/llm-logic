This is a conditional statement, where the truth of the second part (Chris finished the race) depends on the truth of the first part (Alex finished the race).\n* \"Chris did not finish the race\" means that the second part of the conditional statement is false.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. Alex finished the race: In this case, the first part of the conditional statement is true, and since the second part is false, we can infer that Chris did not finish the race. This scenario does not help us infer whether Alex finished the race or not.\n2. Alex did not finish the race: In this case, the first part of the conditional statement is false, which means that Chris finished the race is also false. This scenario allows us to infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
