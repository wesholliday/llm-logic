We can use De Morgan's law to deduce that \u00ac(P \u2227 T) is equivalent to \u00acP \u2228 \u00acT.\n\n* \u00ac(P \u2227 T) \u2194 \u00acP \u2228 \u00acT (De Morgan's law)\n* \u00acP \u2228 \u00acT (from \u00acP and \u00acT)\n\nTherefore, we have \u00acP \u2228 \u00acT.\n\nNow, we can use the law of non-contradiction to deduce that \u00acP \u2228 \u00acT is equivalent to \u00ac(P \u2227 T).\n\n* \u00acP \u2228 \u00acT \u2194 \u00ac(P \u2227 T) (law of non-contradiction)\n* \u00ac(P \u2227 T) (from \u00acP \u2228 \u00acT)\n\nTherefore, we have \u00ac(P \u2227 T).\n\nFinally, we can use the law of contrapositive to deduce that \u00ac(P \u2227 T) is equivalent to \u00acP \u2228 \u00acT.\n\n* \u00ac(P \u2227 T) \u2194 \u00acP \u2228 \u00acT (law of contrapositive)\n* \u00acP \u2228 \u00acT (from \u00ac(P \u2227 T))\n\nTherefore, we have \u00acP \u2228 \u00acT.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
