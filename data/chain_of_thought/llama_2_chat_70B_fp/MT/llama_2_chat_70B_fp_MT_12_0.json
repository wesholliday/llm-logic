In other words, the truth of the first premise implies the truth of the second premise.\n\nTherefore, if we know that Lucy did not go to the zoo, we can conclude that the first premise is false. In other words, \u00acZ implies \u00acJ \u2192 P.\n\nNow, we have \u00acJ \u2192 P and \u00acP. Using modus tollens, we can deduce \u00acJ.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
