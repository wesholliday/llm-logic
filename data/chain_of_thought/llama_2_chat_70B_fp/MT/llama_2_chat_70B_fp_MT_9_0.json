            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nLet's break down the given information:\n\n* \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" - This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the premise (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the conclusion (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true.\n* \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" - This statement negates the conclusion of the conditional statement.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. Lisa bought the red shirt:\n\t* If Lisa bought the red shirt, then according to the conditional statement, Mark should have bought the blue shirt.\n\t* However, since Mark did not buy the blue shirt, this scenario is inconsistent with the given information.\n2. Lisa did not buy the red shirt:\n\t* If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then the conditional statement does not apply, and Mark's action is independent of Lisa's.\n\t* Since Mark did not buy the blue shirt, this scenario is consistent with the given information.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
