Ben ate pasta - This would mean that Kate should have eaten the salad, according to the conditional statement. However, we know that Kate did not eat the salad, which contradicts this scenario.\n2. Ben did not eat pasta - This would mean that Kate did not have to eat the salad, since the premise of the conditional statement is false. This scenario is consistent with the information we have.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
