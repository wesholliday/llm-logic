If the dog was inside, then the cat must be outside.\n* \"The cat was not outside\" - This statement negates the possibility that the cat was outside.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. The dog was inside:\n\t* If the dog was inside, then the cat must be outside (according to the first statement).\n\t* But the cat was not outside, so this scenario is impossible.\n2. The dog was outside:\n\t* If the dog was outside, then the cat could be either inside or outside.\n\t* Since the cat was not outside, it must be inside.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the dog was outside.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
