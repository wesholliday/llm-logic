If the shoes are not lined up by the door, then they must be in the closet.\n2. If the shoes are not in the closet, then they must be lined up by the door (since this is the only other location mentioned).\n\nSince we know that the shoes are not lined up by the door, we can conclude that they must be in the closet.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
