If the pen is not on the desk, then it must be in the bag.\n2. If the pen is not in the bag, then it must be on the desk (since we've already established that it's not on the desk).\n\nSince scenario 2 is impossible (given that the pen isn't on the desk), the only possible scenario left is scenario 1, where the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
