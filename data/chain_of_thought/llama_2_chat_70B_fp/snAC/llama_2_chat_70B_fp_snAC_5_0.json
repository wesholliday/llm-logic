If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis, according to premise 1. Since Amy played tennis, as stated in premise 2, it means that the condition in premise 1 has been met, and therefore, Jeff played basketball.\n\nIn other words, the truth of premise 2 (Amy played tennis) implies the truth of the antecedent in premise 1 (Jeff played basketball), which in turn implies the truth of the consequent in premise 1 (Amy played tennis). This is an example of modus ponens, a valid logical argument form.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, it necessarily follows that Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
