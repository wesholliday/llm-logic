            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nWe are given two premises:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n2. The book is a mystery novel.\n\nWe want to determine if the conclusion \"The book was written by James\" necessarily follows from these premises.\n\nLet's break down the first premise:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n\nThis premise is in the form of a conditional statement. It states that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. In other words, the book being a mystery novel is a consequence of it being written by James.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise:\n\n2. The book is a mystery novel.\n\nThis premise simply states that the book is a mystery novel. It doesn't tell us anything about who wrote it.\n\nNow, let's put the two premises together:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n2. The book is a mystery novel.\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. Since the second premise tells us that the book is a mystery novel, we can conclude that it is possible that the book was written by James.\n\nHowever, we cannot say for certain that the book was written by James without additional information. It's possible that the book was written by someone else, and it just happens to be a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The book was written by James\" does not necessarily follow from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
