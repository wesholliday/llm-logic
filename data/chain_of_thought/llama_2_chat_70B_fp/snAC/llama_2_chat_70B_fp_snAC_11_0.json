The muffins were blueberry.\n\nWe need to determine if the conclusion \"The cake was chocolate\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nLet's break down the first statement:\n\n1. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n\nThis statement implies that the cake being chocolate is a sufficient condition for the muffins to be blueberry. In other words, if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement:\n\n2. The muffins were blueberry.\n\nThis statement asserts that the muffins were indeed blueberry.\n\nNow, let's put the two statements together:\n\n1. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n2. The muffins were blueberry.\n\nGiven that the muffins were blueberry (statement 2), it follows that the cake must have been chocolate (statement 1). In other words, if the muffins were blueberry, then the cake must have been chocolate, since the muffins being blueberry is a sufficient condition for the cake to be chocolate.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The cake was chocolate\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
