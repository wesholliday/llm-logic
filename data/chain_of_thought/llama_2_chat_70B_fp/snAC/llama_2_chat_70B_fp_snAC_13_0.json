The truck was blue.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. Since statement 2 states that the truck was blue, we can conclude that the car was red.\n\nHowever, we need to be careful here. Just because the truck was blue doesn't necessarily mean that the car was red. There could be other factors at play that affect the color of the car. For example, the car could have been blue as well, or it could have been a different color altogether.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that \"The car was red\" is true based solely on the given statements. We need more information to confirm the color of the car.\n\nAnswer: No.",
