If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train (premise 1).\n2. Erin took a train (premise 2).\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. Since we know that Erin took a train (premise 2), we can conclude that Sam took a plane.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Sam took a plane\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
