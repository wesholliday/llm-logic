If the bear was not in the cave, then according to Premise 1, the wolf was not in the den. However, we know that the wolf was in the den (Premise 2), which means that our assumption that the bear was not in the cave leads to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, we must conclude that the bear was in the cave.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
