            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" implies a causal relationship between Lisa's action and Mark's action. It suggests that Mark's decision to buy the blue shirt was influenced by Lisa's decision to buy the red shirt.\n\nIf we negate the premise by saying \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt,\" we can conclude that the condition that led to Mark buying the blue shirt is no longer met. Therefore, it is not necessarily true that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nIn other words, the statement \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" is not necessarily true. There could be other factors that influenced Mark's decision to buy the blue shirt, or he might have simply chosen not to buy anything.\n\nAnswer: No.",
