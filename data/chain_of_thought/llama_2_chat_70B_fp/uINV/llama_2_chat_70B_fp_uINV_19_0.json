            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This statement implies that there is a direct relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball. In other words, if Tom watched football, then it is certain that Jen watched basketball.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball, we need to examine the relationship between the two statements.\n\nIf Tom did not watch football, then the original statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" does not apply. In this case, we cannot conclude that Jen watched basketball.\n\nHowever, we can consider the contrapositive of the original statement, which is \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\" This statement implies that there is also a direct relationship between Jen not watching basketball and Tom not watching football.\n\nTherefore, if Tom did not watch football, then we can infer that Jen did not watch basketball, based on the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
