            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A is \"the shirt was cotton\" and B is \"the pants were denim.\" The statement implies that there is a direct relationship between the material of the shirt and the material of the pants. Specifically, if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim, we need to consider the possibility of the converse of the original statement being true. The converse of the statement would be \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nIf the converse is true, then we can infer that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim. However, we cannot assume that the converse is true without additional information. Therefore, we cannot make the desired inference.\n\nAnswer: No.",
