It implies that the occurrence of one event (Sam taking a plane) leads to the certainty of the other event (Erin taking a train).\n\nTo determine if we can infer that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train, we need to negate the original statement.\n\nNegating the statement gives us:\n\n\"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\"\n\nThis is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
