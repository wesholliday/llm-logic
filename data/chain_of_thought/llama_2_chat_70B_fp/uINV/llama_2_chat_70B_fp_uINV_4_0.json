In other words, if the original statement is true, the negated statement is false, and if the original statement is false, the negated statement is true.\n\nTherefore, to negate the given statement, we need to switch the order of the clauses. So, the negated statement would be:\n\n\"If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter.\"\n\nThis statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, but with the order of the clauses reversed.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
