            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This statement implies that there is a causal relationship between Joe's action of going to the park and Lucy's action of going to the zoo. In other words, Joe's going to the park is sufficient to guarantee that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's consider the negation of the statement. If Joe did not go to the park, then the statement becomes \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" This statement is logically equivalent to \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" because the negation of the premise (Joe did not go to the park) leads to the negation of the conclusion (Lucy did not go to the zoo).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
