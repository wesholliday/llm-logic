The statement does not provide any information about the possibility of Chris finishing the race if Alex did not finish.\n\nTo infer that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race, we would need additional information or assumptions. For example, if we know that Alex and Chris were running together and that Chris is slower than Alex, then we could infer that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris would not have been able to finish either. However, without such additional information or assumptions, we cannot logically infer the desired conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No.",
