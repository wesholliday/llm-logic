In other words, if the original statement is true, then the negated statement is false, and if the original statement is false, then the negated statement is true.\n\nTherefore, to negate the given statement, we need to switch the positions of A and B. So, the negated statement would be \"If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\"\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo.",
