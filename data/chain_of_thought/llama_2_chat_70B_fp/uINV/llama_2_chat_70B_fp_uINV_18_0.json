In other words, if the original statement is true, the negated statement is false, and if the original statement is false, the negated statement is true.\n\nTo negate the given statement, we need to switch the positions of A and B. So, the negated statement would be \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: No",
