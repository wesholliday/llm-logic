In other words, if the original statement is true, the negated statement is false, and if the original statement is false, the negated statement is true.\n\nTherefore, to negate the given statement, we need to switch the order of the clauses and negate the second clause. So, the negated statement would be:\n\n\"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\"\n\nThis statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, and we can infer that if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
