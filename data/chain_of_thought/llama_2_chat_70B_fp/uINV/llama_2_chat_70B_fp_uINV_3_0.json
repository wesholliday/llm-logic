In this case, the negation of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\nTherefore, if we negate the given statement, we get:\n\nIf not (the book was written by James), then not (the book is a mystery novel).\n\nThis negated statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, but with the antecedent negated. In other words, if the book was not written by James, then it is not necessarily a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: No.",
