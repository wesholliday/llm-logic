This is an example of a conditional statement, where the truth of the statement depends on the conditions stated.\n\nIn this case, we want to infer the opposite of the statement, that is, if the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside. To do this, we need to use the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" is \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
