The second premise \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet\" implies that the second option, the keys being in the cabinet, is not certain.\n\nIf the keys are not in the cabinet, then the first option, the keys being in the drawer, becomes the only possible location for the keys. Therefore, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
