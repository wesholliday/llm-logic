This means that there are only two possible locations for the missing puzzle piece: the box or the floor.\n\nThe second premise suggests that the missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor. This means that there is a possibility that the missing puzzle piece is not on the floor, which implies that it could be in the box.\n\nSince the only two possible locations for the missing puzzle piece are the box and the floor, and we have reason to believe that it might not be on the floor, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
