Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" and we know that A is true, then we can deduce that B is true.\n\nIn this case, we have the conditional statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" We know that the consequent of this statement, \"Amy played tennis,\" is true. Therefore, we can deduce that the antecedent, \"Jeff played basketball,\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
