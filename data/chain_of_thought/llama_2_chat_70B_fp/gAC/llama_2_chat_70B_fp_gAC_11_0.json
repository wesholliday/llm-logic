The muffins were blueberry.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that the cake being chocolate is a sufficient condition for the muffins to be blueberry. In other words, if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the muffins were indeed blueberry. This means that the sufficient condition mentioned in statement 1 has been met, which implies that the cake must have been chocolate.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, it follows that the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
