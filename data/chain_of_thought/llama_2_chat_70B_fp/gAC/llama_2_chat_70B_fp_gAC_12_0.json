If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo (given)\n2. Lucy went to the zoo (given)\n3. Therefore, Joe went to the park (conclusion)\n\nWe can use modus ponens, a logical rule of inference, to arrive at the conclusion. Modus ponens states that if a conditional statement is true and the antecedent is true, then the consequent must be true. In this case, the conditional statement is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo,\" and the antecedent is \"Joe went to the park.\" The consequent is \"Lucy went to the zoo,\" which is true by the second given statement. Therefore, we can conclude that \"Joe went to the park\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
