The clug might not have been snugged.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the clug was fleeked, then it must have been snugged. However, premise 2 states that the clug might not have been snugged. This means that the clug might not have been fleeked, since snugging is a necessary condition for fleeking.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
