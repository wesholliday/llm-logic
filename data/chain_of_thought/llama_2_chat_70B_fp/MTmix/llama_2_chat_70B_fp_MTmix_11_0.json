The flug might not have been zimmed.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed. However, premise 2 states that the flug might not have been zimmed. This means that we cannot conclusively say that the flug was blummed, as there is a possibility that it was not zimmed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The flug was not blummed\" from the given premises. The possibility that the flug was not zimmed means that we cannot rule out the possibility that it was blummed.\n\nAnswer: No.",
