The zinger might not have been smoogled.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the zinger was fraggled, then it must have been smoogled. However, premise 2 states that the zinger might not have been smoogled, which means that we cannot conclude that the zinger was fraggled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The zinger was not fraggled\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
