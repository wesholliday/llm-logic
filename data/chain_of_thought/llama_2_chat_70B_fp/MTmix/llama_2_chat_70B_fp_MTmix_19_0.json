The smonk might not have plagged.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the smonk was vreebled, then it must have plagged. However, premise 2 states that the smonk might not have plagged. This means that the smonk's plagging is uncertain.\n\nIf the smonk's plagging is uncertain, then we cannot conclusively say that the smonk was vreebled. The possibility that the smonk might not have plagged means that it might not have been vreebled either.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we cannot infer that the smonk was not vreebled. The most we can say is that the smonk's vreebledness is uncertain.\n\nAnswer: No.",
