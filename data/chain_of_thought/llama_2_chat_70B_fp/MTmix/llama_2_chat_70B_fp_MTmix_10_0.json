It might not have been garpled.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled. This means that if the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that it might not have been garpled. This means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the wug was garpled.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can infer that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
