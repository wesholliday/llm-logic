The dreb might not have been spened.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the dreb was vroombed, then it must have been spened. However, premise 2 states that the dreb might not have been spened. This means that the dreb might not have been vroombed, since if it was vroombed, it would have been spened.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
