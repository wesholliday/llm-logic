The sneg might not have sproted the frink.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the sneg was crampled, then the frink must have been sproted.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that the sneg might not have sproted the frink.\n\nIf the sneg might not have sproted the frink, then it is possible that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
