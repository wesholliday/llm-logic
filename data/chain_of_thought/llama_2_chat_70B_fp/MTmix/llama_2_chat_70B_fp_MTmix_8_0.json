The sprocket might not have been daggled.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled. However, premise 2 states that the sprocket might not have been daggled. This means that there is a possibility that the sprocket was not daggled, even if it was cranked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we cannot infer with certainty that the sprocket was not cranked. The possibility that the sprocket was not daggled, even if it was cranked, leaves room for doubt.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The sprocket was not cranked' from the given premises.",
