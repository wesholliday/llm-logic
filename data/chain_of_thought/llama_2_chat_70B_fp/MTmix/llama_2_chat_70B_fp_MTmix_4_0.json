The fribble might not have crinked.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked. This means that if the fribble did not crink, then it was not snurgled.\n\nPremise 2 states that the fribble might not have crinked. This means that it is possible that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can infer that it is possible that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
