The shank might not have been nugged.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged. However, premise 2 states that the shank might not have been nugged. This means that we cannot conclusively say that the shank was plooked, as the possibility exists that it might not have been nugged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The shank was not plooked\" from the given premises. The possibility that the shank was not plooked exists, but we cannot conclude it with certainty based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
