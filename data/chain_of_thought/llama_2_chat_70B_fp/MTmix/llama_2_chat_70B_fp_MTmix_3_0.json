The splat might not have quanked.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked. However, premise 2 states that the splat might not have quanked. This means that the splat's quanking is uncertain.\n\nIf the splat's quanking is uncertain, then we cannot conclusively say that the splat was morphed. In other words, the fact that the splat might not have quanked means that we cannot use the first premise to infer that the splat was morphed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The splat was not morphed' from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
