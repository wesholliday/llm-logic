The glip might not have tragged.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the glip was slogged, then it must have tragged. However, premise 2 states that the glip might not have tragged. This means that the glip might not have been slogged, as it is possible that it did not tragg.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the glip was not slogged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
