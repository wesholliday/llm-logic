The grommet might not have plopped the frink.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the grommet was sploffed, then the frink must have been plopped. However, premise 2 states that the grommet might not have plopped the frink, which means that the grommet might not have been sploffed.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can infer that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
