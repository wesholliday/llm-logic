The flugel might not have been zargled.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the flugel was blimmed, then it must have been zargled. However, premise 2 states that the flugel might not have been zargled. This means that we cannot conclusively say that the flugel was blimmed, as it might not have been zargled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The flugel was not blimmed\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
