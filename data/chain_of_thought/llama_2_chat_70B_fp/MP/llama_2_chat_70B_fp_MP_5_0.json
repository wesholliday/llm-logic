            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information consists of two parts:\n\n1. \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" - This is a conditional statement, where the truth of the conclusion (Amy played tennis) is dependent on the truth of the premise (Jeff played basketball).\n2. \"Jeff played basketball\" - This is a statement of fact, indicating that the premise of the conditional statement is true.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"Amy played tennis\" from the given information, we need to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe argument is valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is \"Amy played tennis,\" and the premises are \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" and \"Jeff played basketball.\"\n\nWe can use modus ponens, a rule of inference, to deduce the conclusion from the premises. Modus ponens states that if a conditional statement is true, and the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) is true, then the consequent (Amy played tennis) must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
