            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information is in the form of a conditional statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" and a separate statement \"Lisa bought the red shirt\". To determine if we can infer \"Mark bought the blue shirt\", we need to assess whether the conditional statement is true and if it is, whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe conditional statement is in the form of \"If A, then B\", where A is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and B is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\". The statement is true if whenever A is true, B is also true. In this case, we know that A is true because Lisa did buy the red shirt. Therefore, the conditional statement is true.\n\nNow, we need to check if the conclusion \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" logically follows from the premises. Since the conditional statement is true and we know that A (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, we can conclude that B (Mark bought the blue shirt) is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
