            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information is in the form of a conditional statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" and a premise \"Alex finished the race\". To determine if we can infer \"Chris finished the race\", we need to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe argument is valid if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is \"Chris finished the race\" and the premises are \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" and \"Alex finished the race\".\n\nWe can use modus ponens, a rule of inference, to deduce the conclusion from the premises. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, then we can conclude that B is true.\n\nIn this case, we have the conditional statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" and we know that Alex finished the race. Therefore, we can apply modus ponens to deduce that Chris finished the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
