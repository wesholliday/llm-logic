To determine if we can infer \"Lucy went to the zoo\", we need to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe argument is valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the premises are \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" and \"Joe went to the park\". If we assume the premises are true, then we can deduce the conclusion \"Lucy went to the zoo\" using modus ponens, a rule of inference that allows us to conclude the consequent of a conditional statement when the antecedent is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer \"Lucy went to the zoo\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
