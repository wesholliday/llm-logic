The apple was red.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer the conclusion \"The banana was yellow\" from these premises.\n\nLet's break down the first premise:\n\n* \"If the apple was red\" - This is a conditional statement, meaning that the conclusion \"then the banana was yellow\" follows logically if the premise \"the apple was red\" is true.\n* \"then the banana was yellow\" - This is the conclusion of the conditional statement.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise:\n\n* \"The apple was red\" - This statement is a fact, indicating that the apple had the property of being red.\n\nUsing modus ponens, a logical rule of inference, we can conclude:\n\n* The apple was red (fact)\n* If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow (premise 1)\n* Therefore, the banana was yellow (conclusion)\n\nSo, we can infer the conclusion \"The banana was yellow\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
