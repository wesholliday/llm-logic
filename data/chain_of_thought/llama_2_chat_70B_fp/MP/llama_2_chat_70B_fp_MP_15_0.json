To determine if we can infer \"Erin took a train\", we need to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe argument is valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is \"Erin took a train\" and the premises are \"Sam took a plane\" and \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\".\n\nThe conditional statement implies that whenever Sam takes a plane, Erin takes a train. The premise \"Sam took a plane\" indicates that the condition in the conditional statement has been satisfied. Therefore, we can infer that Erin took a train.\n\nAnswer:\nYes.",
