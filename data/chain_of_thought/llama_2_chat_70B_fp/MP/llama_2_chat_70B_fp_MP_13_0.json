            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a conditional statement with the premise \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and the premise \"The car was red\". We need to determine if we can infer the conclusion \"The truck was blue\" from these premises.\n\nWhen we have a conditional statement, we can infer the conclusion if the premise is true. In this case, the premise \"The car was red\" is true, so we need to check if the conclusion \"The truck was blue\" logically follows from the premise.\n\nThe conditional statement implies that if the car was red, then the truck must be blue. Since the car was red, we can infer that the truck is blue.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
