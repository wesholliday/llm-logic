            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information consists of two parts:\n\n1. \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" - This is a conditional statement, where the truth of the conclusion (Jen watched basketball) is dependent on the premise (Tom watched football).\n2. \"Tom watched football\" - This is a statement of fact, indicating that the premise of the conditional statement is true.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"Jen watched basketball,\" we need to evaluate the validity of the argument by considering the relationship between the premises and conclusion.\n\nThe argument form is Modus Ponens, which is a valid form of argumentation. Modus Ponens states that if a conditional statement is true, and the premise is true, then the conclusion must be true. In this case, the conditional statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball,\" and the premise is \"Tom watched football.\" Since the premise is true, we can infer the conclusion, \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
