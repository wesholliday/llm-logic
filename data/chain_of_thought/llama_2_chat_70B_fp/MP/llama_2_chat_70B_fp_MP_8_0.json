            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The mummy was awake\" from the given premises, we need to evaluate the validity of the argument. The argument is structured as a modus ponens, with the premises \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" and \"The vampire was awake.\"\n\nThe modus ponens is a valid logical form, which means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. In this case, the first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. The second premise asserts that the vampire was indeed awake. Therefore, we can logically deduce that the mummy was awake.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
