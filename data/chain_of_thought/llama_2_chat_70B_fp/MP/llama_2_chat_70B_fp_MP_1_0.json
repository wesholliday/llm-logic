To determine if we can infer \"Sue was at the wedding\", we need to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe argument is valid if the premises are true and the conclusion logically follows from them. In this case, the premises are \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Mary was at the wedding\". If both premises are true, then the conclusion \"Sue was at the wedding\" logically follows.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"Sue was at the wedding\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
