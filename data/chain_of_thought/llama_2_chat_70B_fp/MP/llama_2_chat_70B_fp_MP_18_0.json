            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is a conditional statement with the premise \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" and the conclusion \"The truck was metal\". The premise is a hypothetical statement that asserts the relationship between the doll's material and the truck's material. The conclusion is the main statement that we want to infer.\n\nThe given information is \"The doll was plastic\". This information is the antecedent of the conditional statement, which means that it is the \"if\" part of the statement.\n\nTo infer the conclusion, we need to evaluate the truth of the premise based on the given information. Since the premise is a conditional statement, we can use the following rule of inference:\n\nModus Ponens:\n\n1. If A, then B\n2. A\n3. Therefore, B\n\nIn this case, A is \"the doll was plastic\" and B is \"the truck was metal\".\n\nSo, we can apply Modus Ponens to infer the conclusion:\n\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\n2. The doll was plastic (given information)\n3. Therefore, the truck was metal\n\nAnswer: Yes",
