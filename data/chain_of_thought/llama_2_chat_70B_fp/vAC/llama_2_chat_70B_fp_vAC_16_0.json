            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a form of modus ponens, which is a valid logical argument. Modus ponens is a form of argument that has the following structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Q\n3. Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, the argument has the following premises and conclusion:\n\n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\n2. The pants were denim\n3. Therefore, the shirt was cotton\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, we need to see if the conclusion is necessarily true if the premises are true.\n\nThe first premise states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. This means that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants being denim is a necessary condition. The second premise states that the pants were denim, which means that the necessary condition for the shirt being cotton has been met. Therefore, the conclusion that the shirt was cotton logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
