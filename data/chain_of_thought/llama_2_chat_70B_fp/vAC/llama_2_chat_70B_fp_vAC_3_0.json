            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a type of deductive argument, specifically a modus ponens argument. The first premise states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. The second premise states that the book is a mystery novel. The conclusion is that the book was written by James.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, is it necessarily true that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true?\n\nLet's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n2. The book is a mystery novel.\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. The second premise states that the book is a mystery novel. Therefore, we can conclude that the book was written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes. The argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises.",
