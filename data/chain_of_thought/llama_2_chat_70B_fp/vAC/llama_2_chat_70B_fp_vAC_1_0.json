            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a form of modus ponens, which is a valid logical argument. Modus ponens is a rule of inference that allows us to deduce a conclusion from two premises, where the first premise is a conditional statement and the second premise is the antecedent of the conditional statement.\n\nThe first premise of the argument is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and the consequent is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe second premise is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This premise is the antecedent of the conditional statement in the first premise.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"Mary was at the wedding.\" This conclusion follows logically from the two premises using modus ponens.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, as it follows the rules of modus ponens.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
