            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, we need to check whether the conclusion is necessarily true if the premises are true.\n\nThe first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This means that the vampire's awakeness is sufficient to guarantee the mummy's awakeness.\n\nThe second premise states that the mummy was awake. This means that the mummy's awakeness is a fact, regardless of the vampire's state.\n\nThe conclusion states that the vampire was awake. This is where we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nIf the mummy was awake (second premise), and the vampire's awakeness is sufficient to guarantee the mummy's awakeness (first premise), then it logically follows that the vampire was awake. In other words, if the mummy was awake, then the vampire must have been awake, given the first premise.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
