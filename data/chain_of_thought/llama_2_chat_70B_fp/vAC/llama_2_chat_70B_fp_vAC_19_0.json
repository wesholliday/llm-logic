            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the first premise stating a conditional relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball. The second premise states that Jen did indeed watch basketball. The conclusion drawn from these premises is that Tom watched football.\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, is it necessarily true that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true?\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. If Tom did not watch football, then according to the first premise, Jen did not watch basketball. But the second premise states that Jen did watch basketball, so this scenario is impossible.\n2. If Tom watched football, then according to the first premise, Jen watched basketball. This scenario is consistent with both premises.\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises in both possible scenarios, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
