            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a deductive argument, meaning that it aims to establish its conclusion with absolute certainty. The argument consists of three parts:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n2. The banana was yellow.\n3. Therefore, the apple was red.\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to assess whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, we need to ask whether it is impossible for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true.\n\nLet's assume that the second premise is true, that the banana was indeed yellow. If the first premise is also true, then we have a conditional statement with a true antecedent (the apple was red) and a true consequent (the banana was yellow). According to the rules of logic, a conditional statement with a true antecedent and a true consequent is itself true.\n\nTherefore, if the first premise is true, then the conclusion (the apple was red) logically follows. Since the second premise is also true, we have a valid argument.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
