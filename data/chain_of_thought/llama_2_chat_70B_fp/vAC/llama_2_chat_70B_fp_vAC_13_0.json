            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its structure and see if it follows a valid pattern. The argument has three parts:\n\n1. If the car was red, then the truck was blue. (premise 1)\n2. The truck was blue. (premise 2)\n3. The car was red. (conclusion)\n\nThe argument is structured as a modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus ponens is a rule of inference that allows us to deduce the conclusion from the premises by using the following pattern:\n\n1. If A, then B.\n2. B.\n3. Therefore, A.\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the same pattern:\n\n1. If the car was red, then the truck was blue. (premise 1)\n2. The truck was blue. (premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the car was red. (conclusion)\n\nSince the argument follows a valid pattern and the premises are true, the conclusion logically follows, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
