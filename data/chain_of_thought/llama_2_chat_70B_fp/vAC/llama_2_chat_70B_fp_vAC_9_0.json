            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a form of modus ponens, which is a valid logical argument. Modus ponens is a rule of inference that allows us to deduce a conclusion from two premises, where the first premise is a conditional statement and the second premise is the consequent of the conditional statement. In this case, the first premise is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt,\" which is a conditional statement. The second premise is \"Mark bought the blue shirt,\" which is the consequent of the conditional statement. The conclusion of the argument is \"Lisa bought the red shirt,\" which logically follows from the two premises.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n2. Identify the consequent of the conditional statement: \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n3. Identify the conclusion: \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\"\n4. Check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises: Since the first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt, and the second premise states that Mark bought the blue shirt, it logically follows that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
