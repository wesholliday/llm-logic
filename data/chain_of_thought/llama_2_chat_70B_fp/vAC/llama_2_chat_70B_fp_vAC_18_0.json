            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a modus ponens argument, which has the following form:\n\nIf A, then B\nB\nTherefore, A\n\nIn this case, the argument can be represented as:\n\nIf the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\nThe truck was metal\nTherefore, the doll was plastic\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, we need to see if the conclusion is necessarily true if the premises are true.\n\nThe first premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This means that if the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\n\nThe second premise states that the truck was metal. This means that the truck was not not metal, which is the same as saying that the truck was metal.\n\nNow, let's assume that both premises are true. If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal (from the first premise). But the truck was metal (from the second premise), which means that the doll was not plastic.\n\nTherefore, if both premises are true, then the conclusion logically follows, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
