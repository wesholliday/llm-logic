            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement. It implies that the banana's color is dependent on the apple's color. If the apple is not red, then the banana's color is not determined by the apple's color.\n\nThe statement \"The apple was not red\" tells us that the apple does not have the color red. Therefore, the condition in the first statement \"If the apple was red\" is not met, and we cannot conclude anything about the banana's color based on the apple's color.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the banana was not yellow. The statement \"The apple was not red\" only tells us that the apple does not have the color red, but it does not provide any information about the banana's color. The banana could still have any color, including yellow.",
