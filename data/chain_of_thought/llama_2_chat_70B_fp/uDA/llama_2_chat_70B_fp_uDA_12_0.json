This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part of the statement is true, then the second part must also be true.\n2. Joe did not go to the park. This statement is a negation of the first part of the conditional statement.\n3. If the first part of the conditional statement is false, then the second part must also be false. This is a logical rule, known as modus tollens.\n4. Therefore, since Joe did not go to the park, we can infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: No.",
