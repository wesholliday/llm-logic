This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest.\n2. The griffin was not in the forest. This statement is saying that the griffin is not located in the forest.\n\nNow, let's think about how these two statements relate to each other. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn would also be in the forest, according to the first statement. But, since the griffin is not in the forest, we can conclude that the unicorn is not in the forest either.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
