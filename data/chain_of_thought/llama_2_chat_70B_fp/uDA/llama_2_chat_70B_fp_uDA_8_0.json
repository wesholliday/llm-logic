            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" implies that the vampire's awakeness is a sufficient condition for the mummy's awakeness. In other words, if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must be awake.\n\nThe statement \"The vampire was not awake\" implies that the vampire is not awake.\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer that the mummy is not awake. Modus tollens is a logical rule that allows us to deduce the negation of the consequent (in this case, the mummy's awakeness) given the negation of the antecedent (the vampire's awakeness) and the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the mummy was not awake.\n\nAnswer: No",
