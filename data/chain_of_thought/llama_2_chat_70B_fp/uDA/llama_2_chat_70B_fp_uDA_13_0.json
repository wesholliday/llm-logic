            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement. It implies that the truck's color is dependent on the car's color. If the car is not red, then the truck's color is not determined by the car's color.\n\nThe statement \"The car was not red\" means that the car does not have the color red.\n\nFrom the two statements, we can infer that the truck's color is not determined by the car's color, since the car is not red. Therefore, we cannot infer that the truck was not blue. The truck's color is independent of the car's color, and we need more information to determine the truck's color.\n\nAnswer: No",
