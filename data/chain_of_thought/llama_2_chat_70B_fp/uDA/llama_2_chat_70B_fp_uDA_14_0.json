This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the bear was in the cave, then it follows that the wolf was in the den.\n2. The bear was not in the cave. This statement is saying that the bear was not in the cave, which means that the condition in step 1 is not met.\n\nNow, let's think about what we can infer from these two statements:\n\n1. If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den. This is the inverse of the first statement, and it follows logically because if the bear was not in the cave, then the condition for the wolf to be in the den is not met.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
