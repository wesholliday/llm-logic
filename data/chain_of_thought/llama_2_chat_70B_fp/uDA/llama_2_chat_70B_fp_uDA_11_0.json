This means that if the cake was chocolate, we can conclude that the muffins were blueberry.\n2. The cake was not chocolate. This means that the premise of the first statement is false, and we cannot conclude that the muffins were blueberry based on that statement alone.\n\nHowever, we have additional information that the cake was not chocolate. This means that the statement \"the muffins were blueberry\" is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the muffins were not blueberry. The statement \"the muffins were blueberry\" is still possible, even though the cake was not chocolate.",
