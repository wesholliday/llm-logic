The converse of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nTherefore, to infer the converse of the given statement, we need to negate the second clause \"the smonk plagged\" to get \"the smonk was not plagged.\" Then, we can switch the order of the clauses to get \"If the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
