It implies that the condition of the dreb being vroombed is sufficient to conclude that the dreb was spened.\n\nTo infer the negation of this statement, we need to apply the following logic:\n\n1. If the dreb was not vroombed, then it means the condition of the dreb being vroombed is not met.\n2. If the condition of the dreb being vroombed is not met, then it is possible that the dreb was not spened.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that if the dreb was not vroombed, then it is possible that the dreb was not spened.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
