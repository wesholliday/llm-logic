The converse of \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\" would be \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\"\n\nHowever, we cannot infer the converse directly from the given statement. The given statement only tells us that blumming implies zimming, but it doesn't explicitly state that zimming implies blumming. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if the flug was not zimmed, then it was not blummed.\n\nAnswer: No",
