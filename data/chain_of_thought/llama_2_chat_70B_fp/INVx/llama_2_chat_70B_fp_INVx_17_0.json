The converse of the statement would be:\n\nMovated flob \u2192 Skizzled flob\n\nHowever, this converse statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The original statement asserts that skizzling implies movating, whereas the converse statement asserts that movating implies skizzling. These are not the same thing.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the flob was not skizzled, then the flob was not movated\" directly from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
