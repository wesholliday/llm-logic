The conditional statement implies that the sploffing of the grommet (the if-clause) is sufficient to conclude that the grommet plopped the frink (the then-clause).\n\nTo infer the negation of the then-clause, we need to negate the if-clause. In other words, we need to assume that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nIf the grommet was not sploffed, then the if-clause of the original statement is false. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the grommet plopped the frink. In other words, the negation of the then-clause is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
