The antecedent (if-clause) is \"the fribble was snurgled,\" and the consequent (then-clause) is \"the fribble crinked.\"\n\nTo infer the converse of this statement, we need to switch the antecedent and consequent and negate the antecedent. The converse of \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\" would be \"If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
