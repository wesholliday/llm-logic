To infer the converse of this statement, we need to switch the antecedent and consequent and negate the antecedent.\n\nThe converse of the statement would be:\n\n\"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged\"\n\nTo negate the antecedent, we would change \"was not tragged\" to \"was tragged\"\n\nSo, the negated converse would be:\n\n\"If the glip was tragged, then the glip was slogged\"\n\nThis is the same as the original statement, but with the antecedent and consequent switched and negated. Therefore, we can infer the converse of the statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
