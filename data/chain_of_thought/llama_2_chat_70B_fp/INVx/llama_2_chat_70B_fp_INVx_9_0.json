To infer the negation of this statement, we need to switch the condition and the conclusion.\n\nThe negation of \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\" would be \"If the twonk was not varnished, then it was not plinked\". This is because if the conclusion \"it was varnished\" is negated to \"it was not varnished\", then the condition \"the twonk was plinked\" must also be negated to \"the twonk was not plinked\".\n\nTherefore, the negation of the given statement is \"If the twonk was not varnished, then it was not plinked\".\n\nAnswer: No.",
