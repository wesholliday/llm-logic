            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement, \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\" It asserts that if the flugel was blimmed, then it was zargled. However, it does not explicitly state that if the flugel was not blimmed, then it was not zargled.\n\nTo infer the latter statement, we need to use the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive of a statement is obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion and negating both parts. In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled\" would be \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nTherefore, to answer the question, we need to negate the conclusion of the given statement, which is \"the flugel was zargled,\" and switch it with the hypothesis, which is \"the flugel was blimmed.\" This gives us the contrapositive statement: \"If the flugel was not blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
