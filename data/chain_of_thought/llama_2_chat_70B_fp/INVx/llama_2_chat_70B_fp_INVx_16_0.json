To infer the negation of the conclusion, we need to negate the premise.\n\nThe negation of \"the sneg was crampled\" is \"the sneg was not crampled\".\n\nTherefore, the negation of the conclusion \"the sneg sproted the frink\" is \"the sneg did not sprot the frink\".\n\nSo, we can infer \"If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
