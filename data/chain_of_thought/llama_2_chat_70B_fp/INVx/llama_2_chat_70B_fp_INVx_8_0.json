The antecedent of the statement is \"the sprocket was cranked,\" and the consequent is \"the sprocket was daggled.\"\n\nTo infer the converse of this statement, we need to switch the antecedent and consequent and negate the consequent. The converse of the statement would be \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nHowever, we cannot infer the converse directly from the given statement because the statement only tells us that cranking the sprocket leads to daggling, but it doesn't explicitly state that daggling is impossible without cranking. In other words, there could be other ways for the sprocket to become daggled, even if it was not cranked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled\" directly from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
