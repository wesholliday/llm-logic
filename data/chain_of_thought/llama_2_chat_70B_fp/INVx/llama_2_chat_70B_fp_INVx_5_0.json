In this case, it seems that A (fraggled) and B (smoogled) are related in a way that if A is true, then B must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the converse of the statement, which is \"If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled.\" This is because if A (fraggled) is false, then B (smoogled) must also be false.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
