To infer the converse of this statement, we need to switch the condition and the consequence.\n\nThe converse of a conditional statement is formed by switching the condition and the consequence, and it is denoted by \"contrapositive\" in logic. In this case, the converse of \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" would be \"If the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged.\"\n\nTherefore, to answer the question, we need to determine if the converse of the given statement is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
