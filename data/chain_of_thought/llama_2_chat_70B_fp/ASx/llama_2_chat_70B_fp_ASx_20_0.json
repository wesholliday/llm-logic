The fact that the drazzle is drooped does not change whether or not the plim is grobbled, and it does not change whether or not the whiffle will sploosh.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the plim is grobbled and the drazzle is drooped, then the whiffle will still sploosh, because the grobbled plim is sufficient to cause the splooshing of the whiffle, regardless of the state of the drazzle.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
