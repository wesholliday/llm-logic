In other words, if the zonk is twiddled and blorped, then it will pluzzle, because if the zonk is twiddled, it will pluzzle, and if it is blorped, it will also pluzzle.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the zonk is twiddled and it is blorped, then it will pluzzle\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
