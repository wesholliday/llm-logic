            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement, \"If the trankle is sploofed, then the zorple will quibble.\" It means that whenever the trankle is sploofed, the zorple will quibble.\n\nNow, let's consider the proposed inference: \"If the trankle is sploofed and the drib is flanked, then the zorple will quibble.\" This statement is a conjunction of two conditionals: \"If the trankle is sploofed\" and \"If the drib is flanked.\"\n\nWhen we concatenate two conditionals using \"and,\" the resulting statement is true only if both conditionals are true. In other words, the conclusion follows if and only if both premises are true.\n\nTherefore, to determine whether the proposed inference is valid, we need to check if the truth of the second conditional (\"If the drib is flanked, then the zorple will quibble\") follows from the truth of the first conditional (\"If the trankle is sploofed, then the zorple will quibble\").\n\nIf the trankle is sploofed, then the zorple will quibble, by the first conditional.\nIf the drib is flanked, then the zorple will quibble, by the second conditional.\n\nNow, let's assume that the trankle is sploofed and the drib is flanked. Using the first conditional, we know that the zorple will quibble because the trankle is sploofed. Using the second conditional, we also know that the zorple will quibble because the drib is flanked.\n\nSince the zorple will quibble in this scenario, the proposed inference \"If the trankle is sploofed and the drib is flanked, then the zorple will quibble\" is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
