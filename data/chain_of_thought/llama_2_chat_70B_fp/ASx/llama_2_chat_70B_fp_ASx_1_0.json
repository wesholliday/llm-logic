            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement \"If the snark was blimmed, then it flooped\" implies that bliming is a sufficient condition for flooping. In other words, if the snark was blimmed, then it must have flooped.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"If the snark was blimmed and sproinged, then it flooped.\" This statement adds the condition of sproinging to the original statement. In other words, it suggests that if the snark was both blimmed and sproinged, then it must have flooped.\n\nSince sproinging is a separate condition from bliming, it does not affect the sufficiency of bliming for flooping. In other words, even if the snark was sproinged, it still needs to be blimed in order to flop. Therefore, we can infer that if the snark was blimmed and sproinged, then it flooped.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
