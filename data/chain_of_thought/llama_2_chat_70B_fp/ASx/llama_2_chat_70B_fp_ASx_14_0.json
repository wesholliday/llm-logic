If the frizzle is dinked, it does not necessarily mean that the sklonk is grooped, and vice versa. In other words, the condition \"the frizzle is dinked\" does not provide enough information to determine the state of the sklonk.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the given statement. The additional information about the sklonk being grooped does not provide any further insight into the relationship between the frizzle and zarp.\n\nAnswer: No",
