            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement, \"If the tizzer is on, then the goom is snurpled.\" It means that whenever the tizzer is on, the goom is necessarily snurpled.\n\nNow, let's consider the proposed inference: \"If the tizzer is on and the plink light is out, then the goom is snurpled.\" This statement is also a conditional statement, but it includes an additional premise, \"the plink light is out.\"\n\nTo determine whether we can infer the proposed statement from the given statement, we need to evaluate whether the additional premise provides any new information that would change the conclusion. In other words, we need to check whether the plink light being out provides any insight into whether the goom is snurpled, beyond what we already know from the tizzer being on.\n\nIt appears that the plink light being out does not provide any new information about the goom's snurpledness. The tizzer being on already implies that the goom is snurpled, so the plink light being out does not change that conclusion. In other words, even if the plink light were out, we would still conclude that the goom is snurpled, based on the tizzer being on.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the proposed statement from the given statement, and the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
