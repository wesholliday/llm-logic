The fact that the snarp is flooping does not necessarily imply that the fribble is flugged. The fribble could still be in the snarp even if the snarp is not flooping.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the fribble is in the snarp and the snarp is flooping, then it is flugged\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
