            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, we need to see if the conclusion is necessarily true if the premises are true.\n\nThe first premise states that the book is either on the shelf or resting on the table. This means that there are only two possible options for the location of the book: it is either on the shelf or resting on the table.\n\nThe second premise states that the book isn't resting on the table. This means that the book is not in the second possible location, which means it must be in the first possible location, i.e., on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can logically conclude that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
