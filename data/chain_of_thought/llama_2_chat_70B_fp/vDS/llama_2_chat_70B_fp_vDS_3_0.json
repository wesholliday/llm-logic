The argument follows the form of a disjunctive syllogism, which has the following structure:\n\nEither A or B\nNot B\nTherefore, A\n\nIn this case, the argument's first premise is \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet.\" This premise presents two exclusive options, indicating that the keys can only be in one of these two locations.\n\nThe second premise is \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet.\" This premise eliminates one of the options presented in the first premise, leaving only the option that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"The keys are in the drawer.\" This conclusion logically follows from the first two premises, as the only remaining option for the keys' location is the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid.",
