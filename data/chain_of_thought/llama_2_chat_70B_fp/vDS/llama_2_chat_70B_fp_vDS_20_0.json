            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a form of disjunctive syllogism, which has the following form:\n\nEither A or B\nNot B\nTherefore, A\n\nIn this case, the argument is:\n\nEither the sunglasses are in her bag or they are perched on her head\nThe sunglasses aren't perched on her head\nTherefore, the sunglasses are in her bag\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, we need to see if the conclusion is necessarily true if the premises are true.\n\nThe first premise presents two exclusive options, which means that if one option is true, the other must be false. The second premise states that the second option (the sunglasses are perched on her head) is false. Therefore, the first option (the sunglasses are in her bag) must be true.\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
