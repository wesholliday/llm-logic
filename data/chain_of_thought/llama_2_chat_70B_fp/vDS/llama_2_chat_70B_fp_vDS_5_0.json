The argument follows the form of a disjunctive syllogism, which has the following structure:\n\nEither A or B\nNot B\nTherefore, A\n\nIn this case, the argument's first premise is \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry.\" This premise presents two exclusive options, meaning that if one option is true, the other must be false. The second premise is \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry.\" This premise negates the second option, leaving the first option as the only possibility. The conclusion of the argument is \"The cookies are in the jar,\" which logically follows from the first premise and the negation of the second premise.\n\nSince the argument follows the valid form of a disjunctive syllogism and its premises are true, the conclusion necessarily follows, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
