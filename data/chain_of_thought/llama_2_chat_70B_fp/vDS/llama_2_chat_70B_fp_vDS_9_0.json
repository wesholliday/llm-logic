The second premise negates one of those options, stating that the puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor. Therefore, by process of elimination, the only remaining option is that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
