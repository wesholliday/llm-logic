However, the second statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\" is still true, because James wrote the book and it is indeed a mystery novel.\n\nScenario 2: The book is not a mystery novel.\nIn this scenario, the first statement \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel\" is true, because the book is not a mystery novel. However, the second statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\" is false, because James did not write the book and it is not a mystery novel.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that the given statements are consistent with each other, and we cannot infer \"The book was not written by James\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
