            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nLet's break down the given information:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" means that Mark did not necessarily buy the blue shirt. In other words, there is no guarantee that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n2. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" means that if Lisa did buy the red shirt, then Mark was forced to buy the blue shirt. In other words, if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark had no choice but to buy the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Lisa bought the red shirt.\nIn this scenario, since Lisa bought the red shirt, Mark must have bought the blue shirt (according to the second premise). Therefore, in this scenario, Mark did buy the blue shirt.\n\nScenario 2: Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\nIn this scenario, since Lisa did not buy the red shirt, Mark was not forced to buy the blue shirt (according to the second premise). Therefore, in this scenario, Mark might or might not have bought the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\"?\n\nWe can see that in Scenario 1, Lisa did buy the red shirt, and in Scenario 2, Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Therefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
