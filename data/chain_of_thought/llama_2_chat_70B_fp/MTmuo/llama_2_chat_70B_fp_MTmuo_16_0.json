However, this contradicts the first statement, which states that the pants could have been made of any material other than denim. Therefore, this scenario is impossible.\n\nScenario 2: The shirt was not cotton.\nIn this scenario, the pants could have been made of any material, including denim. This scenario is consistent with both statements, as the first statement allows for the pants to be made of any material, and the second statement does not apply since the shirt was not cotton.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
