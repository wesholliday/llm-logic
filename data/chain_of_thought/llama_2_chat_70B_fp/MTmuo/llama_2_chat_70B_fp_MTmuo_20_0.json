It could be any color except yellow.\n2. \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" implies that if the apple was red, then the banana's color must have been yellow.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible cases:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then according to the second premise, the banana must have been yellow.\n2. If the apple was not red, then the banana's color is not necessarily yellow, as per the first premise.\n\nIn both cases, we cannot conclusively infer the color of the apple. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The apple was not red\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
