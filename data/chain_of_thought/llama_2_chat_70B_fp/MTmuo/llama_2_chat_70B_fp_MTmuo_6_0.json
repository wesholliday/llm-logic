If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta (according to the second statement).\n2. If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob's choice was not determined, and he could have chosen either pasta or pizza.\n\nGiven that \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta,\" we can conclude that Sue did not choose pizza, because if she had, Bob's choice would have been determined to be pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
