            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nLet's break down the information given in the question:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train\" means that Erin could have taken a train, but it's not necessarily the case that she did. In other words, Erin's mode of transportation is not determined.\n2. \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train\" means that if Sam took a plane, then Erin's mode of transportation is determined to be a train. In other words, if Sam took a plane, then Erin cannot have taken a plane, and must have taken a train instead.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Sam took a plane.\nIn this scenario, Erin must have taken a train, since Sam took a plane and the statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train\" is true.\n\nScenario 2: Sam did not take a plane.\nIn this scenario, Erin's mode of transportation is not determined, since the statement \"It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train\" is true.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can see that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train, but if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin's mode of transportation is not determined. Therefore, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
