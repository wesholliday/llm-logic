But this contradicts the first premise, which states that Lucy's going to the zoo is not necessarily true. Therefore, this scenario is impossible.\n\nScenario 2: Joe did not go to the park.\nIn this scenario, Lucy's going to the zoo is not necessarily true, since the second premise does not apply. This aligns with the first premise.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
