            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nLet's break down the given information:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding\" means that Sue's attendance at the wedding is not necessarily true. In other words, Sue might or might not have been at the wedding.\n2. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" means that if Mary was present at the wedding, then Sue's presence at the wedding is necessary. In other words, if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must also have been at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Mary was at the wedding.\nIn this scenario, Sue must have been at the wedding too, according to the second premise. Therefore, Sue's attendance at the wedding is confirmed.\n\nScenario 2: Mary was not at the wedding.\nIn this scenario, the first premise states that Sue's attendance at the wedding is not necessarily true. Therefore, Sue might or might not have been at the wedding.\n\nSince we have two possible scenarios, and in one of them (Scenario 2), Sue's attendance at the wedding is uncertain, we cannot infer with certainty that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No.",
