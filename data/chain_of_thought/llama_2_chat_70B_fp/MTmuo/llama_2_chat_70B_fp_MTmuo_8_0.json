If the vampire was awake, then by the second premise, the mummy must have been awake.\n2. If the vampire was not awake, then by the first premise, the mummy's awakeness is not necessarily true.\n\nIn either case, we cannot conclude that the vampire was not awake. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The vampire was not awake\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
