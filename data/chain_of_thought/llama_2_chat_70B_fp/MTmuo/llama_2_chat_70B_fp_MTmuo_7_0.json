However, the second statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race\" is true, because Chris did finish the race.\n\nScenario 2: Chris did not finish the race.\nIn this scenario, the first statement \"It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race\" is true, because Chris did not finish the race. However, the second statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race\" is false, because Chris did not finish the race.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that the given statements are consistent with both scenarios, and we cannot infer anything about Alex's participation in the race.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'Alex did not finish the race' from the given statements.",
