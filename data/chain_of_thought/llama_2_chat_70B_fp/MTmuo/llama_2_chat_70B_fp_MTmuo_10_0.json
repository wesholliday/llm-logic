In other words, there's a possibility that the cat was inside.\n2. \"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside\" means that if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside. This is a conditional statement, and its inverse is also true: if the cat was not outside, then the dog must not have been inside.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer \"The dog was not inside\" from the given information?\n\nWe know that the cat's being outside is not necessarily true. If the cat was inside, then the dog must not have been inside, according to the second statement. Therefore, we can infer that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
