However, the statement \"it's not the case that\" negates this idea, implying that it is possible for the griffin to have been somewhere else.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"the griffin might not have been in the forest\" because the statement \"it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\" implies that it is possible for the griffin to have been somewhere else.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
