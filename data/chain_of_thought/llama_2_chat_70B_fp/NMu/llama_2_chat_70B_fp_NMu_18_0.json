The phrase \"must be in the drawer\" implies that the notebook being in the drawer is a necessary condition, meaning that if the notebook is not in the drawer, then it is not fulfilling its necessary condition.\n\nTherefore, by negating the statement, we can infer that the notebook might not be in the drawer. This is because the statement is saying that the notebook not being in the drawer is a possibility, which means that it might not be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
