In other words, the statement is saying that it is not necessary or required for Sue to have chosen pizza.\n\nHowever, this statement does not directly imply that Sue might not have chosen pizza. It only means that it is not a certainty that Sue chose pizza. There is still a possibility that Sue chose pizza, but it is not a requirement or a necessity.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" directly from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
