By saying \"it's not the case that,\" we are negating the necessity of this scenario, meaning that it's possible that the book was not written by James.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"the book might not have been written by James\" because the statement \"it's not the case that the book must have been written by James\" implies that it's possible that the book was written by someone else or not written at all.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
