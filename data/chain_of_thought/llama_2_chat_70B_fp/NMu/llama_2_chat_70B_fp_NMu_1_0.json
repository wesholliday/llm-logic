The second part negates this hypothesis, stating that it is not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nIn other words, the statement \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" implies that Mary's presence at the wedding is not necessary or obligatory, and that there are possible scenarios where Mary might not have been at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we can infer from this statement that Mary might not have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
