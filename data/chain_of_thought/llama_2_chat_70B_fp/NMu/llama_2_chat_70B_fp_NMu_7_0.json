            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race\" can be broken down into two parts: \"Alex must have finished the race\" and \"it's not the case that.\" The first part is a conditional statement, which implies that if Alex had finished the race, then it would be the case that Alex must have finished the race. The second part negates the first part, saying that it's not the case that Alex must have finished the race.\n\nNow, let's consider the contrapositive of the statement \"Alex must have finished the race.\" The contrapositive is \"Alex might not have finished the race.\" This statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is false, then the contrapositive must be true.\n\nTherefore, by negating the original statement, we can infer that Alex might not have finished the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
