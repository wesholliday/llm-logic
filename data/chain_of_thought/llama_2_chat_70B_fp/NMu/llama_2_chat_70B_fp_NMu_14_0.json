In other words, the milk could be somewhere else, or it might not even exist.\n\nFrom this statement, we can infer that the milk might not be on the counter, because the statement explicitly states that the milk being on the counter is not a requirement. However, we cannot infer with certainty that the milk is not on the counter, because the statement only tells us that it's not a necessary condition, not that it's an impossible condition.\n\nTherefore, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that the milk might not be on the counter.",
