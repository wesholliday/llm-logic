The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the cookies can be in one of two places: the jar or the pantry. Statement 2 tells us that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, which means they cannot be in the pantry.\n\nSince the cookies cannot be in the pantry, the only remaining option is that they are in the jar. Therefore, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
