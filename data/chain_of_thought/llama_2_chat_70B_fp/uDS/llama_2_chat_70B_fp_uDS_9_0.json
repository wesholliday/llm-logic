This means that there are only two possible locations for the missing puzzle piece: the box or the floor.\n2. The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor. This means that the missing puzzle piece is not on the floor, as it would be blending in and not easily visible.\n3. If the missing puzzle piece is not on the floor, then it must be in the box. This is because the box is the only other location where the missing puzzle piece could be.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
