The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the phone can be in one of two places: the living room or the kitchen. Statement 2 tells us that the phone isn't ringing in the kitchen, which means it's not in the kitchen.\n\nSince the phone isn't in the kitchen, the only remaining option is that it's in the living room. Therefore, we can infer that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
