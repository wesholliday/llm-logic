(This is a disjunctive statement, meaning that one or the other must be true.)\n2. The pen isn't on my desk. (This means that the second disjunct of the first statement cannot be true, so we can eliminate that option.)\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. The pen is in my bag. (This is the only remaining option, as the pen cannot be on the desk.)\n2. The pen is not in my bag. (If the pen is not in the bag, then it must be on the desk, which contradicts the given information that the pen is not on the desk.)\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the pen is indeed in my bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
