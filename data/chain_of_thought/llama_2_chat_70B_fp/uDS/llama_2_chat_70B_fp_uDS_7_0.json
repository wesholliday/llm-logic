The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the umbrella can be in one of two places: the car or the closet.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the umbrella isn't in the closet.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The umbrella is in the car.\nScenario 2: The umbrella is not in the car.\n\nIf the umbrella is not in the car (Scenario 2), then it must be in the closet, since we've been told that it's not tucked away in the closet. However, this contradicts statement 2, which says that the umbrella isn't in the closet.\n\nTherefore, the only possible scenario left is Scenario 1: The umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
