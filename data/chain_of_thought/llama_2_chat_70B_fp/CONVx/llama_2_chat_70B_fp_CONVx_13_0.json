In other words, whenever the glip is slogged, it is also tragged.\n\nTo infer the converse of this statement, we need to check if tragged is a sufficient condition for slogged. In other words, we need to see if whenever the glip is tragged, it is also slogged.\n\nUnfortunately, the given statement does not provide enough information to establish a connection between tragged and slogged. We cannot infer the converse of the statement because we do not know if tragged implies slogged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the glip was tragged, then the glip was slogged\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
