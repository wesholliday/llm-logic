The converse of the statement would be \"If the fribble crinked, then the fribble was snurgled\".\n\nHowever, we cannot infer the converse directly from the given statement because the relationship between snurgling and crinkling may not be inverse. In other words, just because the fribble crinked, it does not mean that it was snurgled. There could be other reasons why the fribble crinked, such as it being dropped or squeezed too hard.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the fribble crinked, then the fribble was snurgled\" directly from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
