The converse of the statement would be \"If the shank was nugged, then the shank was plooked\".\n\nHowever, we cannot infer the converse of the statement directly from the given statement. The given statement only tells us that if the shank was plooked, then it was nugged, but it doesn't necessarily mean that if the shank was nugged, then it was plooked.\n\nFor example, it's possible that the shank was nugged without being plooked. In this case, the converse of the statement would be false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the converse of the statement from the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: No",
