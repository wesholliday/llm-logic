In other words, we need to see if the relationship between the two conditions is reversible.\n\nHowever, the given statement does not provide enough information to establish a reversible relationship between the two conditions. It only tells us that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was spened, but it does not necessarily follow that if the dreb was spened, then it was vroombed.\n\nFor example, it's possible that the dreb was spened for a reason unrelated to being vroombed. Therefore, we cannot infer the converse of the statement without additional information.\n\nAnswer: No",
