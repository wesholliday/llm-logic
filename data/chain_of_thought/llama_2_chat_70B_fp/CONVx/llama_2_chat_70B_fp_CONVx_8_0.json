The converse of the statement would be \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was cranked\".\n\nHowever, we cannot infer the converse of the statement directly from the given statement. The given statement only tells us that when the sprocket is cranked, it is daggled, but it does not necessarily mean that when the sprocket is daggled, it was cranked. There could be other reasons why the sprocket is daggled, such as being damaged or worn out.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was cranked\" directly from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
