In other words, whenever the flugel is blimmed, it is also zargled.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer the converse of this statement, we need to examine whether zargling is a sufficient condition for blimming. In other words, if the flugel is zargled, can we conclude that it was blimmed?\n\nUnfortunately, the given statement does not provide enough information to establish a causal relationship between zargling and blimming. It only tells us that blimming implies zargling, but it does not tell us whether zargling implies blimming. Therefore, we cannot infer the converse of the statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
