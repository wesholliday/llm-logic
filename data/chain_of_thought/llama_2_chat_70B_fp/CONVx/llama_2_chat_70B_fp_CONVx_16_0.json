To infer the converse of this statement, we need to check if the consequent implies the antecedent.\n\nIn this case, the consequent \"the sneg sproted the frink\" does not necessarily imply the antecedent \"the sneg was crampled\". It's possible that the sneg sproted the frink for other reasons, such as it being hungry or wanting to play. Therefore, we cannot infer the converse of the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
