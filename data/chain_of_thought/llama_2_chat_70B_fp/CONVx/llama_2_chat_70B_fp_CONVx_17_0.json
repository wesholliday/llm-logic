The converse of the statement would be \"If the flob movated, then the flob was skizzled\".\n\nHowever, we cannot infer the converse of the statement directly from the given statement. The given statement only tells us that skizzling the flob leads to movation, but it doesn't necessarily mean that movation implies skizzling. There could be other reasons why the flob movated, without being skizzled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the flob movated, then the flob was skizzled\" directly from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
