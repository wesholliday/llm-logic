The glip is not tragged.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can deduce that the glip is either slogged or tragged. Since premise 2 states that the glip is not tragged, we can eliminate the possibility that the glip is tragged. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
