The smonk is not plagged.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can deduce that the smonk is either vreebled or plagged. Since premise 2 states that the smonk is not plagged, we can eliminate the possibility that the smonk is plagged. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
