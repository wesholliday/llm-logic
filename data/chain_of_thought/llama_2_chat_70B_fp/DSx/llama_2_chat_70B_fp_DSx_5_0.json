The zinger is not smoogled.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can deduce that the zinger is either fraggled or smoogled. Since premise 2 states that the zinger is not smoogled, we can eliminate the possibility that the zinger is smoogled. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
