    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information can be summarized as follows:\n\n* Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US.\n* Tennessee is expected to add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower.\n* If Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then Tennessee won\u2019t.\n* Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t.\n\nFrom the given information, we can conclude that Tennessee is expected to add the most jobs, and Georgia is expected to add the second-most jobs. Missouri's job growth is significantly lower than Tennessee's and Georgia's, so it is unlikely that Missouri will add the most jobs.\n\nIf Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then it is likely that Tennessee will. However, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, it is not necessarily true that Missouri will. There is a possibility that Georgia could add the most jobs in that scenario.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that it is likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will, cannot be logically deduced from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
