    "user_prompt": "Suppose that India, China, and Russia are the world's leading emerging economies. Economists project it's likely India's economy will grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind. These are by far the biggest emerging economies, so if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn\u2019t, Russia will be. Moreover, India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if India isn\u2019t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information states that India, China, and Russia are the world's leading emerging economies, and economists project that India's economy will grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind. This means that the growth rate of India's economy is likely to be higher than China's, and China's growth rate is likely to be higher than Russia's.\n\nIf China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then it means that India's economy will grow faster than China's. Therefore, if India isn't the top-growing emerging economy, it means that China's economy will grow faster than India's, which is not possible according to the given information.\n\nHence, it can be concluded that if India isn't the top-growing emerging economy, then Russia will be.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
