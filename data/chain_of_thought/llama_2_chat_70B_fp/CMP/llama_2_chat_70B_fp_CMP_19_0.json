    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don\u2019t increase the most, then if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won\u2019t increase the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information states that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year, with rents projected to increase the most, followed by home prices, and mortgage rates rising less. It also states that if home prices don\u2019t increase the most, then mortgage rates will increase the most.\n\nWe can deduce from this information that if rents increase the most, then home prices will not increase the most. Therefore, if rents do not increase the most, it means that home prices will increase more than rents.\n\nNow, if home prices increase more than rents, it does not necessarily mean that mortgage rates will increase the most. The given information only states that mortgage rates will increase less than rents and home prices. Therefore, even if home prices increase more than rents, mortgage rates may still increase less than home prices.\n\nAnswer: No, it does not follow that if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.",
