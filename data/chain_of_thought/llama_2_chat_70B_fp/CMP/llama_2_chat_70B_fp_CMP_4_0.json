    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it\u2019s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn\u2019t get the offer, then if Priya doesn\u2019t, Diego will. Moreover, it\u2019s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn\u2019t get the offer, Diego will?",

The hiring manager thinks it's most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot.\n3. If Julian doesn't get the offer, then if Priya doesn't, Diego will.\n4. It's likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won't.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the conclusion: \"It is likely that, if Priya doesn't get the offer, Diego will.\"\n\nFrom the given information, we know that if Julian doesn't get the offer, then Diego will. However, we also know that it's likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won't. This means that the probability of Julian not getting the offer is high, which in turn increases the probability of Diego getting the offer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it is indeed likely that if Priya doesn't get the offer, Diego will.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
