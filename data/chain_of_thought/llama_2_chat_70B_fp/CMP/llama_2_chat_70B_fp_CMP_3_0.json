    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Spain, Brazil, and England have the best chances to win the World Cup. Based on betting odds, it is most likely Spain will win, followed closely by Brazil, with England having much lower odds. These teams have the only realistic chances, so if Brazil doesn\u2019t win, then if Spain doesn\u2019t win, England will win. Moreover, it is likely Spain will win and hence that Brazil won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Spain doesn\u2019t win, England will?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information can be represented as follows:\n\n* Spain has the best chance to win the World Cup, followed closely by Brazil.\n* England has much lower odds than Spain and Brazil.\n* If Brazil doesn\u2019t win, then if Spain doesn\u2019t win, England will win.\n* It is likely that Spain will win, and hence that Brazil won\u2019t win.\n\nFrom the information provided, we can deduce the following:\n\n* If Spain wins, then Brazil won\u2019t win, and England won\u2019t win.\n* If Brazil doesn\u2019t win, then England will win, unless Spain wins.\n* It is likely that Spain will win, which means it is likely that Brazil won\u2019t win.\n\nNow, let\u2019s consider the possibility that Spain doesn\u2019t win. In this case, we know that Brazil won\u2019t win, since Spain has the best chance to win and Brazil is the second-most likely team to win. Therefore, if Spain doesn\u2019t win, then the only team left with a realistic chance to win is England.\n\nSo, to answer the question, it is likely that, if Spain doesn\u2019t win, England will.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
