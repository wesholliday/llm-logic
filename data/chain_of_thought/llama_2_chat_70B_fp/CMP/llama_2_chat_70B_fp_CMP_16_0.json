    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options in a city. According to ridership data, Uber likely will have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. These are the only major transportation providers, so if Lyft doesn\u2019t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. Moreover, Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won\u2019t give the most rides. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information can be summarized as follows:\n\n* Uber likely has the most rides this month.\n* Lyft has fewer rides than Uber.\n* Taxis have significantly fewer rides than Uber and Lyft.\n* Uber likely will give the most rides.\n* Lyft likely won't give the most rides.\n\nFrom the information provided, we can conclude that Uber is the dominant player in the market, followed by Lyft, and then taxis. The statement \"if Lyft doesn\u2019t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides\" can be rephrased as:\n\n* If Lyft doesn't give the most rides, then Uber must give the most rides.\n* If Uber doesn't give the most rides, then taxis must give the most rides.\n\nTherefore, we can deduce that if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will likely give the most rides.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
