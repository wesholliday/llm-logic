    "user_prompt": "Suppose that spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons. Forecasts show it's likely most vacations this year will happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with many fewer happening in the winter. These are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. Moreover, spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

It also states that if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then winter will, and that spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't.\n\nFrom this information, we can conclude that the likelihood of spring having the most vacations is high, and if it doesn't, then summer is the next most likely candidate. However, if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then winter will, according to the given information. Therefore, it is not necessarily true that if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will.\n\nAnswer: No.",
