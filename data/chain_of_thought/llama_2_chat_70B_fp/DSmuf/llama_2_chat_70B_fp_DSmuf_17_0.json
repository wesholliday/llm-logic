It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can deduce that the scarf must be either draped on the coat rack or stuffed in the backpack. Since premise 2 states that it's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack, we can conclude that the scarf is not draped on the coat rack.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can infer that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
