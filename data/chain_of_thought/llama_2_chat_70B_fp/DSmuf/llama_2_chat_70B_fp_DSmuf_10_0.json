This means that there are only two possible locations for the missing sock, and one of them must be true.\n\nThe second premise states that it's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed. This means that the possibility of the missing sock being under the bed is eliminated, leaving only one possible location for the missing sock, which is the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
