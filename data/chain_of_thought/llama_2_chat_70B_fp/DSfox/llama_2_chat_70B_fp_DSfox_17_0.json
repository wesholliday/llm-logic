Either the flob is movated or it is skizzled.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that the flob is not movated.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that there are two possibilities: either the flob is movated or it is skizzled. Since we have already established that the flob is not movated, the only remaining possibility is that the flob is skizzled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
