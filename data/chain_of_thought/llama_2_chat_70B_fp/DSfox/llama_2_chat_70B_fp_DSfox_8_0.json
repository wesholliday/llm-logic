Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that the sprocket is not daggled. Now, let's consider the possibilities based on premise 2:\n\n* If the sprocket is daggled, then it cannot be cranked (since daggled and cranked are mutually exclusive).\n* If the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked (since the only other option is that it is daggled, which we have already ruled out).\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
