It is a disjunction, meaning that one of the two clauses must be true. The first clause is \"the grommet is plopped,\" which we know is not true based on the first statement. Therefore, the second clause \"it is sploffed\" must be true.\n\nSo, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
