Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that the splat is not quanked.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that there are two possibilities: either the splat is quanked or it is morphed.\n\nSince we have already established that the splat is not quanked (premise 1), the only remaining possibility is that the splat is morphed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
