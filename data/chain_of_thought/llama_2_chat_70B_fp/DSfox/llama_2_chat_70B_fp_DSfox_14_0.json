Either the clug is snugged or it is fleeked\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that the clug is not snugged.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that there are two possibilities: either the clug is snugged or it is fleeked.\n\nSince we have already established that the clug is not snugged (premise 1), the only remaining possibility is that the clug is fleeked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
