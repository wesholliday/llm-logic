The splat is quanked: In this case, the first statement is true, and the second statement is false.\n2. The splat is not quanked: In this case, the first statement is false, and the second statement is true.\n3. The splat is morphed: In this case, the first statement is true, and the second statement is true.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can see that the combination of the two statements does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the splat is morphed. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The splat is morphed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
