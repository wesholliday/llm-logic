If the clug is not snugged, then it must be fleeked.\n\nThe sentence \"The clug might not be snugged\" implies that the clug's state is not necessarily snugged. Since the clug might not be snugged, it is possible that it is fleeked.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can infer that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
