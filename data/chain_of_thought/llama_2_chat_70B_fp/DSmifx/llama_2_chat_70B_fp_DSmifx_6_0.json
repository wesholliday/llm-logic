The sentence \"The grommet might not be plopped\" implies that the grommet is not necessarily in the state of being plopped.\n\nIf the grommet is not plopped, then it must be in the state of being sploffed, since these are the only two possible states according to the first premise. Therefore, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
