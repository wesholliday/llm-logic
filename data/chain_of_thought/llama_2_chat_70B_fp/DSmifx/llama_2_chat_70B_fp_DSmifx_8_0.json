The second premise \"The sprocket might not be daggled\" implies that the sprocket may or may not be daggled, but it does not necessarily mean that it is cranked.\n\nHowever, if we combine the two premises, we can deduce that if the sprocket is not daggled, then it must be cranked. This is because the first premise states that the sprocket must be either daggled or cranked, and the second premise suggests that it is not daggled. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
