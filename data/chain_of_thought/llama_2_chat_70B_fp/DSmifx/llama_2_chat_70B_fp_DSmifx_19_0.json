The sentence \"The smonk might not be plagged\" implies that the smonk may not be in the state of being plagged.\n\nIf the smonk is not plagged, then it must be in the state of being vreebled, since these are the only two possible states according to the first premise. Therefore, we can infer that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
