It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\n\nFrom the first part, we can deduce that the book must be either on the shelf or on the table. Since the second part states that it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table, we can infer that the book is not on the table. Therefore, the only possible location for the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
