It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen.\n\nFrom the first part, we can deduce that the phone is either in the living room or in the kitchen. Since the second part states that it's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen, we can infer that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen. Therefore, the only possible location for the phone is the living room.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
