It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nFrom 1, we know that the notebook has to be in one of two places: the drawer or the nightstand. From 2, we know that it's not the case that the notebook must be on the nightstand, which means it's possible that it's on the nightstand, but it's not a necessity.\n\nNow, let's consider the negation of the conclusion we want to draw: \"The notebook is in the drawer.\" If we negate this statement, we get: \"The notebook is not in the drawer.\"\n\nIf the notebook is not in the drawer, then it must be on the nightstand, since it's not in the drawer and it's not a necessity that it's on the nightstand. But this contradicts our second premise, which states that it's not the case that the notebook must be on the nightstand.\n\nTherefore, our initial statement \"The notebook is in the drawer\" must be true, and we can infer that the notebook is indeed in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
