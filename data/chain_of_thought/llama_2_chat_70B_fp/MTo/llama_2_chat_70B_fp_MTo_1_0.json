            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. \"Sue was not at the wedding\" - This statement tells us that Sue did not attend the wedding.\n2. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" - This statement is a conditional statement that implies that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue must have also attended the wedding.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Mary was at the wedding\nIn this scenario, we know that Sue was not at the wedding (from the first statement). Therefore, the conditional statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" becomes false. This means that we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nScenario 2: Mary was not at the wedding\nIn this scenario, the conditional statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" becomes true, as Sue was not at the wedding (from the first statement). However, this scenario does not help us infer whether Mary was at the wedding or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
