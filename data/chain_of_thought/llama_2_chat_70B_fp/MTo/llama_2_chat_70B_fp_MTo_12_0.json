It means that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's think about how we can use these two pieces of information to infer whether Joe went to the park or not.\n\nIf Joe went to the park, then according to the second statement, Lucy went to the zoo. But we know that Lucy did not go to the zoo, so the condition in the second statement cannot be true. Therefore, we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
