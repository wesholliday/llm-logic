            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'The griffin was not in the forest' from the given statements, we need to evaluate the relationship between the unicorn and the griffin in the context of the forest.\n\nThe first statement 'The unicorn was not in the forest' implies that the unicorn was not present in the forest.\n\nThe second statement 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest' implies that if the griffin was present in the forest, then the unicorn must also be present in the forest. This statement does not directly mention the griffin's presence or absence in the forest.\n\nBy combining these two statements, we can deduce that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must be in the forest as well, since the griffin's presence implies the unicorn's presence. However, since the unicorn was not in the forest, it means that the griffin cannot be in the forest either, as its presence would contradict the fact that the unicorn was not there.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The griffin was not in the forest' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
