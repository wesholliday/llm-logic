If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n\nFrom 1, we know that the mummy was not awake.\n\nFrom 2, we know that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy would also be awake.\n\nNow, let's consider two possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The vampire was awake.\nIn this scenario, the mummy would also be awake, according to the second premise. However, this contradicts the first premise, which states that the mummy was not awake.\n\nScenario 2: The vampire was not awake.\nIn this scenario, the mummy would not be awake either, since the vampire was not awake. This is consistent with the first premise.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
