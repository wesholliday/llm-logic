            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" - This statement tells us that Mark did not purchase the blue shirt.\n2. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" - This statement is a conditional statement that implies a cause-and-effect relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. In other words, if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility of Lisa not buying the red shirt:\n\n1. If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then the condition in the second statement is not met, and the conclusion that Mark bought the blue shirt does not follow.\n2. Therefore, if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then we cannot infer that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt from the given statements.",
