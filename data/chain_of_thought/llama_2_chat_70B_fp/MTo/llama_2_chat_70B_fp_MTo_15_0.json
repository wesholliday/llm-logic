In other words, if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility of Sam taking a plane:\n\n1. If Sam took a plane, then according to the conditional statement, Erin must have taken a train.\n2. However, we know that Erin did not take a train, which means that the condition in step 1 cannot be true.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
