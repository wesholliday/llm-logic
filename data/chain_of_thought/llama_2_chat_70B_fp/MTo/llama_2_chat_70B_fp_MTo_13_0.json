If the car was red, then the truck was blue\n\nFrom 1, we know that the truck was not blue.\n\nFrom 2, we know that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. This means that if the car was red, then the truck cannot be blue (since it's not blue).\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the car was red. If the car was red, then according to 2, the truck would have to be blue. But we know from 1 that the truck was not blue. This means that the car cannot be red, since if it were red, then the truck would have to be blue, which contradicts our knowledge that the truck was not blue.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
