If Tom did not watch football, then according to the conditional statement, Jen watched basketball.\n2. However, we know that Jen did not watch basketball.\n3. Therefore, the conditional statement ~F \u2192 B is false.\n4. Since the conditional statement is false, we can conclude that Tom did watch football.\n\nAnswer:\nYes.",
