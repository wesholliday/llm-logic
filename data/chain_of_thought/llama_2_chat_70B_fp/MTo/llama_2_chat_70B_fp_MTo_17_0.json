However, we know that Kate did not eat the salad, which means the conditional statement is false.\n\nScenario 2: Ben did not eat pasta\nIn this scenario, the conditional statement does not apply, as Ben did not eat pasta. This means that Kate not eating the salad is not necessarily related to Ben's food choice.\n\nBased on these scenarios, we can infer that the statement \"Ben did not eat pasta\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
