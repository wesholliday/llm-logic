If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nFrom 1, we know that the banana is not yellow.\n\nFrom 2, we know that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility of the apple being red:\n\nIf the apple is red, then according to 2, the banana should be yellow. But we know from 1 that the banana is not yellow. This means that the apple cannot be red, as it would contradict the fact that the banana is not yellow.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the apple is not red.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
