If the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside, and vice versa.\n\nNow, let's think about how we can use these two statements to infer whether the dog was inside or outside.\n\nIf the cat was not outside, then it must have been inside, because the only other option is that the cat was outside, and we know that's not the case.\n\nNow, let's look at the second statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" Since we've established that the cat was inside, we can infer that the dog must have been inside as well, because if the dog was outside, then the cat would have been outside too, which contradicts our first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the dog was inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
