However, this contradicts the first statement, which states that the book is not a mystery novel. Therefore, this scenario is unlikely.\n\nScenario 2: The book was not written by James.\nIn this scenario, the book would not be a mystery novel, which aligns with the first statement. Additionally, this scenario does not contradict the second statement, as it does not mention James writing the book.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
