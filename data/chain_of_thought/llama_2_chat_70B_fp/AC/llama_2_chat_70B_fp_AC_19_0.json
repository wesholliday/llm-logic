            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information is in the form of a conditional statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" and a separate statement \"Jen watched basketball\". To determine if we can infer \"Tom watched football\", we need to evaluate the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe conditional statement implies that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. In other words, if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nNow, we know that Jen watched basketball. This means that the condition in the conditional statement (\"If Tom watched football\") is not met, as Tom did not watch football. Therefore, we cannot infer that Tom watched football.\n\nAnswer: No",
