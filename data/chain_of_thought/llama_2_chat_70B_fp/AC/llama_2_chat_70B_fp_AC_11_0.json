In this case, the premises are \"The muffins were blueberry\" and \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\".\n\nIf we assume that the premises are true, we can deduce the conclusion \"The cake was chocolate\" by modus ponens, which states that if \"If A then B\" and \"B\" are true, then \"A\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer \"The cake was chocolate\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
