            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information is in the form of a conditional statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" and a separate statement \"The pants were denim\".\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The shirt was cotton\", we need to evaluate the validity of the conditional statement and see if it leads to a logical conclusion.\n\nThe conditional statement implies that the shirt being cotton is a sufficient condition for the pants to be denim. In other words, if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim.\n\nThe separate statement \"The pants were denim\" confirms that the pants are indeed denim.\n\nUsing modus ponens, a logical rule of inference, we can conclude that if the sufficient condition (shirt being cotton) is met, then the conclusion (pants being denim) must also be true. Therefore, the shirt must have been cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
