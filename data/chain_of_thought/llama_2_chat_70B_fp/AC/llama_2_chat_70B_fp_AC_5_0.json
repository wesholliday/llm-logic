            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information consists of two parts:\n\n1. \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" - This is a conditional statement, where the truth of the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) implies the truth of the consequent (Amy played tennis).\n2. \"Amy played tennis\" - This is a declarative statement, asserting that Amy played tennis.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"Jeff played basketball\" from the given information, we need to evaluate whether the truth of the consequent (Amy played tennis) implies the truth of the antecedent (Jeff played basketball).\n\nIn this case, we can infer that Jeff played basketball because the truth of the consequent (Amy played tennis) is a result of the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) being true. In other words, since Amy played tennis, it must be the case that Jeff played basketball, as the conditional statement dictates.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
