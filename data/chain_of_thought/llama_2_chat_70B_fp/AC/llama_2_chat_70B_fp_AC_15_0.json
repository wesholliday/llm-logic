To determine if we can infer \"Sam took a plane\", we need to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe conditional statement implies that the occurrence of the consequent (Erin took a train) is a result of the antecedent (Sam took a plane) being true. In other words, if Sam took a plane, then Erin taking a train is a certainty.\n\nGiven that we know Erin took a train, we can conclude that the antecedent (Sam took a plane) must be true, as the consequent (Erin took a train) has occurred. In other words, the fact that Erin took a train supports the idea that Sam took a plane.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer \"Sam took a plane\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
