            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information is in the form of a conditional statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and a separate statement \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n\nTo infer \"Mary was at the wedding\" from the given information, we need to use modus ponens, which is a rule of inference that allows us to deduce the conclusion of a conditional statement when the premises are true.\n\nThe conditional statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" can be represented as \"M \u2192 S\", where \"M\" represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \"S\" represents \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n\nThe separate statement \"Sue was at the wedding\" can be represented as \"S\".\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can deduce the conclusion \"M\" from the premises \"M \u2192 S\" and \"S\". This can be done by inferring that since \"Sue was at the wedding\" (S), then \"Mary was at the wedding\" (M) must also be true, given that \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" (M \u2192 S).\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
