The wolf was in the den.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The bear was in the cave\" from these premises.\n\nLet's break down the first premise: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This statement implies that the bear's presence in the cave is sufficient to guarantee the wolf's presence in the den. In other words, if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise: \"The wolf was in the den.\" This statement tells us that the wolf was indeed in the den.\n\nUsing modus ponens, a logical rule that allows us to deduce a conclusion from two premises, we can infer that the bear was in the cave. Modus ponens states that if \"If A, then B\" and \"B,\" then we can deduce \"A.\" In this case, A is \"the bear was in the cave\" and B is \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer \"The bear was in the cave.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
