The conclusion is saying that it's possible that the griffin might not have been in the forest.\n\nThe reasoning behind this argument is that if it's not necessarily true that the griffin must have been in the forest, then it's possible that the griffin might not have been in the forest. This makes sense, because if something is not necessarily true, then it's possible that it might not be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, because the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
