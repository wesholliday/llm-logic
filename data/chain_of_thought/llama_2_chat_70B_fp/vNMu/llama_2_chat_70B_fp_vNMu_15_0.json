The conclusion is saying that it's possible that the shoes might not be in the closet.\n\nThe modus tollens argument is logically valid, as it follows the rule of logical inference. The conclusion logically follows from the premise. If it's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet, then it's possible that they might not be in the closet.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
