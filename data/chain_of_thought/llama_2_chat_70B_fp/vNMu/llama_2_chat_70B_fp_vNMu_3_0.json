The premise is saying that it's not the case that the book must have been written by James, which is equivalent to saying that it's possible that the book was not written by James. The conclusion is then saying that the book might not have been written by James, which is a weaker statement than the premise.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows logically from the premise. If it's possible that the book was not written by James, then it's certainly possible that the book might not have been written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
