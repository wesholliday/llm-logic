The conclusion is saying that it's possible that the notebook might not be in the drawer.\n\nThe modus tollens argument is logically valid, as it follows the rule of logical inference. The conclusion logically follows from the premise. If it's not necessarily true that the notebook must be in the drawer, then it's possible that it might not be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
