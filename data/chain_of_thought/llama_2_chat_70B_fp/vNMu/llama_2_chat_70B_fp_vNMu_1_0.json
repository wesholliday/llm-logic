The conclusion is saying that it's possible that Mary might not have been at the wedding.\n\nThe modus tollens argument is logically valid because it follows the rule of logical necessity. The premise is negating the necessity of p, which means that p might not be true. Therefore, the conclusion that p might not be true is logically supported by the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
