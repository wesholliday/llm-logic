The conclusion is that it's possible that the sunglasses might not be in her bag.\n\nThe modus tollens argument is logically valid because it follows the rule of logical negation. The premise is negating the necessity of p, which means that p might not be true. The conclusion is then stating that p might not be true, which is a logical consequence of the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
