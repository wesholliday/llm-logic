            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" implies a causal relationship between Lisa's action and Mark's action. In other words, Lisa's purchase of the red shirt led to Mark's purchase of the blue shirt.\n\nIf we want to infer that \"if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt,\" we need to reverse the causal relationship. In other words, we need to assume that Mark's purchase of the blue shirt led to Lisa's purchase of the red shirt.\n\nHowever, we cannot make this inference based on the information provided. There is no evidence to suggest that Mark's purchase of the blue shirt caused Lisa to buy the red shirt. In fact, it's possible that Lisa bought the red shirt before Mark bought the blue shirt, or that they bought their shirts independently of each other.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
