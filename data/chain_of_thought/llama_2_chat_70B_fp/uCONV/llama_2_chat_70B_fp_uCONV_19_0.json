In other words, Tom watching football is sufficient to conclude that Jen watched basketball.\n\nHowever, we want to infer the converse of this statement, which is \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football.\" To determine if we can make this inference, we need to examine the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe converse of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, but with the antecedent and consequent switched. In this case, the antecedent of the original statement is \"Tom watched football,\" and the consequent is \"Jen watched basketball.\" To form the converse, we switch these parts, resulting in \"Jen watched basketball\" as the antecedent and \"Tom watched football\" as the consequent.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
