In other words, if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race too.\n\nNow, let's consider the converse of this statement: \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race.\" This statement implies that Chris's finishing the race is a sufficient condition for Alex to have finished the race. However, this is not necessarily true.\n\nFor example, it's possible that Chris finished the race, but Alex did not. Perhaps Chris was faster than Alex and finished the race before Alex did, or maybe Alex encountered some obstacle that prevented him from finishing the race. In this case, the converse statement would be false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race. The given statement only implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race, but it does not imply the converse.\n\nAnswer: No.",
