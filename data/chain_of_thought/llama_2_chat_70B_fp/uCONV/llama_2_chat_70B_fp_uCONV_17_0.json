In other words, we would need to know that if Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta, and also that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\n\nHowever, the given statement only establishes a unidirectional relationship, where Ben eating pasta guarantees that Kate ate salad, but does not guarantee that Ben ate pasta if Kate ate salad. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta.\n\nAnswer: No",
