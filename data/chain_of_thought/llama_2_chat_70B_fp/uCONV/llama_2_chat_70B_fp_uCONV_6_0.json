In other words, Sue's choice of pizza leads to Bob's choice of pasta.\n\nIf we want to infer that \"if Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza,\" we need to reverse the causal relationship between the two choices. In other words, we need to assume that Bob's choice of pasta leads to Sue's choice of pizza.\n\nHowever, the given statement does not provide enough information to establish a causal relationship between Bob's choice and Sue's choice. It only tells us that Sue's choice is dependent on Bob's choice, but it does not imply that Bob's choice is dependent on Sue's choice.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"if Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza\" based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
