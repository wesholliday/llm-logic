A symmetric statement is one where the order of the premises can be reversed without changing the truth of the statement. In this case, we can reverse the order of the premises by switching \"Mary\" and \"Sue\" in the statement:\n\n\"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nThis revised statement is still true, as the presence of Sue at the wedding still implies the presence of Mary at the wedding. Therefore, the statement is symmetric, and we can infer the converse.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
