Specifically, if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that if the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate, we need to examine the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe contrapositive of the given statement is \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\" This statement indicates that if the muffins are not blueberry, then the cake is not chocolate.\n\nNow, let's consider the inverse of the given statement, which is \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate.\" This statement is the same as the original statement, just reworded.\n\nSince the contrapositive and the inverse of the given statement are both true, we can conclude that the relationship between the two statements is symmetrical. Therefore, we can infer that if the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
