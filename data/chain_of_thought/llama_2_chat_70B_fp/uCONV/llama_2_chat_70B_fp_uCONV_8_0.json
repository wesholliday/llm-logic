In other words, if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must be awake.\n\nHowever, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. Just because the mummy is awake, it does not mean that the vampire must be awake. The mummy's awakeness does not provide any information about the vampire's state.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake. The relationship between the two statements is not symmetrical, and we need more information to make any conclusions about the vampire's state.\n\nAnswer: No.",
