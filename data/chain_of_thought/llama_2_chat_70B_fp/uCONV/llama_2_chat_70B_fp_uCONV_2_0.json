In other words, just because the unicorn is in the forest, it does not mean that the griffin is also in the forest. There is no logical connection between the presence of the unicorn and the presence of the griffin.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest.\n\nAnswer: No",
