            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was not spened\" can be represented as:\n\nVroombed \u279d Not Spened\n\nThis statement indicates that the condition of being vroombed implies the negation of being spened. In other words, if something is vroombed, then it cannot be spened.\n\nNow, to determine if we can infer \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed,\" we need to consider the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive is obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement. In this case, the contrapositive would be:\n\nNot Spened \u279d Not Vroombed\n\nThis contrapositive statement indicates that if something is not spened, then it cannot be vroombed. In other words, the negation of being spened implies the negation of being vroombed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
