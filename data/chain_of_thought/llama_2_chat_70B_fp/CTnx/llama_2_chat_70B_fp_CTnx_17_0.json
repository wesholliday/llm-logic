This can be represented as:\n\nMovated \u2192 \u00acSkizzled\n\nTo determine if we can infer the latter statement from the former, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Negate the original statement:\n\n\u00acSkizzled \u2192 \u00ac\u00acMovated (using De Morgan's law)\n\n2. Apply modus ponens:\n\n\u00acSkizzled \u2192 \u00acMovated\n\n3. Negate the conclusion:\n\n\u00ac\u00acMovated \u2192 Movated (using double negation)\n\n4. Apply modus ponens:\n\nMovated \u2192 \u00acSkizzled\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the flob movated, then the flob was not skizzled\" from \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob did not movate\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
