The converse of the statement would be:\n\n\"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was fraggled.\"\n\nThis converse statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, as it follows from the same premise that fraggling and smoogling are mutually exclusive. Therefore, we can infer the converse statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
