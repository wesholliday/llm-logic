This can be represented as:\n\nnugged \u2192 \u00acplooked\n\nTo determine if we can infer the desired statement from the given statement, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Negate the given statement:\n\n\u00acplooked \u2192 \u00ac\u00acnugged (using De Morgan's law)\n\n2. Negate the desired statement:\n\n\u00acnugged \u2192 \u00acplooked\n\n3. Equate the two negated statements:\n\n\u00acplooked \u2192 \u00ac\u00acnugged \u2194 \u00acnugged \u2192 \u00acplooked\n\nSince the two statements are logically equivalent, we can infer the desired statement \"If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked\" from the given statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was not nugged\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
