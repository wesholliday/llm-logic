If the whiffle tink, then it did not shank. (This is the given statement, stated in the negative form)\n2. If the whiffle did not shank, then it was not shanked. (This is a logical deduction, as \"shanked\" means \"to hit or throw (a ball) in a wild or awkward way\")\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\n\nTink \u279d \u00acShanked\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
