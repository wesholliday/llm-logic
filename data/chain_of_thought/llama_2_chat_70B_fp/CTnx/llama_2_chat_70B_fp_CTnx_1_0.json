The contrapositive of a statement is obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion, and then negating both parts. In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled\" would be:\n\nIf the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was blimmed\n\nThis contrapositive statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the flugel was not zargled, then it must have been blimmed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
