The contrapositive of a statement is obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion, and then negating both parts. In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint\" would be:\n\nIf the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was flooped.\n\nThis contrapositive statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the wug did not bim the zoint, then we can conclude that the wug was flooped.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was not flooped\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
