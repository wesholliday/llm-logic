            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement, \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg did not sproted the frink.\" This statement implies that the condition of the sneg being crampled is sufficient to conclude that the sneg did not sproted the frink.\n\nTo infer the converse of this statement, we need to switch the condition and the conclusion. The converse of the statement would be, \"If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer the converse from the given statement, we need to check if the converse is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, we need to check if the converse implies the original statement, and vice versa.\n\nLet's assume that the converse is true, \"If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\" If this statement is true, then it means that whenever the sneg sproted the frink, the sneg was not crampled. This implies that the condition of the sneg being crampled is sufficient to conclude that the sneg did not sproted the frink, which is the same as the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the converse of the statement, \"If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled\" from the given statement, \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg did not sproted the frink.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
