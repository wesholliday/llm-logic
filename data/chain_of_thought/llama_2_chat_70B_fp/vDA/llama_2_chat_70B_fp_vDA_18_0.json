            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its structure and see if it follows a valid pattern of reasoning. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n2. The doll was not plastic.\n3. Therefore, the truck was not metal.\n\nThis argument is an example of a modus tollens argument, which has the following form:\n\n1. If A, then B.\n2. Not A.\n3. Therefore, not B.\n\nModus tollens is a valid form of argument, as long as the premises are true, because it follows the logical principle of contraposition. In this case, the first premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal, which means that if the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal. The second premise states that the doll was not plastic, which means that the truck was not metal, following the contrapositive principle.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, as it follows a valid pattern of reasoning.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
