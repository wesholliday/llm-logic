            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its structure and the relationships between the premises and conclusion. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n2. Joe did not go to the park.\n3. Therefore, Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nThe argument is a conditional argument, with the first premise stating a conditional relationship between Joe's action and Lucy's action. The second premise negates the antecedent of the first premise, which means that the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nIf we were to represent this argument using a truth table, it would look like this:\n\n| Premise 1 | Premise 2 | Conclusion |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| T | T | T |\n| T | F | F |\n| F | T | F |\n| F | F | F |\n\nAs we can see from the truth table, when the first premise is true and the second premise is false, the conclusion is false. This means that the argument is valid, as the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
