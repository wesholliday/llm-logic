            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its structure and the relationships between the premises and conclusion. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n2. The bear was not in the cave.\n3. Therefore, the wolf was not in the den.\n\nThe argument is a form of modus tollens, which has the following structure:\n\n1. If A, then B.\n2. Not A.\n3. Therefore, not B.\n\nIn this case, A is \"the bear was in the cave\" and B is \"the wolf was in the den\".\n\nThe first premise establishes a conditional relationship between A and B, stating that if A is true, then B must also be true. The second premise states that A is false. Therefore, using modus tollens, we can logically conclude that B is also false, which means that the wolf was not in the den.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
