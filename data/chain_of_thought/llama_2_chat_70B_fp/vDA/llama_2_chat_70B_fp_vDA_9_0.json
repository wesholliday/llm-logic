            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the first premise stating a conditional relationship between Lisa's action (buying the red shirt) and Mark's action (buying the blue shirt). The second premise states that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. The conclusion drawn from these premises is that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, is it necessarily true that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt?\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. Lisa bought the red shirt: In this case, the first premise is true, and the conclusion that Mark bought the blue shirt logically follows.\n2. Lisa did not buy the red shirt: In this case, the first premise is false, and the conclusion that Mark did not buy the blue shirt logically follows.\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises in both possible scenarios, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
