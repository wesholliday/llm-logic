            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a modus tollens argument, which has the following form:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nNot P.\nTherefore, not Q.\n\nIn this case, P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding\". The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. The second premise states that Mary was not at the wedding. The conclusion is that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, is it necessarily true that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true?\n\nIf we assume that the first premise is true, then we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. However, the second premise states that Mary was not at the wedding. Therefore, we can conclude that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nThis argument follows the modus tollens pattern, where the first premise establishes a conditional relationship between P and Q, and the second premise denies the antecedent (P), which allows us to conclude that the consequent (Q) cannot be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
