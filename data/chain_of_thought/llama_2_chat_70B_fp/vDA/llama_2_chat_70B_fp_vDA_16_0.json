            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a modus tollens argument, which has the following form:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nNot P.\nTherefore, not Q.\n\nIn this case, P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim\". The first premise states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. The second premise states that the shirt was not cotton. The conclusion is that the pants were not denim.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, must the conclusion also be true?\n\nIf we assume that the first premise is true, then we can deduce that if the shirt was cotton, the pants were denim. However, the second premise states that the shirt was not cotton, which means that the condition for the conclusion (the shirt being cotton) is not met. Therefore, we cannot deduce that the pants were denim.\n\nSince the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No.",
