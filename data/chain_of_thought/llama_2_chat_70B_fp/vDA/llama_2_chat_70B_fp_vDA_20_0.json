            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the first premise stating a conditional relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana. The second premise negates the first premise's antecedent (the apple being red), which means that the conclusion must be true if the argument is logically valid.\n\nIn order for the argument to be logically valid, the conclusion must follow necessarily from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nGiven the first premise, if the apple were red, then the banana would have to be yellow. Since the second premise states that the apple was not red, it means that the antecedent of the first premise (the apple being red) is false. Therefore, the conclusion that the banana was not yellow logically follows.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
