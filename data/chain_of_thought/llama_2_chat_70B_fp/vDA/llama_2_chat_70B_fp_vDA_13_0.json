            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its structure and see if it follows a valid pattern. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n2. The car was not red.\n3. Therefore, the truck was not blue.\n\nThis argument is an example of a conditional argument, where the first premise establishes a conditional relationship between the car's color and the truck's color. The second premise negates the antecedent of the conditional statement, which means that the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nIn this case, if the car was not red, then the condition for the truck to be blue is not met, and therefore, the truck cannot be blue. This reasoning is logically sound, as the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid.",
