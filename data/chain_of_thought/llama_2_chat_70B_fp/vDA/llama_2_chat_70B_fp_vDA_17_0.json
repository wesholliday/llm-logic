            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the first premise stating a conditional relationship between Ben's action (eating pasta) and Kate's action (eating salad). The second premise states that the condition (Ben eating pasta) is not met. Therefore, we can conclude that the conclusion (Kate did not eat salad) logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe form of the argument is:\n\n1. If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\n2. Ben did not eat pasta.\n3. Therefore, Kate did not eat salad.\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Modus tollens involves denying the antecedent (Ben did not eat pasta) of a conditional statement (If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad), which leads to the conclusion that the consequent (Kate did not eat salad) is also false.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
