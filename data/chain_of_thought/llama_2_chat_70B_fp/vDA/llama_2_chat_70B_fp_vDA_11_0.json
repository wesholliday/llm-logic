            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its structure and see if it follows a valid pattern. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n2. The cake was not chocolate.\n3. Therefore, the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nThis argument is an example of a conditional argument, where the first premise establishes a conditional relationship between the cake and the muffins. The second premise negates the antecedent of the conditional, which leads to the conclusion that the consequent (the muffins being blueberry) cannot be true.\n\nThe validity of this argument depends on the truth of the premises and the logical relationship between them. If the premises are true and the conclusion logically follows, then the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because if the first premise is true, then the conclusion must be true. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry, but since the cake was not chocolate, it logically follows that the muffins were not blueberry. The argument follows a valid pattern of reasoning, and the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making it a logically valid argument.",
