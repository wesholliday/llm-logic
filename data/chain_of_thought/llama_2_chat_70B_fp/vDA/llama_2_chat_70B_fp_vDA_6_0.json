The second premise states that Sue did not choose pizza. The conclusion is that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, must the conclusion also be true?\n\nLet's assume that the first premise is true. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. Since the second premise states that Sue did not choose pizza, we can conclude that Bob did not choose pasta. This conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
