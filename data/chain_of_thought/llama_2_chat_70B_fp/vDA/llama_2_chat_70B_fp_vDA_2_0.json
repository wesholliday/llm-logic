            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its structure and see if it follows a valid pattern. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n2. The griffin was not in the forest.\n3. Therefore, the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nThis argument is an example of a conditional argument, where the first premise establishes a conditional relationship between the griffin and the unicorn, and the second premise provides information about the griffin's presence in the forest.\n\nIf we assume that the first premise is true, then we can deduce that if the griffin was in the forest, the unicorn would also be in the forest. However, since the second premise states that the griffin was not in the forest, we can conclude that the unicorn was not in the forest either.\n\nTherefore, the argument follows logically from its premises to its conclusion, and it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
