            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its structure and premises. The argument is of the form:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not P\n3. Therefore, not Q\n\nWhere P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel\".\n\nThe first premise establishes a conditional relationship between P and Q, stating that if P is true, then Q must also be true. The second premise negates P, stating that it is not the case that the book was written by James. The conclusion then logically follows from the first two premises, stating that since P is not true, Q cannot be true either, and therefore the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nThe argument's structure is valid, as it follows the modus tollens format, which is a valid form of argumentation. The conclusion logically follows from the premises. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
