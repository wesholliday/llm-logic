            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its structure and see if it follows a valid pattern. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n2. The dog was not inside.\n3. Therefore, the cat was not outside.\n\nThis argument is an example of a modus tollens argument, which has the following form:\n\n1. If A, then B.\n2. Not A.\n3. Therefore, not B.\n\nModus tollens is a valid form of argument, as it follows the rule of logical inference. The first premise establishes a conditional relationship between A and B, and the second premise negates A. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows that not B.\n\nIn the given argument, the first premise establishes a conditional relationship between the dog being inside and the cat being outside. The second premise negates the dog being inside, which means that the cat being outside is not possible. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows that the cat was not outside.\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid.",
