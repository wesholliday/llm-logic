            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the first premise stating a conditional relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis. The second premise states that Jeff did not play basketball. The conclusion drawn from these premises is that Amy did not play tennis.\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, is it necessarily true that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis?\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. Jeff played basketball: In this case, the first premise is true, and the second premise is false. The conclusion, \"Amy did not play tennis,\" would also be false, as Amy would have played tennis if Jeff played basketball.\n2. Jeff did not play basketball: In this case, both premises are true. The conclusion, \"Amy did not play tennis,\" would also be true, as Jeff did not play basketball, and therefore, Amy did not play tennis.\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises in both possible scenarios, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
