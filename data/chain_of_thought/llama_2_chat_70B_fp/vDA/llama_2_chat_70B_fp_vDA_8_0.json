            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its structure and premises. The argument is of the form:\n\nIf A, then B\nNot A\nTherefore, not B\n\nWhere A is \"the vampire was awake\" and B is \"the mummy was awake\".\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (A) is true, then the consequent (B) must also be true. The second premise is a negation of the antecedent (A), which means that the antecedent is false.\n\nIf we assume that the first premise is true, then we can deduce that the consequent (B) is also true. However, the second premise states that the antecedent (A) is false, which means that the consequent (B) cannot be true. This creates a contradiction, as we have deduced that B is both true and false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically invalid because it leads to a contradiction. The conclusion \"the mummy was not awake\" cannot be logically deduced from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
