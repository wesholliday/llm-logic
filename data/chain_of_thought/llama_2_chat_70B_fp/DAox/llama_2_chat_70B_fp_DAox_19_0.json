If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer the conclusion:\n\n3. The smonk was not plagged.\n\nLet's break down the second premise:\n\n2. If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\n\nThis premise states that if the smonk was vreebled, then it must have plagged. In other words, vreebled implies plagged.\n\nNow, let's consider the first premise:\n\n1. The smonk was not vreebled.\n\nThis premise states that the smonk was not vreebled. Since vreebled implies plagged, we can infer that the smonk was not plagged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the conclusion:\n\n3. The smonk was not plagged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
