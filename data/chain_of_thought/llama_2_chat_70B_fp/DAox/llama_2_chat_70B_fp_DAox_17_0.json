If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that the flob was not skizzled.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that if the flob was skizzled, then it would have movated.\n\nSince the flob was not skizzled (according to premise 1), it is not possible for the flob to have movated (since skizzling is a necessary condition for movation, according to premise 2).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flob was not movated.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
