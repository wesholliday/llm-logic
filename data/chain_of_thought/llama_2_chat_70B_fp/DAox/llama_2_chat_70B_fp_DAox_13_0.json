If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The glip was not tragged\" based on these statements.\n\nLet's break down the second statement:\n\n2. If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\n\nThis statement is in the form of a conditional, where the antecedent is \"the glip was slogged\" and the consequent is \"the glip was tragged\".\n\nNow, let's consider the first statement:\n\n1. The glip was not slogged.\n\nThis statement tells us that the antecedent of the second statement (i.e., \"the glip was slogged\") is false. Therefore, we can conclude that the consequent of the second statement (i.e., \"the glip was tragged\") is also false.\n\nIn other words, since the glip was not slogged, it follows that the glip was not tragged either.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
