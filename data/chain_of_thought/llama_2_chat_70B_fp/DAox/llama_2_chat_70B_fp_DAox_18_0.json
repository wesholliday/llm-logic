If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the shank was not plooked.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that if the shank was plooked, then it would have been nugged.\n\nSince the shank was not plooked (according to statement 1), it is not possible for it to have been nugged (based on the conditional statement 2).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shank was not nugged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
