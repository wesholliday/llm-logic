If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that if the flugel was blimmed, then it was zargled. However, since we know that the flugel was not blimmed (from statement 1), we can deduce that it was not zargled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flugel was not zargled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
