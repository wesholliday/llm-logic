If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that if the clug was fleeked, then it would have snugged.\n\nSince the clug was not fleeked (according to statement 1), it is not possible for it to have snugged (according to statement 2). Therefore, we can infer that the clug was not snugged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
