If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that the grommet did not sploff. Let's assume that the grommet did plop the frink. If the grommet plopped the frink, then it must have sploffed, since plopping the frink is a consequence of sploffing.\n\nHowever, this assumption contradicts premise 1, which states that the grommet did not sploff. Therefore, we cannot infer that the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nAnswer: No.",
