            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on a conditional statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" and a premise \"The splat was not morphed\". We need to determine if we can infer \"The splat did not quank\" from these two statements.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked (conditional statement)\n2. The splat was not morphed (premise)\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the splat was morphed, then it quanked. Since the splat was not morphed (according to the second statement), it means that it did not quank.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The splat did not quank\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
