If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The fleeg did not surn\" from these premises.\n\nLet's break down the second premise: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\" This premise implies that bluttering is a sufficient condition for surning. In other words, if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have surned.\n\nNow, let's consider the first premise: \"The fleeg was not bluttered.\" This premise tells us that the fleeg did not meet the sufficient condition for surning, which means it did not surn.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer \"The fleeg did not surn.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
