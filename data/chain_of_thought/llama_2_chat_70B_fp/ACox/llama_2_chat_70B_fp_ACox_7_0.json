To determine if we can infer \"The whiffle was shanked\", we need to use modus ponens, a rule of inference that allows us to conclude a conditional statement's antecedent (in this case, \"The whiffle was shanked\") given the succedent (in this case, \"The whiffle tinked\") and the premise of the conditional statement.\n\nModus ponens states that if we have two statements, \"If A then B\" and \"B\", we can conclude \"A\". In this case, \"A\" is \"The whiffle was shanked\" and \"B\" is \"The whiffle tinked\".\n\nTherefore, using modus ponens, we can infer \"The whiffle was shanked\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
