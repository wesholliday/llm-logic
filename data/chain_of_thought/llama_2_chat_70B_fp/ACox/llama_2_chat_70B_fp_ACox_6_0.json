To infer \"The grommet was sploffed\", we need to use modus ponens, a rule of inference that allows us to deduce the antecedent of a conditional statement from the consequent and the premise.\n\nModus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is true, we can infer that A is true. In this case, we have the conditional statement \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" and we know that the grommet plopped the frink. Therefore, we can infer that the grommet was sploffed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
