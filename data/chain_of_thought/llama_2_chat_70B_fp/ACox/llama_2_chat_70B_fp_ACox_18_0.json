We need to determine if we can infer \"The sprocket was cranked\" based on these two statements.\n\nThe conditional statement implies that if the sprocket was cranked, then it was definitely daggled. However, the converse is not necessarily true - just because the sprocket is daggled, it doesn't mean that it was cranked. There could be other reasons why the sprocket is daggled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer \"The sprocket was cranked\" from the given information. We would need additional information or context to support this inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
