To determine if we can infer \"The fribble was snurgled\", we need to use modus ponens, a rule of inference that allows us to conclude a conditional statement's antecedent (in this case, \"The fribble was snurgled\") given the consequent (in this case, \"The fribble was crinked\") and the premise of the conditional statement.\n\nModus ponens states that if we have two statements, \"If A then B\" and \"B\", we can conclude \"A\". In this case, we have the first statement in the form of the conditional \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble was crinked\" and the second statement \"The fribble was crinked\". Therefore, we can use modus ponens to conclude \"The fribble was snurgled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
