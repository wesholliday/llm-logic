To determine if we can infer \"The whiffle was shanked\", we need to use modus ponens, a rule of inference that allows us to conclude a conditional statement's consequent (in this case, \"the whiffle was tinked\") given the antecedent (in this case, \"the whiffle was shanked\") and the conditional statement itself.\n\nModus ponens states that if we have two statements, \"If A then B\" and \"B\", we can conclude \"A\". In this case, we have the first statement in the form of the conditional \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle was tinked\" and the second statement \"The whiffle was tinked\". Therefore, we can use modus ponens to conclude that \"The whiffle was shanked\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
