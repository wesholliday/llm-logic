This means that if the grommet was indeed sploffed, then it must have been plopped.\n\nHowever, we are also given the information that the grommet was plopped. This means that the condition in the conditional statement has been satisfied, and we can infer that the grommet was indeed sploffed.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
