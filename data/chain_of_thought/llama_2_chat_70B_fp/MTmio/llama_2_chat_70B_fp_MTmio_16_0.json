However, the first statement suggests that the pants might not have been denim, which means that this scenario is not possible.\n\nScenario 2: The shirt was not cotton.\nIn this scenario, the pants could have been made of any material, including cotton. However, since the shirt was not cotton, the second statement does not apply, and we cannot infer that the pants must have been denim.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
