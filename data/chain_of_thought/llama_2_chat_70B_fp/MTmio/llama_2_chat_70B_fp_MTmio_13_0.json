It means that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the car was red.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The car was red.\nIn this scenario, the truck must have been blue, according to the second statement. However, since the truck's color is uncertain, we can't conclude that the car was not red.\n\nScenario 2: The car was not red.\nIn this scenario, the truck might still have been blue, but we don't have any information to confirm or deny it.\n\nSince we can't conclude that the car was not red based on the given information, we can't infer \"The car was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
