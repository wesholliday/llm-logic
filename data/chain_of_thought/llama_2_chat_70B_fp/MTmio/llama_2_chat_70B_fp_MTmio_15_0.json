In other words, if Sam flew, then Erin must have taken a train.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. Sam took a plane: In this case, Erin must have taken a train, according to the second premise.\n2. Sam did not take a plane: In this case, Erin might or might not have taken a train, as the first premise states.\n\nBased on the information given, we cannot infer with certainty whether Sam took a plane or not. However, we can infer that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that Sam did not take a plane.",
