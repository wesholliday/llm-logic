If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nFrom 1, we know that Bob's choice is uncertain, and we can't rule out the possibility that he didn't choose pasta.\n\nFrom 2, we know that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob's choice is determined, and he must have chosen pasta.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Sue chose pizza.\nIn this scenario, Bob's choice is determined, and he must have chosen pasta, according to the second premise. Therefore, this scenario is inconsistent with the first premise, which states that Bob might not have chosen pasta.\n\nScenario 2: Sue did not choose pizza.\nIn this scenario, Bob's choice is uncertain, and we can't rule out the possibility that he didn't choose pasta. This scenario is consistent with both premises.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
