However, this contradicts the first statement, which states that the book might not be a mystery novel. Therefore, this scenario is unlikely.\n\nScenario 2: The book was not written by James.\nIn this scenario, the book might still be a mystery novel, but it might not be, since the second statement doesn't apply. This scenario is consistent with both statements.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
