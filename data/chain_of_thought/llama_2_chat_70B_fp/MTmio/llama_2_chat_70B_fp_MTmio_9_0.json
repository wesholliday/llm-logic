If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nFrom 1, we know that Mark's purchase of the blue shirt is uncertain.\nFrom 2, we know that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt (this is a conditional statement).\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Lisa bought the red shirt.\nIn this scenario, the conditional statement in 2 implies that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. However, we know from 1 that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, so this scenario is inconsistent with the given information.\n\nScenario 2: Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\nIn this scenario, the conditional statement in 2 does not apply, as Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Therefore, Mark's purchase of the blue shirt is still uncertain, consistent with 1.\n\nSince Scenario 2 is consistent with the given information, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
