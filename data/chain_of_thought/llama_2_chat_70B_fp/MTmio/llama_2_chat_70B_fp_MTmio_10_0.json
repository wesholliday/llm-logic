If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside, and vice versa.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The dog was inside.\nIn this scenario, the cat must have been outside, according to the second statement. Therefore, the cat's location is determined, and it was outside.\n\nScenario 2: The dog was not inside.\nIn this scenario, the cat's location is still uncertain, as it might have been inside or outside.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer that if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside. Therefore, the statement \"The dog was not inside\" can be inferred from the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
