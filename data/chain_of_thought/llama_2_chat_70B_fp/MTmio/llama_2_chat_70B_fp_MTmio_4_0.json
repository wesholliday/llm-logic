In other words, the robot's visit to Jupiter is conditional on the alien's visit to Mars.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The alien visited Mars.\nIn this scenario, the robot must have visited Jupiter, according to the second statement.\n\nScenario 2: The alien did not visit Mars.\nIn this scenario, the robot might not have visited Jupiter, as stated in the first statement.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer that if the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot might not have visited Jupiter. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The alien did not visit Mars\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No.",
