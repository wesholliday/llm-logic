            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\" means that Sue's attendance at the wedding is uncertain.\n2. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" means that if Mary was present, then Sue must have been present as well, since Sue's attendance is dependent on Mary's.\n3. Now, we want to infer \"Mary was not at the wedding\" from the given statements.\n\nIf we assume that Mary was at the wedding, then using the second statement, we can conclude that Sue must have been at the wedding too. However, this contradicts the first statement, which states that Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, the only way to reconcile the two statements is to assume that Mary was not at the wedding, which means that Sue's attendance is still uncertain.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer \"Mary was not at the wedding\" from the given statements.",
