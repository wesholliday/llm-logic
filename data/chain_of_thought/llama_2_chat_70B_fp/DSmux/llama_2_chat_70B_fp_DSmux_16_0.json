It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can deduce that the sneg is either crampled or must be sproted. Since premise 2 states that it's not the case that the sneg must be sproted, we can conclude that the sneg is not sproted. Therefore, by process of elimination, the sneg must be crampled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
