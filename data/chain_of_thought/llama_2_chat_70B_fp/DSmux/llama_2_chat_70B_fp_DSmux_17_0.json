It's not the case that the flob must be movated.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can deduce that the flob is either skizzled or must be movated. Since premise 2 states that it's not the case that the flob must be movated, we can conclude that the flob is not movated. Therefore, by process of elimination, the flob must be skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
