It's not the case that the splat must be quanked.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can deduce that the splat is either morphed or must be quanked. Since premise 2 states that it's not the case that the splat must be quanked, we can conclude that the splat is not quanked. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
