The second premise \"It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed\" implies that the flug is not in the state of being zimmed.\n\nIf the flug is not in the state of being zimmed, then it must be in the state of being blummed, since these are the only two possible states according to the first premise. Therefore, we can infer that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
