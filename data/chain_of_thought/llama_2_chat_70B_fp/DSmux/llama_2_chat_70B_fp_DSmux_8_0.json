It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can deduce that the sprocket is either cranked or daggled. Since premise 2 states that the sprocket must not be daggled, we can eliminate the possibility that the sprocket is daggled. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
