It's not the case that the wug must be garpled.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can deduce that the wug is either sproinged or garpled. Since premise 2 states that the wug must not be garpled, we can eliminate the possibility that the wug is garpled. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
