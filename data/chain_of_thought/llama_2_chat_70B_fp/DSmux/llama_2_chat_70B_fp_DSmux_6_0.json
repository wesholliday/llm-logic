It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can deduce that the grommet is either sploffed or must be plopped. Since premise 2 states that it's not the case that the grommet must be plopped, we can conclude that the grommet is not plopped. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
