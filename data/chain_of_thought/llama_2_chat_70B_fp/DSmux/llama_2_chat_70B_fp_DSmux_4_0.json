It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can deduce that the fribble is either snurgled or crinked. Since premise 2 states that it's not the case that the fribble must be crinked, we can conclude that the fribble is not crinked. Therefore, by process of elimination, the fribble must be snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
