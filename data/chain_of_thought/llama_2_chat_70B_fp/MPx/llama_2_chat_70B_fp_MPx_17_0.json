If the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true, and we can infer the conclusion.\n\nIn this case, the antecedent is \"The flob was skizzled,\" which is stated to be true. Therefore, the consequent \"The flob movated\" must also be true, and we can infer it from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
