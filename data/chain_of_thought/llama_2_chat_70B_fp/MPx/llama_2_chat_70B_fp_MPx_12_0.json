The smip was shripped.\n\nTo infer whether the smip lupped the zoint, we need to evaluate the given premises.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the meaning of \"if-then\" statement. The if-then statement implies that if the condition mentioned in the \"if\" part is true, then the conclusion mentioned in the \"then\" part must also be true. In this case, the \"if\" part is \"the smip was shripped,\" and the \"then\" part is \"the smip lupped the zoint.\"\n\nNow, let's evaluate the second premise, \"The smip was shripped.\" This premise is stating that the condition mentioned in the \"if\" part of the first premise is true. Therefore, we can conclude that the smip was indeed shripped.\n\nSince the smip was shripped, and the if-then statement implies that if the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint, we can logically infer that the smip lupped the zoint.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
