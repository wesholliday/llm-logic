To determine whether we can infer \"The whiffle tinked,\" we need to assess whether the conditional statement is valid and whether its antecedent is true.\n\nThe conditional statement is valid, as it follows the standard form of a conditional statement, \"If A, then B,\" where A is the antecedent, and B is the consequent. The antecedent, \"The whiffle was shanked,\" is given as true, which means that the conditional statement is satisfied, and we can infer the consequent, \"The whiffle tinked.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The whiffle tinked\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
