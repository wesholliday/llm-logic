            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument presented is a deductive argument, with the conclusion 'The dreb was spened' and the premises 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened' and 'The dreb was vroombed'.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement, which asserts that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was spened. The second premise is a statement of fact, asserting that the dreb was indeed vroombed.\n\nUsing modus ponens, a basic rule of logic, we can deduce the conclusion 'The dreb was spened' from the premises. Modus ponens states that if a conditional statement is true and the antecedent (the 'if' part) is true, then the consequent (the 'then' part) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, since the first premise asserts that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was spened, and the second premise states that the dreb was indeed vroombed, we can logically deduce the conclusion that the dreb was spened.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
