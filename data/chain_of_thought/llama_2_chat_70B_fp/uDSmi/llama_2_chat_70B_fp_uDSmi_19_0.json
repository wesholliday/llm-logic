The watch might not be on his wrist.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can deduce that the watch is either charging on the dresser or it is not on his wrist.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the watch might not be on his wrist. This means that the watch could be charging on the dresser, or it could be somewhere else, not on his wrist.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. The watch is charging on the dresser.\n2. The watch is not on his wrist, but it is not charging on the dresser either.\n\nIn scenario 1, the watch is indeed charging on the dresser, which means we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nIn scenario 2, the watch is not on his wrist, but it is also not charging on the dresser. This means that the watch is somewhere else, not on his wrist or charging on the dresser.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
