The newspaper might not be sitting on the porch.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can deduce that the newspaper cannot be in both the driveway and the porch at the same time. Therefore, if it's not in the driveway, it must be on the porch, and if it's not on the porch, it must be in the driveway.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 2. If the newspaper might not be sitting on the porch, that means there's a possibility that it's not on the porch. In that case, by process of elimination, it must be in the driveway.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
