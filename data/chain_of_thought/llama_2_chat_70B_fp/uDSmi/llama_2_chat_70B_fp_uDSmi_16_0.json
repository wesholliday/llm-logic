The pen might not be on my desk.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can conclude that the pen is either in my bag or on my desk, but we can't say for sure which one.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the pen might not be on my desk, which means it could be on my desk or it could be somewhere else.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The pen is on my desk.\nIn this scenario, statement 1 is true, but statement 2 is false. This means that the pen is indeed on my desk, but it's not in my bag.\n\nScenario 2: The pen is in my bag.\nIn this scenario, statement 1 is true, and statement 2 is true. This means that the pen is in my bag, and it's not on my desk.\n\nScenario 3: The pen is neither on my desk nor in my bag.\nIn this scenario, both statement 1 and statement 2 are false. This means that the pen is neither on my desk nor in my bag, which means it could be somewhere else.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possibilities:\n\nScenario 1 is unlikely because statement 2 says that the pen might not be on my desk.\nScenario 2 is possible because it aligns with statement 1 and statement 2.\nScenario 3 is also possible because it aligns with statement 2.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the pen is possibly in my bag (Scenario 2), but we can't rule out the possibility that it's somewhere else (Scenario 3).\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the pen is in my bag.",
