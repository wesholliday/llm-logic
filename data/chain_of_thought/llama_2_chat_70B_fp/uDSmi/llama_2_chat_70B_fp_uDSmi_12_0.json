The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can deduce that the jacket cannot be in both places at once, so it must be either on the chair or in the closet.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the jacket might not be in the closet. This means that there is a possibility that the jacket is not in the closet, but it could still be on the chair.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the jacket might be draped over the chair, but we cannot say for certain without additional information.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
