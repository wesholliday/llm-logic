The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand. (Negation statement)\n\nFrom the first statement, we can conclude that the notebook is either in the drawer or on the nightstand. The second statement indicates that the notebook might not be on the nightstand, which means it could still be in the drawer.\n\nSince the notebook might not be on the nightstand, and it's either in the drawer or on the nightstand, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
