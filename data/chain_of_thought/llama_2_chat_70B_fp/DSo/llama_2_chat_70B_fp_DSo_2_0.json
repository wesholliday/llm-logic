In this case, the first statement (\"The book isn't resting on the table\") is true, and the second statement (\"Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table\") is also true because the book is on the shelf, which is one of the two options.\n\nScenario 2: The book is not on the shelf. In this case, the first statement (\"The book isn't resting on the table\") is still true, but the second statement (\"Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table\") is false because the book is not on the shelf, and it's not resting on the table either.\n\nSince we know that the first statement is true, and the second statement is either true or false, we can conclude that the book must be on the shelf, because that's the only scenario in which both statements are true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
