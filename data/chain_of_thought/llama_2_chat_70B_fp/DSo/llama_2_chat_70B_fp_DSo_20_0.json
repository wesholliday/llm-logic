If the sunglasses were in her bag, they would not be perched on her head. Therefore, the statement \"The sunglasses aren't perched on her head\" implies that the sunglasses are not in her bag.\n\nHowever, we also have the premise \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are perched on her head.\" This means that the sunglasses can only be in one of two locations: her bag or her head. Since we have established that the sunglasses are not perched on her head, the only possible location left is her bag.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
