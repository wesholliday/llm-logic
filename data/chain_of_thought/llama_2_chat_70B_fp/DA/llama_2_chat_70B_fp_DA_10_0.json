            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nLet's break down the given information:\n\n* \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" - This statement implies that the dog and cat are mutually exclusive, meaning that if the dog is inside, the cat must be outside, and vice versa.\n* \"The dog was not inside\" - This statement tells us that the dog is not inside, but it doesn't directly tell us anything about the cat's location.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. The dog is not inside, and the cat is outside. This scenario is consistent with both premises.\n2. The dog is not inside, and the cat is inside. This scenario violates the first premise, as the dog is not inside, but the cat is not outside.\n\nSince we're looking to infer \"The cat was not outside,\" we can conclude that scenario 1 is the only possible scenario that satisfies both premises. Therefore, we can infer that the cat was not outside.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
