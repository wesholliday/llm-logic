The shirt was not cotton.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. Since premise 2 states that the shirt was not cotton, we can conclude that the shirt was not denim.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer anything about the pants from this information. We only know that the shirt was not cotton, but we do not know what material the pants were made of. Therefore, we cannot say whether the pants were denim or not.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the pants were not denim.",
