The car was not red.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. Since premise 2 states that the car was not red, we can conclude that the car was not red.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer anything about the color of the truck from the given premises. We only know that the car was not red, but we don't have any information about the truck's color. Therefore, we cannot say whether the truck was blue or not.\n\nAnswer: No.",
