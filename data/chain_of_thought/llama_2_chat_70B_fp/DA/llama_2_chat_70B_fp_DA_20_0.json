The apple was not red.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, since premise 2 states that the apple was not red, we cannot conclude that the banana was yellow.\n\nIn fact, we can infer the opposite - that the banana was not yellow. This is because if the apple was not red, then the condition for the banana to be yellow (i.e., the apple being red) did not occur. Therefore, we can conclude that the banana was not yellow.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
