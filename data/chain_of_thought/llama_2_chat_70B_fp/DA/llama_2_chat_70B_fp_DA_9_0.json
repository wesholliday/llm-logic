Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nFrom 1, we can infer that if Lisa had bought the red shirt, Mark would have bought the blue shirt. However, since 2 states that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we cannot conclude that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nIn other words, the second statement negates the first statement's possibility, and we cannot infer anything about Mark's purchase from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
