In other words, Chris's finish is dependent on Alex's finish.\n* \"Alex did not finish the race\" - This statement tells us that Alex did not complete the race.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. Alex finished the race: In this scenario, Chris would have also finished the race, according to the first statement. However, this scenario is impossible since we know that Alex did not finish the race.\n2. Alex did not finish the race: In this scenario, we can infer that Chris did not finish the race either, since the first statement implies that Chris's finish is dependent on Alex's finish.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
