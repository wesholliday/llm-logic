The bear is not in the cave, and the wolf is not in the den.\n2. The bear is not in the cave, but the wolf is in the den.\n\nGiven the conditional statement, scenario 2 is not possible, as the bear's absence from the cave means the wolf cannot be in the den. Therefore, the only possible scenario is 1, where both the bear and the wolf are not in their respective locations.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
