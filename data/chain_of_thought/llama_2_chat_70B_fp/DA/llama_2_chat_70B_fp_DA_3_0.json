The conditional statement is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" The negation of this statement is \"The book was not written by James.\"\n\nFrom the negation of the conditional statement, we can infer that the book was not written by James. However, we cannot directly infer that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nThe reason for this is that the negation of the conditional statement only tells us that the book was not written by James, but it does not provide any information about the genre of the book. The book could still be a mystery novel, even if it was not written by James.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The book is not a mystery novel\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
