Since premise 2 states that Tom did not watch football, we can conclude that Tom did not watch football.\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can now infer that since Tom did not watch football, it is not the case that Jen watched basketball. In other words, we can conclude that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
