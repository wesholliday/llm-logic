            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information is in the form of a conditional statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and a negation statement \"Mary was not at the wedding\". To determine if we can infer \"Sue was not at the wedding\", we need to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe argument is valid if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In this case, the premises are the conditional statement and the negation statement.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (premise 1)\n2. Mary was not at the wedding (premise 2)\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. However, premise 2 states that Mary was not at the wedding, which means that the condition in premise 1 is not met. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that Sue was not at the wedding. The argument is not valid because the premises do not logically lead to the conclusion.",
