Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if Sue had chosen pizza, Bob would have chosen pasta. However, since Sue did not choose pizza, we cannot conclude that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nIn other words, the second statement only tells us that Sue did not choose pizza, but it doesn't provide any information about Bob's choice. The first statement establishes a conditional relationship between Sue and Bob's choices, but it doesn't allow us to infer anything about Bob's choice given Sue's non-choice of pizza.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Bob did not choose pasta' from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
