It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nNow, let's consider two possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Tom watched football.\n\nIf Tom watched football, then according to premise 1, Jen must have watched basketball. But we know from premise 2 that Jen did not watch basketball. Therefore, this scenario leads to a contradiction, and we can conclude that Tom did not watch football.\n\nScenario 2: Tom did not watch football.\n\nIf Tom did not watch football, then premise 1 does not apply, and we cannot infer anything about Jen's actions. However, we know from premise 2 that Jen did not watch basketball. Therefore, this scenario is consistent with the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer 'Tom did not watch football' from the given premises.",
