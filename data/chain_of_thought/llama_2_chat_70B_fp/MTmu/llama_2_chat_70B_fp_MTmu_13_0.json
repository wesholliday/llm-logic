It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that it's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\n\nIf the truck must have been blue, then the car must have been red (this is a logical deduction based on premise 1).\n\nHowever, since premise 2 states that it's not the case that the truck must have been blue, we can conclude that the car must not have been red.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The car was not red' based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
