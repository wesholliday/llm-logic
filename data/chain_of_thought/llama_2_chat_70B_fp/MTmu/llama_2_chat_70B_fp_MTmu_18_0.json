            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on a conditional statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" The negation of the consequent \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\" is equivalent to \u00ac(the truck must have been metal).\n\nUsing the rule of negation of a conditional, we can infer \u00ac(If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal) which is equivalent to If the doll was plastic, then \u00ac(the truck must have been metal).\n\nNow, we have If the doll was plastic, then \u00ac(the truck must have been metal) and \u00ac(the truck must have been metal). Using the rule of modus tollens, we can infer \u00ac(the doll was plastic).\n\nTherefore, the argument allows us to infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
