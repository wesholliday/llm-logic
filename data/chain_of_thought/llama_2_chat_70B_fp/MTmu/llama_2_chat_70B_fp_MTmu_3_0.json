It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that it's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's consider two possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The book was written by James.\nIn this scenario, the book must be a mystery novel, according to premise 1. However, this contradicts premise 2, which states that it's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel. Therefore, this scenario is impossible.\n\nScenario 2: The book was not written by James.\nIn this scenario, the book need not be a mystery novel, which is consistent with premise 2.\n\nSince scenario 1 is impossible and scenario 2 is possible, we can conclude that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
