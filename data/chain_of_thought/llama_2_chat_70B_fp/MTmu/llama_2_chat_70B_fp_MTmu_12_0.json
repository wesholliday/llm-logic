It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's consider two possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Joe went to the park.\nIf Joe went to the park, then according to premise 1, Lucy must have gone to the zoo. But we know that Lucy did not go to the zoo, so this scenario is impossible.\n\nScenario 2: Joe did not go to the park.\nIf Joe did not go to the park, then premise 1 does not apply, and we have no information about Lucy's whereabouts. However, we know that Lucy did not go to the zoo, so this scenario is consistent with the given premises.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
