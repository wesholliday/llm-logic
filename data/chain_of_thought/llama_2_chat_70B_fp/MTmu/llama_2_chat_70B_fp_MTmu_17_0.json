It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad.\n\nFrom 1, we can infer that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad.\n\nFrom 2, we know that it's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad.\n\nNow, let's consider two possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Ben ate pasta.\nIn this scenario, Kate must have eaten the salad, according to the first statement. However, this contradicts the second statement, which states that it's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad. Therefore, this scenario is impossible.\n\nScenario 2: Ben did not eat pasta.\nIn this scenario, Kate need not have eaten the salad, as the first statement does not apply. This scenario is consistent with both statements, as the second statement only states that Kate need not have eaten the salad.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
