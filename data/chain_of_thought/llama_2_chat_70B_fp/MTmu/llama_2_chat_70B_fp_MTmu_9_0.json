It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nFrom 1, we can infer that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nFrom 2, we know that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's consider two possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Lisa bought the red shirt.\nIn this scenario, Mark must have bought the blue shirt, according to the first statement. However, this contradicts the second statement, which states that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. Therefore, this scenario is impossible.\n\nScenario 2: Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\nIn this scenario, Mark did not buy the blue shirt, which is consistent with the second statement. Therefore, this scenario is possible.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
