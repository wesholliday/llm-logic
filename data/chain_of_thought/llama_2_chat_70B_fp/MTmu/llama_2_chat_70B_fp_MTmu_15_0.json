It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. However, premise 2 states that it's not the case that Erin must have taken a train. This means that the condition in premise 1, \"if Sam took a plane,\" is not satisfied, and therefore the conclusion \"Erin must have taken a train\" does not follow.\n\nIn other words, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane, because if he had, then Erin would have had to take a train, but she did not.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
