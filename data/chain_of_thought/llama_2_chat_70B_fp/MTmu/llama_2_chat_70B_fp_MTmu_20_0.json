            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given premises are:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n2. It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that the apple's redness implies the banana's yellowness. In other words, if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that the banana's yellowness is not necessarily true. In other words, it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the apple was red. If the apple was red, then according to premise 1, the banana must have been yellow. However, since premise 2 states that the banana's yellowness is not necessarily true, we can conclude that the apple's redness does not necessarily imply the banana's yellowness.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the apple was not red, as the apple's redness would have implied the banana's yellowness, which is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
