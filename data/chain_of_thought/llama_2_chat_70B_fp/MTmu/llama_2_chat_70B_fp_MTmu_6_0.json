Sue chose pizza: If Sue chose pizza, then according to the first statement, Bob must have chosen pasta. However, since it's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta, this means that Sue did not choose pizza.\n2. Sue did not choose pizza: If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob's choice is not determined, and he could have chosen either pasta or something else. In this case, the second statement still holds true, as Bob did not have to choose pasta.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
