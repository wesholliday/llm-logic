It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that Sue's attendance at the wedding is not necessarily true.\n\nNow, let's consider two possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Mary was at the wedding.\nIn this scenario, Sue must have been at the wedding, according to premise 1. However, this contradicts premise 2, which states that Sue's attendance at the wedding is not necessarily true. Therefore, this scenario is invalid.\n\nScenario 2: Mary was not at the wedding.\nIn this scenario, Sue's attendance at the wedding is still not necessarily true, according to premise 2. However, this scenario does not contradict either premise, and it is consistent with the information given.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
