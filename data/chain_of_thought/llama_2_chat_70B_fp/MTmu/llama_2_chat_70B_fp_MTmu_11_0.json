It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nIf the muffins must have been blueberry, then the cake must have been chocolate (this is a logical conclusion based on premise 1).\n\nHowever, since premise 2 states that it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry, we can conclude that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
