Alex finished the race - If Alex finished the race, then according to the first statement, Chris must have finished the race too. In this scenario, both Alex and Chris finished the race.\n2. Alex did not finish the race - If Alex did not finish the race, then the first statement does not apply, and we cannot conclude that Chris finished the race. In this scenario, we cannot determine whether Chris finished the race or not.\n\nSince we know that Chris finished the race, we can conclude that the first scenario must be true, meaning that Alex finished the race too. Therefore, we can deduce \"Alex finished the race\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
