To determine if we can deduce \"Sam took a plane\" from the given information, we need to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe argument is valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is \"Sam took a plane\" and the premises are \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" and \"Erin took a train\".\n\nWe can use modus ponens, a rule of inference, to deduce the conclusion from the premises. Modus ponens states that if a conditional statement is true and the antecedent is true, then the consequent must be true. In this case, the conditional statement is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" and the antecedent is \"Erin took a train\". If we assume that the conditional statement is true, then we can deduce that the consequent \"Sam took a plane\" must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can deduce \"Sam took a plane\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
