To deduce \"The vampire was awake\" from these statements, we need to use modus ponens, a rule of inference that allows us to conclude a conditional statement's consequent (in this case, \"the mummy was awake\") given the antecedent ( \"the vampire was awake\") and the premise.\n\nModus ponens:\n\n1. If A, then B\n2. B\n3. Therefore, A\n\nIn this case, A is \"the vampire was awake\" and B is \"the mummy was awake\". We are given that B is true, so we can conclude that A is true, using modus ponens.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
