            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given premises are:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n2. The banana was yellow.\n\nWe need to deduce whether we can conclude that the apple was red.\n\nLet's break down the first premise:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nThis premise implies that the apple's redness is sufficient to conclude that the banana is yellow. In other words, if the apple was red, then the banana must be yellow.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise:\n\n2. The banana was yellow.\n\nThis premise simply states that the banana had the property of being yellow.\n\nTo deduce whether the apple was red, we can use modus ponens, a logical rule that allows us to conclude that if a premise implies another premise, and the latter premise is true, then the former premise must also be true.\n\nIn this case, we can apply modus ponens as follows:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. (premise 1)\n2. The banana was yellow. (premise 2)\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can conclude that:\n\n3. The apple was red.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
