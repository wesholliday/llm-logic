In other words, if the book is a mystery novel, then it must have been written by James.\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can deduce that if the book is a mystery novel and the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. This is a tautology and does not provide any new information.\n\nHowever, we cannot deduce the converse, that if the book is a mystery novel, then it must have been written by James. This would be a hasty generalization, as there could be other authors who write mystery novels.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot deduce \"The book was written by James\".\n\nAnswer: No",
