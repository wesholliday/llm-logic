            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information is in the form of a conditional statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and a separate statement \"The truck was blue\". To determine if we can deduce \"The car was red\" from this information, we need to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe conditional statement implies that the car's color (red) is sufficient to conclude the truck's color (blue). In other words, if the car was red, then the truck must be blue. The separate statement \"The truck was blue\" confirms that the truck's color is indeed blue.\n\nUsing modus ponens, a logical rule of inference, we can conclude that the car was red. Modus ponens states that if a conditional statement is true and the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is true, then the consequent (the \"then\" part) must also be true. In this case, the conditional statement is \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue,\" and the antecedent is \"the car was red.\" Since the consequent \"the truck was blue\" is confirmed to be true, we can infer that the antecedent \"the car was red\" must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can logically deduce \"The car was red.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
