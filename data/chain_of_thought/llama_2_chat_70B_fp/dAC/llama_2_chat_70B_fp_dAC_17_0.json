To deduce \"Ben ate pasta\" from these statements, we need to use modus ponens, a rule of inference that allows us to conclude the antecedent of a conditional statement from the succedent and the premise.\n\nModus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is true, then we can conclude that A is true. In this case, we have the conditional statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" and we know that Kate ate salad. Therefore, we can conclude that Ben ate pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
