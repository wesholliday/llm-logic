The conditional statement is \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This means that if the cake was chocolate, then it is guaranteed that the muffins were blueberry. The premise is \"The muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nTo deduce \"The cake was chocolate\" from the given information, we need to use modus ponens, which is a rule of inference that allows us to conclude a conditional statement's consequent (in this case, \"the muffins were blueberry\") given the antecedent (in this case, \"the cake was chocolate\") and the premise (in this case, \"the muffins were blueberry\").\n\nTherefore, using modus ponens, we can conclude that since the muffins were blueberry (premise), and if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry (conditional statement), it must be the case that the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
