The alien visited Mars.\n\nTo deduce 3 from 1 and 2, we can use modus ponens, which states that if a conditional statement is true, and the antecedent is true, then the consequent must be true.\n\nSo, let's apply modus ponens to 1 and 2:\n\n1. If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. (premise)\n2. The robot visited Jupiter. (premise)\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can deduce:\n\n3. The alien visited Mars. (conclusion)\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
