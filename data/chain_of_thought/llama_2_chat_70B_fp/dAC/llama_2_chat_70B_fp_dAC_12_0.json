To deduce \"Joe went to the park\", we need to use modus ponens, which is a rule of inference that allows us to conclude a conditional statement's antecedent (in this case, \"Joe went to the park\") given the succedent (in this case, \"Lucy went to the zoo\") and the premise (in this case, \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\").\n\nTherefore, we can deduce \"Joe went to the park\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
