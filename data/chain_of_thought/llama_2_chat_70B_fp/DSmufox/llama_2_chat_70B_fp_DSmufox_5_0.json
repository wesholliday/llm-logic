In other words, there is no requirement for the zinger to be smoogled.\n2. \"Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning that one of the two clauses must be true. The first clause, \"the zinger must be smoogled,\" is already known to be false based on the first statement. Therefore, the second clause, \"it is fraggled,\" must be true.\n\nNow, let's put the two statements together:\n\n1. The zinger is not necessarily smoogled (from the first statement).\n2. The zinger must be fraggled (from the second statement).\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
