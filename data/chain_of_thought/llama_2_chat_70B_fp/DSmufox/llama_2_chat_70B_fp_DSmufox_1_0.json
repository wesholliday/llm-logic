In other words, there is no requirement for the flugel to be zargled.\n2. \"Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning that one of the two clauses must be true. The first clause, \"the flugel must be zargled,\" is already known to be false based on the first statement. Therefore, the second clause, \"it is blimmed,\" must be true.\n\nNow, let's put the two statements together:\n\n1. The flugel is not necessarily zargled (but it could be).\n2. The flugel must be blimmed (since it's not zargled).\n\nBased on these two statements, we can conclude that the flugel is indeed blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
