In other words, the possibility of the glip being tragged is denied.\n2. \"Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning that one of the two options must be true. The first option is that the glip must be tragged, which we know is not the case based on the first statement. Therefore, the second option must be true, that is, the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
