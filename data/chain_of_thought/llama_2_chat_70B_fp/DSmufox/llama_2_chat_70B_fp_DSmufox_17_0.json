In other words, the flob can be movated or not movated.\n2. \"Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled\" means that there are only two possibilities for the flob: it must be movated or it is skizzled.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The flob is movated. In this case, the first statement \"It's not the case that the flob must be movated\" is false, because the flob is indeed movated. However, this scenario is impossible because it contradicts the second statement \"Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled\".\n\nScenario 2: The flob is not movated. In this case, the first statement \"It's not the case that the flob must be movated\" is true, because the flob is not movated. Moreover, since the flob is not movated, the second statement \"Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled\" implies that the flob must be skizzled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
