In other words, the smip can be either lupped or shripped.\n2. \"Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped\" means that the smip must be either lupped or shripped, there is no third option.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible cases:\n\n1. If the smip is lupped, then it must be lupped, which contradicts the first statement.\n2. If the smip is shripped, then it is not lupped, which aligns with the first statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
