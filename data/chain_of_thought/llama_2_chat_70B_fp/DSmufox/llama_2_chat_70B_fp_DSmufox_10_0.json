(the wug must be garpled) \u2228 (the wug is sproinged) (from the second premise)\n2. \u00ac(the wug must be garpled) (from the first premise)\n3. \u00ac(the wug must be garpled) \u2228 (the wug is sproinged) (using 1 and 2)\n4. (the wug is sproinged) (using 3 and the disjunctive syllogism rule)\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The wug is sproinged\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
