In other words, the flug could be zimmed, but it's also possible that it's not zimmed.\n2. \"Either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning that one of the two clauses must be true. In this case, we know that the flug is not necessarily zimmed (from the first statement), so the second clause \"it is blummed\" must be true.\n\nNow, let's put the two statements together:\n\n1. The flug is not necessarily zimmed.\n2. Either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can conclude that the flug is blummed. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
