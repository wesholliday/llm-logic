In other words, the quanking of the splat is not a certainty.\n2. \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed\" presents two exclusive options: either the splat must be quanked, or it is morphed.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The splat is quanked. In this case, the first statement \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked\" would be false, as the splat is indeed quanked. This means that this scenario is not possible.\n\nScenario 2: The splat is not quanked. In this case, the first statement \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked\" would be true, as the splat is not quanked. Now, we look at the second statement \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed\". Since the splat is not quanked, the only remaining option is that it is morphed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
