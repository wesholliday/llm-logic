We can do this by using a technique called De Morgan's laws, which allow us to simplify the second premise:\n\n(wug must be bimmed) \u2228 (wug is flooped)\n\nUsing De Morgan's laws, we can rewrite this as:\n\n\u00ac(wug must be bimmed) \u2228 (wug is flooped)\n\nNow, we can simplify the first premise:\n\n\u00ac(wug must be bimmed)\n\nUsing De Morgan's laws again, we can rewrite this as:\n\n(wug must not be bimmed)\n\nNow, we can combine the two simplified statements:\n\n(wug must not be bimmed) \u2228 (wug is flooped)\n\nUsing logical notation, we can rewrite this as:\n\n\u00ac(wug must be bimmed) \u2228 (wug is flooped)\n\nThis statement is logically equivalent to:\n\n(wug is flooped)\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The wug is flooped\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
