(The fleeg must be surned) \u2228 (The fleeg is bluttered) (from the second premise)\n3. \u00ac(The fleeg must be surned) \u2228 (The fleeg is bluttered) (by negating the first premise)\n4. \u00ac(The fleeg must be surned) \u2228 (The fleeg is bluttered) \u2227 \u00ac(The fleeg must be surned) (by conjunction introduction)\n5. (The fleeg is bluttered) (by disjunctive syllogism)\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
