            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a form of modus ponens, which has the following structure:\n\nIf A, then B\nB\nTherefore, A\n\nIn this case, the premise is \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside,\" which can be symbolized as \"If A, then B.\" The conclusion is \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside,\" which can be symbolized as \"Therefore, A.\"\n\nThe argument is logically valid if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the premises and conclusion:\n\nPremise: If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\nConclusion: If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside\n2. Determine the logical relationship between the premises and conclusion:\n\nThe premise and conclusion are contrapositive statements. A contrapositive statement is a statement that is logically equivalent to the original statement, but with the order of the premises reversed. In this case, the premise \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" is logically equivalent to \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside.\"\n3. Check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises:\n\nSince the premise and conclusion are contrapositive statements, it means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
