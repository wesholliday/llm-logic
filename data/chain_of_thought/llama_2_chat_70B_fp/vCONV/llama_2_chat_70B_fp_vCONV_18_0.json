            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a form of modus ponens, which has the following structure:\n\nIf A, then B\nB\nTherefore, A\n\nIn this case, the premise is \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal,\" which can be broken down into two parts:\n\nA: The doll was plastic\nB: The truck was metal\n\nThe conclusion is \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic,\" which is the inverse of the premise.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In other words, if the premise is true, must the conclusion also be true?\n\nIf the premise is true and the doll was indeed plastic, then it logically follows that the truck was metal. Therefore, the conclusion \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic\" is also true.\n\nSo, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
