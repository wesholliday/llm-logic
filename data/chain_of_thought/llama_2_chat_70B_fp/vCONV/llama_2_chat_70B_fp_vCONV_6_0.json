            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the premise being \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" and the conclusion being \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza\". In order to determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the contrapositive of the premise: The contrapositive of \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\".\n2. Negate the conclusion: The negation of \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza\" is \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\".\n3. Show that the negation of the conclusion is equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise:\n\nIf Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza (contrapositive of premise)\nIf Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza (negation of conclusion)\n\nAs we can see, the negation of the conclusion is equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise, which means that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
