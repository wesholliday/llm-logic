            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a form of modus ponens, which has the following structure:\n\nIf A, then B\nB\nTherefore, A\n\nIn this case, the premise is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,\" which can be broken down into two parts:\n\nA: The shirt was cotton\nB: The pants were denim\n\nThe conclusion is \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton,\" which can also be broken down into two parts:\n\nA: The pants were denim\nB: The shirt was cotton\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In other words, if the premise is true, must the conclusion also be true?\n\nIf we assume that the premise is true, then we know that whenever the shirt is cotton, the pants are denim. This means that if the pants are denim, it must be the case that the shirt is cotton. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premise, and the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
