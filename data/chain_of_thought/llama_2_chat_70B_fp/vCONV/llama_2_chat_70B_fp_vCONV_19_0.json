            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional statement, with the premise being \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" and the conclusion being \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football\". In order to determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nTo do this, we can use the concept of contrapositive, which is a statement that is logically equivalent to the original statement, but with the order of the premises reversed. In this case, the contrapositive of the premise would be \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\".\n\nNow, let's assume that the premise is true. If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball, according to the premise. Therefore, if Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football, which is the contrapositive of the premise.\n\nHowever, this implies that the conclusion \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football\" is not necessarily true. If Jen watched basketball, it does not necessarily mean that Tom watched football, as we have already established that the contrapositive of the premise is true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid, as the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: No",
