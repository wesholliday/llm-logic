            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a form of modus ponens, which has the following structure:\n\nIf A, then B\nB\nTherefore, A\n\nIn this case, the premise is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" which can be symbolized as \"If A, then B.\" The conclusion is \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding,\" which can be symbolized as \"Therefore, A.\"\n\nThe validity of this argument depends on whether the premise and conclusion are logically connected. In other words, does the truth of the premise necessarily lead to the truth of the conclusion?\n\nIf we assume that the premise is true, then we know that whenever Mary is at a wedding, Sue is also at that wedding. This means that if Sue was at the wedding, it is guaranteed that Mary was also at the wedding. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
