            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a form of syllogism, with the premise being \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and the conclusion being \"If the truck was blue, then the car was red\". In order to determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nTo do this, we can use the method of substitution, where we replace the conditional statement in the premise with its contrapositive. The contrapositive of \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\".\n\nNow, let's examine the argument again:\n\nPremise: If the car was red, then the truck was blue\nConclusion: If the truck was blue, then the car was red\n\nUsing the method of substitution, we can rewrite the argument as follows:\n\nPremise: If the car was red, then the truck was blue\nConclusion: If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\n\nAs we can see, the conclusion logically follows from the premise. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
