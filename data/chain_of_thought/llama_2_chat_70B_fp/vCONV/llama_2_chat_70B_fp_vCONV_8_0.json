            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a form of modus ponens, which has the following structure:\n\nIf A, then B\nB\nTherefore, A\n\nIn this case, the premise is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" which can be represented as \"A = vampire awake\" and \"B = mummy awake.\" The conclusion is \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake,\" which can be represented as \"If B, then A.\"\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In other words, we need to see if the truth of the conclusion can be deduced from the truth of the premise.\n\nIf the premise is true, then we know that whenever the vampire is awake, the mummy is also awake. This means that if the mummy is awake, it is possible that the vampire is also awake. However, it is also possible that the mummy is awake for reasons unrelated to the vampire's state.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake\" does not logically follow from the premise \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" The argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
