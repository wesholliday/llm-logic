            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the premise \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" and the conclusion \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane\". In order to determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the contrapositive of the premise: The contrapositive of \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane\".\n2. Negate the conclusion: The negation of \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane\" is \"If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane\".\n3. Show that the negation of the conclusion is equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise:\n\nIf Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane (negation of conclusion)\nIf Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane (contrapositive of premise)\n\nAs we can see, the negation of the conclusion is equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise, which means that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
