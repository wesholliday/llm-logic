            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the premise being \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" and the conclusion being \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park\". In order to determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to assess whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the conditional statement in the premise: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\"\n2. Negate the conclusion: \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\"\n3. Determine whether the negated conclusion is true given the premise. In other words, if the premise is true, would the negated conclusion also have to be true?\n\nIf we apply these steps to the argument in question, we get:\n\n1. Conditional statement in the premise: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\"\n2. Negated conclusion: \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\"\n3. Given the premise, if Lucy went to the zoo, it means that Joe went to the park (since the premise states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo). Therefore, the negated conclusion \"Joe did not go to the park\" would be false, given the premise.\n\nSince the negated conclusion is false given the premise, we can conclude that the original argument is logically valid. The conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
