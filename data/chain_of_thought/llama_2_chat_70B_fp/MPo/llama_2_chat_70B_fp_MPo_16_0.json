            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The pants were denim\" from the given statements, we need to evaluate the relationship between the statements using logical reasoning.\n\nThe first statement \"The shirt was cotton\" provides us with information about the material of the shirt, but it doesn't directly relate to the pants.\n\nThe second statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between the shirt and pants. It implies that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim.\n\nUsing modus ponens, a logical rule of inference, we can conclude that the pants were denim because we know that the shirt was cotton. Modus ponens states that if a conditional statement is true and the antecedent (in this case, \"the shirt was cotton\") is true, then the consequent (in this case, \"the pants were denim\") must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can logically infer that the pants were denim.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
