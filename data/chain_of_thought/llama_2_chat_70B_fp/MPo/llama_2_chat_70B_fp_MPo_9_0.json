            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'Mark bought the blue shirt' from the given statements, we need to evaluate the relationship between the two statements. The first statement 'Lisa bought the red shirt' provides us with information about Lisa's purchase, but it doesn't directly relate to Mark's purchase. The second statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement that establishes a causal relationship between Lisa's and Mark's purchases.\n\nThe conditional statement implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. Since we know that Lisa bought the red shirt, we can infer that the condition in the second statement has been satisfied, and therefore, Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
