The second statement, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" provides a conditional relationship between Mary and Sue's presence at the wedding.\n\nThe conditional statement implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must also have been at the wedding. In other words, Sue's presence at the wedding is dependent on Mary's presence.\n\nTherefore, by combining the two statements, we can conclude that Sue was at the wedding, since we know that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
