            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The mummy was awake\" from the given premises, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between the statements.\n\nThe first premise \"The vampire was awake\" does not directly mention the mummy. However, the second premise \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" establishes a conditional relationship between the vampire and mummy's states. Specifically, it implies that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake.\n\nUsing modus ponens, a basic rule of logic, we can infer the conclusion \"The mummy was awake\" from the premises. Modus ponens states that if a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is true, and the antecedent \"A\" is true, then the consequent \"B\" must also be true. In this case, the antecedent \"The vampire was awake\" is true, and the consequent \"The mummy was awake\" logically follows.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
