            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The book is a mystery novel\" from the given statements, we need to evaluate the relationship between the two premises.\n\nThe first premise is \"The book was written by James.\" This statement provides us with information about the author of the book, but it doesn't directly imply anything about the genre of the book.\n\nThe second premise is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This statement is a conditional statement, which means that it expresses a relationship between two events. In this case, the condition is \"the book was written by James,\" and the consequence is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nTo infer \"The book is a mystery novel\" from these premises, we need to use modus ponens, which is a logical rule that allows us to conclude that the consequence follows from the condition. In this case, the condition is \"the book was written by James,\" and the consequence is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer \"The book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
