The second statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between the location of the bear and the location of the wolf.\n\nUsing the second statement, we can infer that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. Since we know that the bear was indeed in the cave, we can conclude that the wolf was in the den.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
