            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The truck was blue\" from the given statements, we need to evaluate the relationship between the statements and the conclusion.\n\nThe first statement \"The car was red\" provides information about the color of the car, but it doesn't mention the truck.\n\nThe second statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck. It states that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue.\n\nUsing modus ponens, a logical rule of inference, we can conclude that the truck was blue, given that the car was red. Modus ponens states that if a conditional statement is true, and the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is true, then the consequent (the \"then\" part) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the truck was blue.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
