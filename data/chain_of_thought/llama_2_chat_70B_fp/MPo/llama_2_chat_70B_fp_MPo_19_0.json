            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"Jen watched basketball\" from the given statements, we need to evaluate the validity of the argument. The argument is formed by combining two premises: \"Tom watched football\" and \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThe first premise \"Tom watched football\" does not provide any information about Jen's actions. The second premise \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is a conditional statement that implies a causal relationship between Tom's action and Jen's action. It suggests that whenever Tom watches football, Jen watches basketball.\n\nTo infer \"Jen watched basketball,\" we need to assume that the conditional statement is true and that Tom indeed watched football. If both premises are true, we can conclude that Jen watched basketball.\n\nTherefore, the argument is valid, and we can infer \"Jen watched basketball\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
