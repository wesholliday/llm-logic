To determine if we can conclude \"Ben ate pasta\", we need to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe conditional statement implies that the occurrence of the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) necessarily leads to the consequence (Kate ate salad). In other words, if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate would not have eaten salad.\n\nGiven that Kate ate salad, we can infer that the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) must be true, as the consequence (Kate ate salad) has been confirmed. In other words, since Kate ate salad, it must be the case that Ben ate pasta.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that Ben ate pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
