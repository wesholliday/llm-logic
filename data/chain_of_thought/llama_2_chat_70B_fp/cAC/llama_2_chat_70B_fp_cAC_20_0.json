            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given premises are:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n2. The banana was yellow.\n\nWe need to determine if we can conclude that the apple was red.\n\nLet's break down the first premise:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nThis premise implies that the apple's redness is sufficient to guarantee the banana's yellowness. In other words, if the apple was red, then the banana must be yellow.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise:\n\n2. The banana was yellow.\n\nThis premise simply states that the banana had the property of being yellow.\n\nTo conclude that the apple was red, we need to use modus ponens, which is a logical rule that allows us to deduce a conclusion from two premises. Modus ponens states that if \"If A, then B\" and \"B\", then we can conclude \"A\".\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nA = The apple was red\nB = The banana was yellow\n\nIf we substitute these values into the modus ponens formula, we get:\n\nIf (The apple was red), then (The banana was yellow)\nThe banana was yellow\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the apple was red.\n\nAnswer:\nYes",
