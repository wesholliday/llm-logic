            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on a conditional statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" which means that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must be denim. The premise \"The pants were denim\" is given.\n\nTo conclude \"The shirt was cotton\" from the given premises, we need to use Modus Ponens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and the antecedent is true, then the consequent must be true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" and the antecedent is \"The pants were denim\". If we assume that the conditional statement is true, then the consequent \"The shirt was cotton\" must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can conclude \"The shirt was cotton\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
