To determine if we can conclude \"Sue chose pizza\", we need to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe conditional statement implies that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob's choice of pasta is a necessary consequence. In other words, if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob would not have chosen pasta.\n\nGiven that Bob chose pasta, we can infer that the condition in the conditional statement (\"Sue chose pizza\") must be true. Therefore, we can conclude that Sue chose pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
