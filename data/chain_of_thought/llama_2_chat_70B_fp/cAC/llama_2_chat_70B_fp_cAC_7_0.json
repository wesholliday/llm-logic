This means that if the antecedent (Alex finishing the race) is true, then the consequent (Chris finishing the race) must also be true.\n\nWe are also given that Chris finished the race. This means that the consequent of the conditional statement is true.\n\nUsing modus ponens, a logical rule of inference, we can conclude that the antecedent (Alex finishing the race) must also be true, given that the consequent (Chris finishing the race) is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
