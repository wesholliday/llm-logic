To determine if we can conclude \"Sam took a plane\", we need to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe argument is valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the premises are the conditional statement and the fact that Erin took a train.\n\nIf we assume that the conditional statement is true, then we can deduce that Sam took a plane. This is because the conditional statement states that whenever Sam takes a plane, Erin takes a train, and we know that Erin took a train. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
