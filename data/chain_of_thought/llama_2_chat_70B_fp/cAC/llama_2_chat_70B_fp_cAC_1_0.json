Sue was at the wedding.\n\nFrom the first premise, we can infer that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. The second premise states that Sue was indeed at the wedding.\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can conclude that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In this case, the conclusion is \"Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
