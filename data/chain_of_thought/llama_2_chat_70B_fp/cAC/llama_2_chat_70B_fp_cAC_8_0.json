The mummy was awake.\n\nThe conclusion we want to draw is:\n3. The vampire was awake.\n\nTo determine whether we can validly conclude 3 from 1 and 2, we can use the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Accept 1 and 2 as premises.\nStep 2: From 1, infer that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\nStep 3: From 2, infer that the mummy was awake.\nStep 4: Use modus ponens (MP) to combine the inferences from Steps 2 and 3, yielding the conclusion that the vampire was awake.\n\nTherefore, the reasoning is valid, and we can conclude that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
