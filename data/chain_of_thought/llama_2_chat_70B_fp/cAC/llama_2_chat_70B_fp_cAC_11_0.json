In other words, if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry.\n\nGiven that the muffins are indeed blueberry, we can infer that the sufficient condition for the muffins to be blueberry (i.e., the cake being chocolate) has been met. Therefore, we can logically conclude that the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
