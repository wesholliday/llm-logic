Jen watched basketball.\n\nWe want to conclude whether Tom watched football.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can deduce that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. Since we know that Jen watched basketball (premise 2), we can infer that Tom watched football.\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude this with certainty without additional information. For example, it's possible that Tom did not watch football, and Jen watched basketball anyway. Therefore, we need more information to confirm whether Tom watched football.\n\nAnswer: No.",
