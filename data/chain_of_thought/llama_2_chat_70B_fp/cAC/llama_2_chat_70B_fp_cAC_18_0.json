The consequent of the statement \"the truck was metal\" is given. To conclude \"the doll was plastic\", we need to use modus ponens, which requires the antecedent of the conditional statement to be true.\n\nThe antecedent of the conditional statement is \"the doll was plastic\". We are not given any information about the doll's material, so we cannot confirm whether the antecedent is true or false. Therefore, we cannot apply modus ponens and conclude \"the doll was plastic\".\n\nAnswer: No",
