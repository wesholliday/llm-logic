This means that if the premise \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true, then the conclusion \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" must also be true.\n\nWe are also given the statement \"Mark bought the blue shirt\", which means that the conclusion of the conditional statement is already true.\n\nTherefore, by modus ponens, we can conclude that the premise \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" must also be true, since the conclusion \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is already true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
