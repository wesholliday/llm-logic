In other words, there is a possibility that the flug was not blummed.\n\nIf we were to infer \"It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed\" from the given statement, we would be implying that the flug's blumming is impossible or ruled out. However, the given statement only suggests that the flum's blumming is not certain or guaranteed, but it does not necessarily rule out the possibility that the flug was blummed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed\" directly from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
