This means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the sneg must have been crampled.\n\nInference is a process of drawing a conclusion based on evidence or premises. In this case, the premise is \"The sneg might not have been crampled,\" and the conclusion we are trying to draw is \"It's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled.\"\n\nIf we were to infer that the sneg must have been crampled based on the premise, we would be making an illogical leap. The premise only suggests that it's possible the sneg wasn't crampled, not that it's impossible for it to have been crampled. Therefore, we cannot infer that the sneg must have been crampled.\n\nAnswer: No",
