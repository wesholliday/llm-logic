This means that the negation of the statement \"The twonk must have been plinked\" is true, since \"must have been\" implies a certainty or necessity that is not present in the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
