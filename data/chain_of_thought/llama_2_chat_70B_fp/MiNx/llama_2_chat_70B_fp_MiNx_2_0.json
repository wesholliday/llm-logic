This means that the negation of the statement \"The wug must have been flooped\" is true, which is equivalent to saying that it's not the case that the wug must have been flooped.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the wug must have been flooped\" from the statement \"The wug might not have been flooped\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
