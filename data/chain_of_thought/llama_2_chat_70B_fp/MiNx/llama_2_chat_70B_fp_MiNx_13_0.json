This means that the negation of the statement \"The glip must have been slogged\" is true, which is equivalent to saying that it's not the case that the glip must have been slogged.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged\" from the statement \"The glip might not have been slogged\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
