This means that we cannot say for certain whether the shank has been plooked or not.\n\nIf we cannot say for certain whether the shank has been plooked, then we also cannot say for certain that the shank must have been plooked. The possibility that the shank might not have been plooked implies that there is a chance that it has not been plooked, which means that we cannot infer that it must have been plooked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the shank must have been plooked\" from \"The shank might not have been plooked\".\n\nAnswer: No",
