This means that the negation of the statement \"The sprocket must have been cranked\" is true.\n\nIn other words, if it's possible that the sprocket was not cranked, then it's not necessarily the case that the sprocket must have been cranked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been cranked\" from \"The sprocket might not have been cranked\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
