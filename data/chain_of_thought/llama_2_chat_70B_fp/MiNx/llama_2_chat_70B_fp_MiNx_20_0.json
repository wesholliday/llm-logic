            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered\" implies that the bluttering of the fleeg is not certain or guaranteed. It leaves open the possibility that the fleeg might have been bluttered, but also allows for the possibility that it might not have been bluttered.\n\nIn order to infer \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered\" from the given statement, we need to consider the contrapositive of the statement. The contrapositive of \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered\" is \"It's not the case that the fleeg must not have been bluttered.\"\n\nSince the contrapositive is a negation of the original statement, we can infer that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must be false. Therefore, if \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered\" is true, then \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered\" must be false, and we can conclude that the fleeg must have been bluttered.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
