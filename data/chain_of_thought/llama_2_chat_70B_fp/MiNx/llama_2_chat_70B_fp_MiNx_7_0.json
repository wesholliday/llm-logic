This means that the negation of the statement \"The whiffle must have been shanked\" is true, which is equivalent to saying that it's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked\" from the statement \"The whiffle might not have been shanked\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
