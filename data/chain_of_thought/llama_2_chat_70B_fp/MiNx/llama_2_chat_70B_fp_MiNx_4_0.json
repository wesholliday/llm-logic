This means that the negation of the statement \"The fribble must have been snurgled\" is true.\n\nIn other words, if we say \"The fribble might not have been snurgled\", we are acknowledging that there is a possibility that the fribble was not snurgled, which means that it is not necessary that the fribble must have been snurgled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled\" from \"The fribble might not have been snurgled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
