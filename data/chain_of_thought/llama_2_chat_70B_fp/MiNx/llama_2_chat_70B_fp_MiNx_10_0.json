In other words, there is a possibility that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nIf we were to infer \"It's not the case that the wug must have been sproinged\" from the given statement, we would be implying that the wug's sproinging is impossible or ruled out. However, the given statement only suggests that the wug's sproinging is not certain or guaranteed, but it does not necessarily rule out the possibility of the wug being sproinged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the wug must have been sproinged\" directly from \"The wug might not have been sproinged\".\n\nAnswer: No",
