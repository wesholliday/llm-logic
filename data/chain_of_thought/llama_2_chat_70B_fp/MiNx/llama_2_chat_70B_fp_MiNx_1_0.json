This means that the blimming of the flugel is not a certainty, and there is a chance that it might not have happened.\n\nFrom this statement, we can infer that it's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed. The word \"must\" implies a necessity or certainty, which is not present in the original statement. Instead, the statement suggests a possibility or uncertainty, which means that it's not necessary for the flugel to have been blimmed.\n\nAnswer: No.",
