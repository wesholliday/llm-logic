If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer the conclusion \"The sprocket was daggled\" based on the given premises.\n\nThe first premise states that the sprocket was cranked. The second premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the sprocket was cranked) is true, then the conclusion (the sprocket was daggled) must also be true.\n\nSince the first premise states that the sprocket was cranked, we can conclude that the condition of the second premise is satisfied, and therefore, the conclusion of the second premise must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the sprocket was daggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
