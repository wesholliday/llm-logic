The first premise is \"The grommet was sploffed\", and the second premise is \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\".\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can deduce the conclusion \"The grommet plopped the frink\" as follows:\n\n1. The grommet was sploffed (given)\n2. If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink (given)\n3. Therefore, the grommet plopped the frink (conclusion)\n\nAnswer: Yes",
