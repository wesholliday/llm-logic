If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n\nWe need to determine whether we can infer the conclusion \"The fleeg surned\" from these premises.\n\nLet's break down the second premise: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\" This premise states that the condition of the fleeg being bluttered is sufficient to conclude that it surned. In other words, if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have surned.\n\nNow, let's consider the first premise: \"The fleeg was bluttered.\" This premise states that the fleeg was indeed bluttered.\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can conclude that if the fleeg was bluttered and if the fleeg being bluttered implies that it surned, then we can infer that the fleeg surned.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer \"The fleeg surned.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
