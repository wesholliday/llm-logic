Either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that the jacket might not be hanging in the closet, but we cannot conclude that it is not hanging in the closet.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that the jacket must be either hanging in the closet or draped over the chair. Since we have already established that the jacket might not be hanging in the closet, the only remaining option is that it is draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
