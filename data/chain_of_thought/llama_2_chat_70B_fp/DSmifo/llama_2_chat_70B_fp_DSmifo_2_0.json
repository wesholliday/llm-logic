The second premise, \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf,\" provides two exclusive options for the book's location: the table or the shelf.\n\nIf the book is not resting on the table, then it must be on the shelf, as there are no other options available. Therefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
