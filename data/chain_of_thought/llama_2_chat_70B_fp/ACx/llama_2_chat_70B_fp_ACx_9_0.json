The twonk was varnished.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The twonk was plinked\" from these premises.\n\nLet's break down the first premise:\n\n1. If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\n\nThis premise states that if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished. In other words, the condition of being plinked implies the condition of being varnished.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise:\n\n2. The twonk was varnished.\n\nThis premise states that the twonk was indeed varnished.\n\nUsing modus ponens, a logical rule of inference, we can conclude that if the twonk was varnished, and being varnished implies being plinked, then the twonk must have been plinked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The twonk was plinked\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
