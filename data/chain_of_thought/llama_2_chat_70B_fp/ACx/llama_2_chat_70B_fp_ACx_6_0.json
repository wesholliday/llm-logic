            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on a conditional statement \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\" The consequent of the conditional statement is \"the grommet plopped the frink.\" We are given the information that \"the grommet plopped the frink.\" Our task is to determine whether we can infer \"the grommet was sploffed\" from the given information.\n\nTo do this, we need to assess the validity of the argument. The argument is valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the premise is \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink,\" and the conclusion is \"the grommet was sploffed.\"\n\nWe can use modus ponens, a rule of inference that allows us to deduce the conclusion of a conditional statement from its premises, to determine the validity of the argument. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B,\" and we know that B is true, we can infer that A is true.\n\nIn this case, we have the conditional statement \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\" We know that the consequent \"the grommet plopped the frink\" is true. Therefore, we can use modus ponens to infer that the antecedent \"the grommet was sploffed\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
