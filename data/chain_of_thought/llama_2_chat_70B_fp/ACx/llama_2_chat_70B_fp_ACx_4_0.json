A conditional statement is valid if and only if its conclusion follows logically from its premises. In this case, the conclusion is \"the fribble crinked,\" and the premise is \"the fribble was snurgled.\"\n\nIf we assume that the conclusion is true, \"the fribble crinked,\" we can deduce that the premise must also be true, \"the fribble was snurgled.\" This is because the conditional statement implies a causal relationship between the premise and the conclusion. In other words, the premise (the fribble was snurgled) leads to the conclusion (the fribble crinked).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"the fribble was snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
