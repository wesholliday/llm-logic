            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on a conditional statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" and a premise \"The sprocket was daggled\". We need to determine if we can infer \"The sprocket was cranked\" from these two pieces of information.\n\nThe conditional statement implies that cranking the sprocket is sufficient to result in the sprocket being daggled. In other words, if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled. The premise states that the sprocket was indeed daggled.\n\nUsing modus ponens, a logical rule that allows us to deduce a conclusion from a premise and a conditional statement, we can infer that the sprocket was cranked. Modus ponens states that if \"If A then B\" and \"B\", then \"A\". In this case, A is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and B is \"the sprocket was daggled\".\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the sprocket was cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
