The wug was flooped.\n\nTo infer 3 from 1 and 2, we can use modus ponens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and the antecedent is true, then the consequent must be true. In this case, the conditional statement is 1, and the antecedent is 2.\n\nSo, we can deduce 3 as follows:\n\n1. If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint. (premise)\n2. The wug bimmed the zoint. (premise)\n3. Therefore, the wug was flooped. (conclusion)\n\nAnswer: yes",
