Modus Ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and the premise \"B\", we can infer \"A\".\n\nIn this case, A is \"The zinger was fraggled\" and B is \"The zinger was smoogled\". We have the premise \"The zinger was smoogled\" and the conditional statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\". Therefore, we can use Modus Ponens to infer \"The zinger was fraggled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
