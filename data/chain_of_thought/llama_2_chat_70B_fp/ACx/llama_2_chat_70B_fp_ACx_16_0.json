The sneg sproted the frink.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The sneg was crampled,\" we need to evaluate the relationship between the two statements.\n\nStatement 1 is a conditional statement, meaning that the consequent (the sneg sproted the frink) follows logically from the antecedent (the sneg was crampled) if the antecedent is true.\n\nStatement 2 asserts that the consequent (the sneg sproted the frink) is true.\n\nUsing modus ponens, a logical rule of inference, we can conclude that the antecedent (the sneg was crampled) must be true, given that the consequent (the sneg sproted the frink) is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The sneg was crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
