To determine if we can infer \"The dreb was vroombed\", we need to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe conditional statement implies that the condition \"the dreb was vroombed\" is sufficient to conclude that \"the dreb was spened\". In other words, if the dreb was vroombed, then it must have been spened.\n\nGiven the premise \"The dreb was spened\", we can conclude that the condition \"the dreb was vroombed\" has been satisfied, since the dreb was indeed spened. Therefore, we can infer that the dreb was vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
