            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on the following premises:\n\n1. If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\n2. The splat quanked.\n\nWe want to infer whether the splat was morphed.\n\nLet's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\n\nThis premise states that if the splat was morphed, then it necessarily follows that the splat quanked. In other words, the morphing of the splat is sufficient to guarantee that the splat quanked.\n\n2. The splat quanked.\n\nThis premise simply states that the splat quanked.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion:\n\nConclusion: The splat was morphed.\n\nTo infer the conclusion, we need to use modus ponens, which states that if A implies B, and B is true, then A must be true. In this case, A is \"the splat was morphed\" and B is \"the splat quanked\".\n\nSo, we can use modus ponens to infer that the splat was morphed, since we know that the splat quanked and that the splat being morphed implies that it quanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
