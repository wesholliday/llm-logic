If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that the flob might not have moved, which means it's possible that the flob did not move.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that if the flob was skizzled, then it must have moved. This means that if the flob was skizzled, we would know that it moved.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the flob was not skizzled. If the flob was not skizzled, then it's possible that it did not move, based on premise 1. However, if the flob was not skizzled and it did not move, then it would not have been skizzled, which contradicts premise 2.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can infer that the flob was not skizzled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
