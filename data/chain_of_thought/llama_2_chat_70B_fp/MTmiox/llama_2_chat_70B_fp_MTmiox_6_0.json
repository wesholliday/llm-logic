If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that the grommet might not have plopped the frink, but we cannot conclude that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nFrom premise 2, we can infer that if the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink. However, this premise does not provide any information about whether the grommet was actually sploffed or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we cannot infer 'The grommet was not sploffed'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
