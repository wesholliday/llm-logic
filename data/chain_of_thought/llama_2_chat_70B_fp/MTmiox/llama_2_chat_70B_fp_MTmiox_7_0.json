If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that the whiffle might not have tinked, which means it's possible that the whiffle did not tink.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that if the whiffle was shanked, then it must have tinked. This means that if the whiffle was shanked, we would know that it tinked.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the whiffle was shanked. If the whiffle was shanked, then according to premise 2, it must have tinked. However, we know from premise 1 that the whiffle might not have tinked. This means that the possibility that the whiffle was shanked and did not tink is not consistent with the given premises.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the whiffle was not shanked, as the possibility that it was shanked and did not tink is not consistent with the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
