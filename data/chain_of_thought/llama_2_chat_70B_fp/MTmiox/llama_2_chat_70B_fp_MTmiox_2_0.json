If the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that the wug might not have bimmed the zoint, but we cannot conclude that the wug did not bim the zoint.\n\nFrom premise 2, we can infer that if the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint. This means that if the wug was flooped, we can conclude that the wug did bim the zoint.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the wug was not flooped. If the wug was not flooped, then premise 2 does not apply, and we cannot conclude that the wug bimmed the zoint. However, we still have premise 1, which tells us that the wug might not have bimmed the zoint. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the wug did not bim the zoint.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The wug was not flooped' from the given premises.",
