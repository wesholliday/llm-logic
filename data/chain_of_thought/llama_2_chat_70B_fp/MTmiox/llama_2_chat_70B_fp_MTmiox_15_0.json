            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe first premise 'The dreb might not have been spened' implies that the dreb's state of being spened is uncertain or undetermined.\n\nThe second premise 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened' establishes a conditional relationship between the dreb's state of being vroombed and its state of being spened. Specifically, if the dreb was vroombed, then it must have been spened.\n\nTo infer 'The dreb was not vroombed', we can use modus tollens, a form of logical reasoning that involves denying the consequent of a conditional statement to conclude the negation of the antecedent.\n\nIn this case, we can deny the consequent of the second premise ('the dreb must have been spened') to conclude that the antecedent ('the dreb was vroombed') is false. Therefore, we can infer that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
