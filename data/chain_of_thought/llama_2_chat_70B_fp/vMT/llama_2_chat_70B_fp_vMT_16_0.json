            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a modus tollens argument, which has the following form:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nNot Q.\nTherefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim\". The first premise states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. The second premise states that the pants were not denim. The conclusion is that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, must the conclusion also be true?\n\nLet's assume that the first premise is true. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. This means that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise. The pants were not denim. This means that the pants were not denim, regardless of whether the shirt was cotton or not.\n\nNow, let's combine the two premises. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim, but the pants were not denim. This means that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
