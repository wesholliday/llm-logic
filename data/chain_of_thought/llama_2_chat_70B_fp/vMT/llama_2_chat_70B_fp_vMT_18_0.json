            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its structure and see if it follows a valid pattern of reasoning. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n2. The truck was not metal.\n3. Therefore, the doll was not plastic.\n\nThis argument is an example of a modus tollens argument, which has the following form:\n\n1. If A, then B.\n2. Not B.\n3. Therefore, not A.\n\nModus tollens is a valid form of argument, as it follows the rule of logical reasoning that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. In this case, the first premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. The second premise states that the truck was not metal. Based on these premises, we can logically conclude that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid.",
