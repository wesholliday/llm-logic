            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its structure and see if it follows a valid pattern. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n2. The mummy was not awake.\n3. Therefore, the vampire was not awake.\n\nThis argument follows the pattern of a modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens consists of three parts:\n\n1. If A, then B.\n2. Not B.\n3. Therefore, not A.\n\nIn this case, the argument's first premise is the \"if A, then B\" part, and the second premise is the \"not B\" part. The conclusion logically follows from these premises, making the argument valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
