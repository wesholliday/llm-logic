            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its structure and see if it follows a valid pattern. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n2. The truck was not blue.\n3. Therefore, the car was not red.\n\nThis argument is an example of a modus tollens argument, which has the following structure:\n\n1. If A, then B.\n2. Not B.\n3. Therefore, not A.\n\nModus tollens is a valid form of argument, as it follows the rule of logical inference. The first premise establishes a conditional relationship between A and B, and the second premise negates B. The conclusion logically follows from the premises, as if B is false, then the conditional statement that A implies B must also be false.\n\nTherefore, the argument \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\", \"The truck was not blue\", and \"The car was not red\" is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
