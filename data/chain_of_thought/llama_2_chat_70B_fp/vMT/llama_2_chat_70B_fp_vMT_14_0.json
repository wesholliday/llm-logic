The argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n2. The wolf was not in the den.\n3. Therefore, the bear was not in the cave.\n\nThis argument is an example of a modus tollens argument, which has the following structure:\n\n1. If A, then B.\n2. Not B.\n3. Therefore, not A.\n\nModus tollens is a valid form of argument, as it follows the rule of logical inference. The conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
