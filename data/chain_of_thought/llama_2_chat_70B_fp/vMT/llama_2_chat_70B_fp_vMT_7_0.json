            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a type of modus tollens argument, which has the following form:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nNot Q.\nTherefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"Alex finished the race\" and Q is \"Chris finished the race\". The first premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. The second premise states that Chris did not finish the race. The conclusion is that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, is it necessarily true that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true?\n\nLet's assume that the first premise is true. If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This means that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race either.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise. Chris did not finish the race. This means that the condition stated in the first premise, \"if Alex finished the race,\" is not met. Therefore, we can conclude that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can see that the conclusion logically follows from the premises. If the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
