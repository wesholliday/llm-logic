The argument is saying that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow, but since the banana was not yellow, it follows that the apple was not red.\n\nThe modus tollens argument is logically valid, as it follows the correct form of modus tollens. The first premise establishes a conditional relationship between P and Q, and the second premise denies the consequent (Q), which allows us to conclude that the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
