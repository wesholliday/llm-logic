            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its structure and see if it follows a valid pattern. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n2. The unicorn was not in the forest.\n3. Therefore, the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nThis argument is an example of a modus tollens argument, which has the following form:\n\n1. If A, then B.\n2. Not B.\n3. Therefore, not A.\n\nThe modus tollens argument is logically valid, as it follows the rule of logical inference. The first premise establishes a conditional relationship between A and B, and the second premise negates B. By modus tollens, we can conclude that not A.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
