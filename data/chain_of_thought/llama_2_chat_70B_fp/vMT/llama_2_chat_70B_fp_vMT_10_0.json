            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its structure and see if it follows a valid pattern. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n2. The cat was not outside.\n3. Therefore, the dog was not inside.\n\nThis argument is an example of a modus tollens argument, which has the following form:\n\n1. If A, then B.\n2. Not B.\n3. Therefore, not A.\n\nModus tollens is a valid form of argument, as it follows the logical principle of contraposition. In this case, the argument's first premise states that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. The second premise states that the cat was not outside. Using modus tollens, we can conclude that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
