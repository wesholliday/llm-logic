            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a modus tollens argument, which has the following form:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nNot Q.\nTherefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin took a train\". The first premise states that if P is true, then Q must also be true. The second premise states that Q is not true. Therefore, the conclusion is that P is not true, which means that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nThe modus tollens argument is logically valid, as it follows the correct form of modus tollens. The first premise establishes a conditional relationship between P and Q, and the second premise denies the consequent (Q). Therefore, the conclusion logically follows that the antecedent (P) cannot be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
