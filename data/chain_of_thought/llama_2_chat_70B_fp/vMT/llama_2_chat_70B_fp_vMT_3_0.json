            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its structure and premises. The argument is of the form:\n\nIf A, then B\nNot B\nTherefore, not A\n\nWhere A is \"the book was written by James\" and B is \"the book is a mystery novel\".\n\nThe first premise \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (A) is true, then the consequent (B) must also be true.\n\nThe second premise \"The book is not a mystery novel\" is a negation of the consequent (B) of the first premise.\n\nThe conclusion \"The book was not written by James\" is a negation of the antecedent (A) of the first premise.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes, the argument is logically valid.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel (first premise).\n2. It is not a mystery novel (second premise).\n3. Therefore, it was not written by James (conclusion).\n\nThe argument follows the logical form of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. The first premise establishes a conditional relationship between A and B, and the second premise negates the consequent (B), which leads to the conclusion that the antecedent (A) must also be false. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.",
