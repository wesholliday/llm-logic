            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a type of syllogism, with the following structure:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n2. Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n3. Therefore, Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we can use the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the contrapositive of the first premise.\nThe contrapositive of \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nStep 2: Negate the second premise.\nThe negation of \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nStep 3: Replace the second premise with its negation in the argument.\nThe modified argument now looks like this:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n2. Mark bought the blue shirt.\n3. Therefore, Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the modified argument.\nThe modified argument is logically valid, as the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the original argument is also logically valid, since it has the same conclusion as the modified argument.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
