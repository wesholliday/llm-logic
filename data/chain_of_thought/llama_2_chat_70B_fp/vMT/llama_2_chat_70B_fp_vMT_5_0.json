            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a modus tollens argument, which has the following form:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nNot Q.\nTherefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis\". The first premise states that if P is true, then Q must also be true. The second premise states that Q is false. Therefore, the conclusion is that P must also be false, which means that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nThe modus tollens argument is logically valid, as it follows the correct form of modus tollens. The first premise establishes a conditional relationship between P and Q, and the second premise denies the consequent (Q), which allows us to conclude that the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
