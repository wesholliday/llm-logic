            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a modus tollens argument, which has the following form:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nNot Q.\nTherefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"the alien visited Mars\" and Q is \"the robot visited Jupiter\". The first premise states that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. The second premise states that the robot did not visit Jupiter. The conclusion is that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, we need to see if it is impossible for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true.\n\nIf the first premise is true, then the conclusion cannot be false, because if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter, and since the robot did not visit Jupiter, it is impossible for the alien to have visited Mars.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, because if the premises are true, it is impossible for the conclusion to be false.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
