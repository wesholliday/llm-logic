            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its structure and see if it follows a valid pattern. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n2. Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n3. Therefore, Joe did not go to the park.\n\nThis argument is an example of a conditional argument, where the first premise establishes a conditional relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo. The second premise states that Lucy did not go to the zoo, which means that the condition in the first premise is not met. Therefore, we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nThe argument follows the pattern of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argumentation. Modus tollens involves denying the consequent (Lucy going to the zoo) and concluding that the antecedent (Joe going to the park) is false. In this case, the argument is logically valid because if the premises are true, the conclusion necessarily follows.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
