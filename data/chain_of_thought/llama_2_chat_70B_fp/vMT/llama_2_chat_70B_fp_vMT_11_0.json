            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its structure and see if it follows a valid pattern. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n2. The muffins were not blueberry.\n3. Therefore, the cake was not chocolate.\n\nThis argument is an example of a modus tollens argument, which has the following form:\n\n1. If A, then B.\n2. Not B.\n3. Therefore, not A.\n\nThe modus tollens argument is logically valid, as it follows the rule of logical inference. The first premise establishes a conditional relationship between A and B, and the second premise negates B. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows that not A.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
