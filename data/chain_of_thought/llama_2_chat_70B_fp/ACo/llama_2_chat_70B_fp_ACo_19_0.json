In other words, if Tom did not watch football, then it is not necessary that Jen watched basketball.\n\nTherefore, if we know that Jen watched basketball, we can infer that the condition in the conditional statement (\"Tom watched football\") must be true, and thus Tom did watch football.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
