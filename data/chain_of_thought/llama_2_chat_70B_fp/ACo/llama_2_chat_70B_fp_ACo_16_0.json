In other words, if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\n\nNow, let's consider the first statement: the pants were denim. This statement alone does not provide enough information to determine whether the shirt was cotton or not. However, when combined with the second statement, we can use modus ponens to deduce that the shirt must have been cotton, since the pants are denim.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
