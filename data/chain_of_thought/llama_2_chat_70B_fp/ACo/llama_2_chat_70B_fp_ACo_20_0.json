If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer the statement \"The apple was red\" from these premises.\n\nLet's break down the second premise: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This statement is a conditional, which means that the conclusion (\"the banana was yellow\") follows logically from the premise (\"the apple was red\") if the premise is true.\n\nNow, let's consider the first premise: \"The banana was yellow.\" This statement is a simple assertion, and it doesn't provide any information about the color of the apple.\n\nUsing the second premise, we can infer that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, we don't know if the apple was actually red, so we can't conclude that the banana was yellow because of the second premise alone.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The apple was red\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No.",
