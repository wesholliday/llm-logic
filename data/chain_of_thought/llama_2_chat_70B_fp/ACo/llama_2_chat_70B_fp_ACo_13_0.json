            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information is in the form of a conditional statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and a separate statement \"The truck was blue\".\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The car was red\" from the given information, we need to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe argument is valid if the premises are true and the conclusion logically follows from them. In this case, the premises are \"The truck was blue\" and \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\".\n\nIf we assume that the premises are true, we can deduce the conclusion \"The car was red\" by modus ponens, which states that if \"If A then B\" and \"B\" are true, then \"A\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The car was red\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
