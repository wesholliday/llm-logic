To determine if we can infer \"Ben ate pasta\", we need to evaluate the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe conditional statement implies that the occurrence of \"Kate ate salad\" is a consequence of \"Ben ate pasta\". In other words, if \"Ben ate pasta\" is true, then \"Kate ate salad\" must also be true.\n\nGiven that \"Kate ate salad\" is indeed true, we can conclude that the condition in the conditional statement (\"Ben ate pasta\") must also be true. In other words, since Kate ate salad, it means that Ben must have eaten pasta.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer \"Ben ate pasta\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
