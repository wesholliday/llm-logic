If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the wolf was in the den.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. This means that if the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the bear was not in the cave. If the bear was not in the cave, then according to statement 2, the wolf was not in the den. But we know from statement 1 that the wolf was in the den, so this possibility is contradictory.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility left is that the bear was in the cave.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
