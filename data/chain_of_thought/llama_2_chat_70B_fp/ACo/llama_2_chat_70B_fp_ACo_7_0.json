If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that Chris finished the race.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This means that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\n\nNow, let's consider two possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Alex finished the race.\nIn this scenario, premise 2 tells us that Chris finished the race. Therefore, we can conclude that Chris finished the race.\n\nScenario 2: Alex did not finish the race.\nIn this scenario, premise 2 tells us that Chris did not finish the race. This means that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nSince both scenarios lead to the conclusion that Chris finished the race, we can infer that Alex finishes the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
