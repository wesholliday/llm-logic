This means that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt, according to the second statement. But we know that Mark did buy the blue shirt, so this possibility is inconsistent with the information given.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent possibility is that Lisa did buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
