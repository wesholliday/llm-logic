            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information is in the form of a conditional statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" and a separate statement \"Chris finished the race\".\n\nTo deduce whether \"Alex finished the race\" can be logically deduced from the given information, we need to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe argument is valid if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is \"Alex finished the race\" and the premises are \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" and \"Chris finished the race\".\n\nWe can use modus ponens, a rule of inference, to deduce the conclusion from the premises. Modus ponens states that if \"If A then B\" and \"B\" are true, then \"A\" must be true.\n\nIn this case, \"A\" is \"Alex finished the race\" and \"B\" is \"Chris finished the race\". The first premise \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" states that if \"A\" is true, then \"B\" must be true. The second premise \"Chris finished the race\" states that \"B\" is true.\n\nTherefore, using modus ponens, we can deduce that \"A\" (Alex finished the race) must be true, given that \"B\" (Chris finished the race) is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
