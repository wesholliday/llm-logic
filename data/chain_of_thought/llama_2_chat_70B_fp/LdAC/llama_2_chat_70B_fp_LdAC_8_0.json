In this case, the conclusion is \"The vampire was awake\" and the premises are \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" and \"The mummy was awake.\"\n\nWe can use the following steps to evaluate the argument:\n\n1. Assume that the vampire was awake.\n2. From the first premise, we know that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n3. From the second premise, we know that the mummy was awake.\n4. Therefore, if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake, and since the mummy was awake, it means that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
