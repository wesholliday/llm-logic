To determine if we can logically deduce \"Jeff played basketball\", we need to evaluate the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe conditional statement implies that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This means that if we know that Amy played tennis, we can infer that Jeff played basketball.\n\nThe separate statement \"Amy played tennis\" confirms that Amy indeed played tennis. Therefore, using the information from the conditional statement, we can deduce that Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
