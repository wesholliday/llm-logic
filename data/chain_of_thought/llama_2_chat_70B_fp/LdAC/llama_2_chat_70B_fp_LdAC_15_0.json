To determine if we can logically deduce \"Sam took a plane\", we need to evaluate the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe conditional statement implies that if Sam took a plane, then Erin taking a train is a consequence of that action. In other words, if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin would not have taken a train.\n\nGiven that Erin took a train, we can infer that the condition in the conditional statement must have been met, meaning Sam took a plane.\n\nTherefore, we can logically deduce \"Sam took a plane\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
