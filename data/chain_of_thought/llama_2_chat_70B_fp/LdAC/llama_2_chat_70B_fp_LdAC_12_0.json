To deduce whether we can logically deduce \"Joe went to the park\" from this information, we need to evaluate the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe conditional statement implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. This means that if we know that Lucy went to the zoo, we can infer that Joe went to the park. In other words, the truth of the conditional statement implies the truth of its consequent (Joe went to the park).\n\nTherefore, given the additional statement \"Lucy went to the zoo\", we can logically deduce that Joe went to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
