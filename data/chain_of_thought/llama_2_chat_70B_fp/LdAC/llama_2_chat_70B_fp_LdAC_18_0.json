            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on a conditional statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" The conditional statement implies that the doll being plastic is sufficient to conclude that the truck is metal.\n\nGiven the additional premise \"The truck was metal,\" we can infer that the antecedent of the conditional statement \"The doll was plastic\" must be true. In other words, since the truck is metal, it follows that the doll must be plastic.\n\nTherefore, we can logically deduce \"The doll was plastic\" from the two premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
