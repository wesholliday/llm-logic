            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given premises are:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n2. The banana was yellow.\n\nWe need to determine if we can logically deduce \"The apple was red\" from these premises.\n\nLet's break down the first premise: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This statement implies that the apple's redness is sufficient to conclude that the banana is yellow. In other words, if the apple was red, then the banana must be yellow.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise: \"The banana was yellow.\" This statement tells us that the banana had the property of being yellow.\n\nUsing modus ponens, a logical rule of inference, we can conclude that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. Modus ponens states that if \"If A, then B\" and \"B,\" then \"A.\"\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nA = The apple was red\nB = The banana was yellow\n\nIf we substitute these values into the modus ponens formula, we get:\n\nIf (The apple was red), then (The banana was yellow)\nThe banana was yellow\n\nTherefore, we can logically deduce:\n\nThe apple was red\n\nAnswer: Yes",
