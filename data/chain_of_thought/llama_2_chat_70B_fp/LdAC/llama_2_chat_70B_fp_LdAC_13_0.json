            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information is in the form of a conditional statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and a separate statement \"The truck was blue\". To determine if we can logically deduce \"The car was red\", we need to evaluate the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe conditional statement implies that the car's color (red) is sufficient to conclude that the truck's color (blue) is true. In other words, if the car was red, then the truck must be blue.\n\nGiven that the truck was blue, we can infer that the condition in the conditional statement must have been met, meaning the car must have been red.\n\nTherefore, we can logically deduce \"The car was red\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
