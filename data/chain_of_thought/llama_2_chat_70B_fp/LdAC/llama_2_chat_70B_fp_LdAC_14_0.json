The wolf was in the den.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can deduce that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. However, we don't know whether the bear was actually in the cave or not.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that the wolf was in the den. This means that the condition in premise 1 that states \"if the bear was in the cave\" is not met, since we know that the wolf was in the den. Therefore, we cannot logically deduce that the bear was in the cave.\n\nAnswer: No.",
