(This means that if Alex finished, Chris must have finished too.)\n* Chris might not have finished the race. (This means that it's possible that Chris did not finish the race.)\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. Alex finished the race:\n\t* If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race too, according to the first statement.\n\t* But the second statement says that Chris might not have finished the race, which means that Alex's finishing the race doesn't necessarily mean that Chris finished.\n2. Alex did not finish the race:\n\t* If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris might still have finished the race.\n\t* But the first statement says that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished too, which means that if Alex didn't finish, Chris couldn't have finished either.\n\nNow, let's summarize our findings:\n\n* If Alex finished the race, then Chris might not have finished the race.\n* If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris might have finished the race.\n\nSo, can we infer that Alex did not finish the race?\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that Alex did not finish the race. The information provided does not allow us to make a definitive conclusion about Alex's participation in the race.",
