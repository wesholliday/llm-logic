            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" is a conditional statement. It implies that the color of the banana is dependent on the color of the apple. If the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. However, the statement also mentions that the banana might not have been yellow, which means that the color of the banana is not necessarily determined by the color of the apple.\n\nThe statement does not provide enough information to infer the color of the apple. The fact that the banana might not have been yellow means that the apple could have been red, or it could have been a different color altogether. Without additional information, we cannot conclude that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: No.",
