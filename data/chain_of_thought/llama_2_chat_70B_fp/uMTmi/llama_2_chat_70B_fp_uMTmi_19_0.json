This means that if ~F, then ~B (i.e., if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball).\n\nFrom the second premise, we know that Jen might not have watched basketball. This means that ~B is possible.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibilities:\n\n1. ~F: If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball (from the first premise). In this case, ~B is true, which means that Jen might not have watched basketball (from the second premise).\n2. F: If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball (from the first premise). In this case, B is true, which means that Jen did watch basketball. However, this contradicts the second premise, which states that Jen might not have watched basketball. Therefore, this possibility is rejected.\n\nGiven the above analysis, we can infer that Tom did not watch football (~F).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
