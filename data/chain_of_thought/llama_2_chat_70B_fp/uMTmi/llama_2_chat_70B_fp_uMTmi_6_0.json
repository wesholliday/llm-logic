Bob might not have chosen pasta.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob's choice is determined, and he must have chosen pasta.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Bob might not have chosen pasta. This means that there is a possibility that Bob did not choose pasta, and his choice is not determined.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer that Sue did not choose pizza?\n\nIf Sue did choose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta, according to statement 1. However, since Bob might not have chosen pasta, it's possible that Sue did not choose pizza, and Bob did not choose pasta either.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that Sue did not choose pizza. The possibility that Sue chose pizza and Bob did not choose pasta still exists.\n\nAnswer: No.",
