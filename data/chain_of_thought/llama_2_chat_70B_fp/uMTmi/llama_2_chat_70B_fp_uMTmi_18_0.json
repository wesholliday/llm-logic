However, the statement \"the truck might not have been metal\" indicates that the truck's material is uncertain, and we cannot assume it was metal.\n\nSince we cannot assume the truck was metal, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic. The possibility remains that the doll was plastic, and the truck was not metal.\n\nAnswer: No.",
