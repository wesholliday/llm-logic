(J \u2192 P \u2192 L \u2192 Z)\n* Lucy might not have gone to the zoo. (\u00acL \u2192 Z)\n\nFrom the first premise, we can infer that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. However, the second premise states that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo, which means that the first premise is not necessarily true. In other words, we cannot conclusively say that Joe went to the park based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park. The possibility remains that Joe did go to the park, and Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: No.",
