In other words, the statement only establishes a one-way inference from the shirt's material to the pants' material, but does not provide any information about the possibility of the pants being denim if the shirt was not cotton.\n\nThe second statement \"Also, the pants might not have been denim\" further clarifies that the pants' material is not necessarily determined by the shirt's material, and that the pants could have been made of any material, including denim or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer that the shirt was not cotton. The statements only establish a one-way inference from the shirt's material to the pants' material, but do not provide enough information to make any conclusions about the shirt's material based on the pants' material.\n\nAnswer: No.",
