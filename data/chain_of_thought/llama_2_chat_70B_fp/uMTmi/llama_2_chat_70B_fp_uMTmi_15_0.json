This means that if Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement. If Erin might not have taken a train, then it's possible that she did not take a train. If Erin did not take a train, then according to the first statement, Sam did not take a plane.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that if Erin might not have taken a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
