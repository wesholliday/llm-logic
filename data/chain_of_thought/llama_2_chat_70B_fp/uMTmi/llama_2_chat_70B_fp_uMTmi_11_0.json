In other words, if the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake cannot be chocolate.\n\nThe statement \"The muffins might not have been blueberry\" implies that the muffins' flavor is uncertain, and we cannot assume that they were definitely blueberry.\n\nTherefore, considering both statements, we can infer that the cake might not have been chocolate, as the muffins' flavor is uncertain and the necessary condition for the cake to be chocolate (the muffins being blueberry) is not met.\n\nAnswer: No",
