            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\" implies that the color of the truck is determined by the color of the car. Specifically, if the car is red, then the truck must be blue.\n\nThe statement \"The truck might not have been blue\" implies that the color of the truck is not necessarily blue, and that there is a possibility that it was a different color.\n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can see that the color of the truck is not necessarily determined by the color of the car. In other words, even if the car was red, it's possible that the truck was not blue.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the car was not red based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
