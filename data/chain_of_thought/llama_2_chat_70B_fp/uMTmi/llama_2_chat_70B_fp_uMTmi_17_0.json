(B \u2192 KS)\n* Kate might not have eaten salad. (~KS)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first premise. If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. This means that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad. In other words, ~B \u2192 ~KS.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise. Kate might not have eaten salad. This means that it's possible that Kate did not eat salad, but it's also possible that she did eat salad. In other words, ~KS is true, but we can't infer anything about KS.\n\nNow, let's combine the two premises. We know that ~B \u2192 ~KS and ~KS is true. Using modus ponens, we can infer that ~B is true, which means that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
