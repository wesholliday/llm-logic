This means that if Sue was not at the wedding (not S), then Mary cannot have been at the wedding (not M).\n\nHowever, we also know that Sue might not have been at the wedding (not S). This means that even if Sue was not at the wedding, it does not necessarily mean that Mary was not at the wedding. In other words, the absence of Sue at the wedding does not imply the absence of Mary at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
