This means that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must also be awake.\n\nThe statement \"The mummy might not have been awake\" implies that the mummy's awakeness is uncertain. This means that we cannot assume that the mummy was awake, but we also cannot assume that the mummy was not awake.\n\nSince we cannot assume that the mummy was awake, we cannot infer that the vampire was not awake. The vampire's awakeness is still uncertain, and we need more information to make any conclusions about it.\n\nAnswer: No",
