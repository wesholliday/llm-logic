However, the second statement tells us that Amy might not have played tennis, which means that the first statement is not necessarily true. In other words, even if Jeff played basketball, it's possible that Amy did not play tennis.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Jeff did not play basketball based on the given information. The possibility that Amy did not play tennis means that we cannot conclusively determine whether Jeff played basketball or not.\n\nAnswer: No.",
