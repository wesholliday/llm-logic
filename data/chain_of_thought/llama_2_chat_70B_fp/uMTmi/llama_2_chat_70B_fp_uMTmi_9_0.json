            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nLet's break down the given information:\n\n* Premise 1: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n* Premise 2: Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\n\nFrom Premise 1, we can infer that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark definitely bought the blue shirt.\n\nFrom Premise 2, we know that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, which means that it's possible that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's consider two possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Lisa bought the red shirt.\nIn this scenario, Premise 1 tells us that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. However, since Mark might not have bought the blue shirt (Premise 2), we can't conclusively say that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nScenario 2: Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\nIn this scenario, Premise 1 does not apply, as Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Therefore, we can't infer anything about Mark's purchase. However, since Premise 2 states that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, we still can't conclusively say that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nGiven the above analysis, we can see that we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt based on the given information. Therefore, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: No.",
