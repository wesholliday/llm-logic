However, the second statement introduces a possibility that the unicorn was not in the forest. This means that the unicorn's presence in the forest is uncertain.\n\nSince the unicorn's presence in the forest is uncertain, we cannot infer with certainty that the griffin was not in the forest. The griffin's presence in the forest is still a possibility, even if the unicorn might not have been there.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: No.",
