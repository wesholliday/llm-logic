The book might not be a mystery novel.\n\nFrom 1, we can infer that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. This means that if the book is not a mystery novel, then it was not written by James.\n\nFrom 2, we know that the book might not be a mystery novel. This means that it's possible that the book is not a mystery novel, and therefore, it was not written by James.\n\nPutting 1 and 2 together, we can infer that if the book might not be a mystery novel, then it was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
