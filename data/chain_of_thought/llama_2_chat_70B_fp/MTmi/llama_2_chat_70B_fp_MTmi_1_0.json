            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe first premise \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" is a conditional statement. It implies that Sue's presence at the wedding is a necessary condition for Mary's presence at the wedding.\n\nThe second premise \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\" is a possibility statement, indicating that Sue's absence at the wedding is a possible scenario.\n\nTo infer \"Mary was not at the wedding\" from these two premises, we need to consider the following cases:\n\n1. If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary must not have been at the wedding (this follows logically from the first premise).\n2. If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary might still not have been at the wedding (this is consistent with the second premise).\n\nIn either case, the possibility of Mary not being at the wedding is not ruled out. Therefore, we can infer \"Mary was not at the wedding\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
