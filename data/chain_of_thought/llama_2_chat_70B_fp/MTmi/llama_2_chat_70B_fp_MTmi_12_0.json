Lucy might not have gone to the zoo.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo. This means that it's possible that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nIf Lucy did not go to the zoo, then the conclusion that Joe did not go to the park can be drawn. This is because, according to premise 1, if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo, but since Lucy did not go to the zoo, it's possible that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
