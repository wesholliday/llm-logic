            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe first premise \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" is a conditional statement. It implies that the banana's color is determined by the apple's color. If the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow.\n\nThe second premise \"The banana might not have been yellow\" is a possibility statement. It indicates that the banana's color might be something other than yellow.\n\nTo infer \"The apple was not red\" from these two premises, we need to consider the possible combinations of colors for the apple and banana.\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow (from the first premise).\n2. If the banana might not have been yellow, then it could have been another color (from the second premise).\n3. If the banana could have been another color, then the apple's color (red) does not determine the banana's color.\n4. Therefore, the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
