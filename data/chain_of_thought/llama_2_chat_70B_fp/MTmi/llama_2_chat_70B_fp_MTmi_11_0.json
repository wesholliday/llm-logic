The muffins might not have been blueberry.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. However, premise 2 states that the muffins might not have been blueberry, which means that the conclusion from premise 1 is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the cake was not chocolate based on the given premises. The possibility that the muffins might not have been blueberry does not necessarily mean that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: No.",
