Alex finished the race:\n\t* If Alex finished the race, then according to the first statement, Chris must have finished the race.\n\t* But if Chris might not have finished the race, then it's possible that Alex finished the race but Chris did not.\n2. Alex did not finish the race:\n\t* If Alex did not finish the race, then the first statement does not apply.\n\t* Since Chris might not have finished the race, it's possible that both Alex and Chris did not finish the race.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can see that the information provided does not allow us to infer that Alex did not finish the race. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
