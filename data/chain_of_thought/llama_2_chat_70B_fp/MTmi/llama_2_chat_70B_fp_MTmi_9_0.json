            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nLet's break down the given information:\n\n* \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" - This is a conditional statement, meaning that the truth of the second part (Mark buying the blue shirt) is dependent on the truth of the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt). In other words, if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark would not have bought the blue shirt.\n* \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\" - This statement implies that the possibility exists that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we infer \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" from the given information?\n\nIf we assume that Lisa did buy the red shirt, then according to the first statement, Mark must have bought the blue shirt. However, the second statement suggests that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, which means that the assumption that Lisa bought the red shirt leads to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
