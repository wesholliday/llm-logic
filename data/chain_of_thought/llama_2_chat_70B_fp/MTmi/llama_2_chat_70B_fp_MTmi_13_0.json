The truck might not have been blue.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. However, premise 2 states that the truck might not have been blue, which means that the truck's color is uncertain.\n\nIf the truck's color is uncertain, then we cannot conclusively determine the color of the car based on the given premises. In other words, we cannot infer that the car was not red simply because the truck might not have been blue.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: No",
