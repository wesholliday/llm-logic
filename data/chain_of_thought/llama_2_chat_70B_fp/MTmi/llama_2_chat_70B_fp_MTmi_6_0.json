Bob might not have chosen pasta.\n\nFrom 1, we can infer that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob's choice is determined, and he must have chosen pasta.\n\nFrom 2, we know that Bob might not have chosen pasta. This means that there is a possibility that Bob did not choose pasta, and his choice is not determined.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that Sue did not choose pizza. If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob's choice is not determined, and he might have chosen either pasta or pizza. This means that the information \"Bob might not have chosen pasta\" is still consistent with the possibility that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"Sue did not choose pizza\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
