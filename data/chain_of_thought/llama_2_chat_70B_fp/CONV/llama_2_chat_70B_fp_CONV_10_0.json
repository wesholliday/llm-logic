To infer the converse of this statement, we need to switch the antecedent and consequent and negate the consequent.\n\nThe converse of the statement would be \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer the converse from the original statement, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Negate the consequent of the original statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" becomes \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was not outside.\"\n2. Switch the antecedent and consequent: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was not outside\" becomes \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was inside.\"\n\nThis resulting statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the converse must also be true. Therefore, we can infer the converse of the statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
