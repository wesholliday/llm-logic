To infer the converse of this statement, we need to switch the premise and conclusion and see if the argument still holds.\n\nThe converse of the statement would be \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate\".\n\nTo determine if we can infer this converse, we need to ask ourselves if the premise \"the muffins were blueberry\" logically leads to the conclusion \"the cake was chocolate\".\n\nIf we assume that the premise is true, then we know that the muffins were blueberry. However, this does not necessarily mean that the cake was chocolate. There is no logical connection between the color of the muffins and the flavor of the cake. The flavor of the cake could have been anything - vanilla, strawberry, or even blueberry.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the converse of the given statement, and the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: No.",
