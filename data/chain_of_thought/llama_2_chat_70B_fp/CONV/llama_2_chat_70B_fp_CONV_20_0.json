In this case, A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow\".\n\nWhen we negate a conditional statement, we get the contrapositive, which has the form \"If not B, then not A\". In this case, not B is \"the banana was not yellow\", and not A is \"the apple was not red\".\n\nSo, the contrapositive of the given statement is \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\".\n\nNow, we want to know if we can infer \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red\" from the given statement. To do this, we can use the following rule of inference:\n\nModus Ponens:\n\n* If A \u2192 B is true, and B is true, then A is true.\n\nIn this case, A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow\". If we know that B is true (the banana was yellow), and we want to infer A (the apple was red), we can use Modus Ponens.\n\nSo, we can infer \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
