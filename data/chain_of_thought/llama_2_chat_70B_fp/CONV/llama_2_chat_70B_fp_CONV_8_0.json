In other words, we need to see if the relationship between the vampire's awakeness and the mummy's awakeness is symmetrical.\n\nHowever, the given statement does not provide enough information to establish this symmetry. We know that the vampire's awakeness implies the mummy's awakeness, but we do not know if the reverse is also true. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
