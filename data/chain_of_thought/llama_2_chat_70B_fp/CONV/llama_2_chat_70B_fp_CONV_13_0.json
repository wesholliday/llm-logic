            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement. It implies that the color of the car (red) is sufficient to conclude that the color of the truck is blue.\n\nTo infer \"If the truck was blue, then the car was red\" from the given statement, we need to apply the contrapositive rule. The contrapositive of a statement is obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion, and then negating the conclusion.\n\nIn this case, the hypothesis is \"the truck was blue\" and the conclusion is \"the car was red\". To apply the contrapositive rule, we switch the hypothesis and conclusion, getting \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\". This is the same as the original statement, so we can indeed infer the contrapositive statement \"If the truck was blue, then the car was red\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
