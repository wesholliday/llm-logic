It implies that the choice of pizza by Sue is sufficient to conclude that Bob chose pasta. In other words, whenever Sue chooses pizza, Bob will always choose pasta.\n\nNow, let's consider the inverse of this statement: \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza.\" This statement implies that the choice of pasta by Bob is sufficient to conclude that Sue chose pizza. However, this statement is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n\nFor example, it's possible that Sue chose pizza even though Bob didn't choose pasta. In this case, the inverse statement would be false. Therefore, we cannot infer the inverse statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
