In order to infer the converse statement \"If Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta\", we need to check if the relationship between the two statements is symmetric.\n\nIn other words, we need to check if the statement \"If Kate ate salad\" implies \"Ben ate pasta\". To do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Assume that Kate ate salad.\n2. Using the given statement, deduce that Ben ate pasta (since Kate ate salad).\n3. Therefore, if Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta.\n\nSince we have successfully deduced the converse statement, we can infer that the relationship between the two statements is symmetric, and we can conclude that \"If Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta\" is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
