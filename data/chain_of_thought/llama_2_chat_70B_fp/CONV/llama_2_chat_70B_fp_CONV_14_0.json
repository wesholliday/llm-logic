In other words, we need to see if the relationship between the wolf's presence in the den and the bear's presence in the case is symmetrical.\n\nHowever, the given statement does not provide enough information to establish this symmetry. We cannot assume that the wolf's presence in the den is sufficient to guarantee the bear's presence in the case without additional information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
