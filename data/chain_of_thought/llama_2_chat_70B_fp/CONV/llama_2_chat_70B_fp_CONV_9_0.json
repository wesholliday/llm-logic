The converse of the statement would be \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\"\n\nWe can see that the converse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The original statement does not guarantee that Mark will buy the blue shirt if Lisa does not buy the red shirt. In fact, it only tells us that if Lisa does buy the red shirt, then Mark will definitely buy the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the converse of the statement, \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
