            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement. It implies that the shirt being cotton is sufficient to conclude that the pants are denim. In other words, if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim.\n\nTo infer \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton,\" we need to flip the conditional statement. We can do this by switching the positions of the two parts of the statement. The new statement would be \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton.\"\n\nHowever, this new statement is not necessarily true. Just because the pants are denim, it doesn't mean that the shirt must be cotton. There is no logical connection between the two statements. The shirt could still be made of any other material, such as polyester or silk.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
