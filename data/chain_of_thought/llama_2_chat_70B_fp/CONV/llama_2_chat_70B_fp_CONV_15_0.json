The converse of \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" would be \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane.\"\n\nHowever, we cannot infer the converse of the statement directly from the given statement. The given statement only tells us that there is a relationship between Sam taking a plane and Erin taking a train, but it does not provide enough information to establish a causal relationship between the two events.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane\" from the given statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
