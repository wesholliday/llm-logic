            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, we need to check whether the conclusion is necessarily true if the premises are true.\n\nThe first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This is a conditional statement, which means that the truth of the second part (the mummy was awake) is dependent on the truth of the first part (the vampire was awake). In other words, if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy's state of being awake is not determined.\n\nThe second premise states that the vampire was awake. This is a simple statement that asserts the vampire's state of being awake.\n\nThe conclusion states that the mummy was awake. This is a simple statement that asserts the mummy's state of being awake.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the argument:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (premise 1).\n2. The vampire was awake (premise 2).\n3. Therefore, the mummy was awake (conclusion).\n\nWe can see that the conclusion logically follows from the premises. If the vampire was awake, then according to premise 1, the mummy must also be awake. Since premise 2 states that the vampire was awake, we can conclude that the mummy was awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
