In other words, we need to check whether the conclusion is necessarily true if the premises are true.\n\nThe first premise states that if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside. This premise establishes a conditional relationship between the dog's location and the cat's location. The second premise states that the dog was inside.\n\nIf we assume that the first premise is true, then we can deduce that the cat was outside, because the dog was inside. In other words, the truth of the first premise implies the truth of the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, because the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
