            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the first premise stating a conditional relationship between Lisa's action (buying the red shirt) and Mark's action (buying the blue shirt). The second premise states that Lisa did indeed buy the red shirt. The conclusion drawn from these premises is that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nTo determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to consider whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, is it necessarily true that the conclusion is also true?\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt (premise 1).\n2. Lisa bought the red shirt (premise 2).\n\nIf both premises are true, then we can conclude that Mark bought the blue shirt. This is because the first premise establishes a conditional relationship between Lisa's action and Mark's action, and the second premise confirms that Lisa did indeed buy the red shirt. Therefore, it logically follows that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes. The argument is logically valid.",
