            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the first premise stating a conditional relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball. The second premise asserts that Tom did indeed watch football. The conclusion then logically follows from the first premise and second premise, inferring that Jen watched basketball.\n\nTo determine the validity of this argument, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n2. Negate the conclusion: \"Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n3. Assume the negation of the first premise: \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n4. Show that the second premise and the negation of the first premise lead to a logical contradiction.\n\nIf we assume that Tom did not watch football, then the first premise becomes false. However, the second premise asserts that Tom did watch football, which means that the negation of the first premise leads to a logical contradiction. This implies that the original premises cannot both be true, and therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
