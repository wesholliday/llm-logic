            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the first premise stating a conditional relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana. The second premise asserts that the apple was red, which means that the conditional statement in the first premise is true. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows that the banana was yellow.\n\nThe form of the argument is:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n2. The apple was red.\n3. Therefore, the banana was yellow.\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Modus ponens involves drawing a conclusion from two premises, where the first premise is a conditional statement and the second premise is an assertion that the condition in the first premise is true. In this case, the argument follows the form of modus ponens, and the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
