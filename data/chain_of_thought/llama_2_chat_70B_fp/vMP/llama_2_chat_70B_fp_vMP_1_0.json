            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the first premise stating a conditional relationship between Mary's presence at the wedding and Sue's presence at the wedding. The second premise asserts that Mary was indeed at the wedding. The conclusion logically follows from the premises, as if the first premise is true and the second premise is true, then it must be the case that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nThe form of the argument is:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n2. Mary was at the wedding.\n3. Therefore, Sue was at the wedding.\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Modus ponens involves drawing a conclusion from two premises, where the first premise is a conditional statement and the second premise is an assertion of the antecedent (in this case, Mary's presence at the wedding). The conclusion logically follows from the premises, as the truth of the first premise and the second premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
