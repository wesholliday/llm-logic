            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, we need to check whether the conclusion is necessarily true if the premises are true.\n\nThe first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. This is a conditional statement, which means that the truth of the second part (the unicorn was in the forest) is dependent on the truth of the first part (the griffin was in the forest). In other words, if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn does not have to be in the forest.\n\nThe second premise states that the griffin was in the forest. This is a simple statement of fact, which means that the griffin's presence in the forest is assumed to be true.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the conclusion. The conclusion states that the unicorn was in the forest. Based on the first premise, we know that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. Since the second premise states that the griffin was in the forest, we can conclude that the unicorn was also in the forest.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
