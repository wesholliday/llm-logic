            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, we need to check if the conclusion is necessarily true if the premises are true.\n\nThe first premise states that if the book was written by James, then it's a mystery novel. This is a conditional statement, and it's saying that if the book was written by James, then it has a certain property (being a mystery novel).\n\nThe second premise states that the book was written by James. This is a declarative statement, and it's saying that the book was indeed written by James.\n\nThe conclusion is that the book is a mystery novel. This is a declarative statement, and it's saying that the book has the property of being a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the argument:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then it's a mystery novel (premise 1).\n2. The book was written by James (premise 2).\n3. Therefore, the book is a mystery novel (conclusion).\n\nWe can see that the conclusion logically follows from the premises. If the book was written by James, then it's a mystery novel (premise 1), and the book was indeed written by James (premise 2), so it's necessarily true that the book is a mystery novel (conclusion).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
