The phrase \"must have\" indicates a logical necessity, meaning that it is not possible for Alex to have not finished the race. However, the statement negates this possibility, leaving us with the idea that it is possible for Alex not to have finished the race.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Alex might not have finished the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
