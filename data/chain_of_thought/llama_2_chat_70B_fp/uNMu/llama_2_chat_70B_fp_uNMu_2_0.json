In other words, there is a possibility that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nSince we are told that the griffin is not necessarily in the forest, we can infer that it might not have been in the forest. This is because the absence of necessity implies the possibility of non-existence. In this case, the possibility of the griffin not being in the forest is what we are interested in.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we can infer that the griffin might not have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
