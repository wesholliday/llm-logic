In other words, the pen's absence from the bag is possible.\n\nHowever, the possibility of the pen's absence from the bag does not necessarily mean that the pen might not be in the bag. The pen could still be in the bag, even if it's not a necessary or obligatory presence.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the pen might not be in the bag based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
