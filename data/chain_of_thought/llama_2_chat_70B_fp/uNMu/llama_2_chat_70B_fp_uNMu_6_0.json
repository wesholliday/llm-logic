In other words, it's possible that Sue did not choose pizza. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that Sue did not choose pizza. It only means that we can't conclude with certainty that Sue chose pizza.\n\nTherefore, based on this statement alone, we can infer that it's possible that Sue might not have chosen pizza, but we can't rule out the possibility that she did choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: No.",
