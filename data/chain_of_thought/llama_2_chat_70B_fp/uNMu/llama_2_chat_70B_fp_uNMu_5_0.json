The word \"must\" implies a necessity or obligation, so if it's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball, then it's possible that he didn't play basketball.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer with certainty that Jeff might not have played basketball based on this statement alone. It's possible that Jeff played basketball, but it's also possible that he didn't. We need more information to make a definitive conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No.",
