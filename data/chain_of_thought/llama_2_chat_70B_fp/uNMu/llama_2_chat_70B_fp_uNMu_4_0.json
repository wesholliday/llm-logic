In other words, there is a chance that the alien might not have visited Mars.\n\nThe phrase \"must have\" implies a high degree of certainty or necessity. If the statement had said \"The alien must have visited Mars,\" it would suggest that there is no possibility that the alien did not visit Mars. However, since the statement says \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars,\" it implies that there is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we can infer that the alien might not have visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
