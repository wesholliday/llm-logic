In other words, it's possible that Mary did not attend the wedding.\n\nHowever, this statement does not directly imply that Mary might not have been at the wedding. It only means that we cannot assume with certainty that Mary was at the wedding. There could be other factors or information that suggest Mary did attend the wedding, even if it's not a requirement.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement alone, we cannot infer that Mary might not have been at the wedding. We need additional information to make such an inference.\n\nAnswer: No.",
