In other words, the vampire's awakeness is not a requirement for the scenario to take place.\n\nSince the vampire's awakeness is not a necessary condition, it means that the vampire might have been awake or might not have been awake. The statement does not provide enough information to conclude that the vampire was definitely awake or definitely not awake. Therefore, we can infer that the vampire might not have been awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
