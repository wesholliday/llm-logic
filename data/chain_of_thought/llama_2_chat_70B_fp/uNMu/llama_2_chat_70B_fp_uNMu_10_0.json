This does not necessarily mean that the dog might not have been inside, as there could be various reasons why the dog was not found inside, such as it being in a different location or having left the premises.\n\nHowever, the statement does open up the possibility that the dog might not have been inside, as there is no definitive proof of its presence. Therefore, we can infer that the dog might not have been inside, but we cannot say for certain without additional information.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
