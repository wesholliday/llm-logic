In other words, the toy's presence in the toy box is not a requirement or a certainty. This means that the toy could potentially be located elsewhere, and its absence from the toy box is not necessarily evidence that it has been stolen.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we can infer that the toy might not be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
