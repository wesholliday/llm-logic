In other words, the watch could be charging even if it's not on the dresser.\n\nHowever, this statement does not necessarily mean that the watch might not be charging on the dresser. It's possible that the watch is charging on the dresser, but it's not a requirement for it to be charging.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we cannot infer that the watch might not be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: No.",
