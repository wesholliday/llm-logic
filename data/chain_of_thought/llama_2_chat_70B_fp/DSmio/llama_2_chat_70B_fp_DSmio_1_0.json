Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\n\nFrom 1, we know that Fido's presence in the garden is uncertain.\nFrom 2, we know that Fido must be either inside or in the garden.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Fido is inside.\nIn this scenario, Fido is not in the garden, which aligns with the first piece of information. Additionally, since Fido is inside, it satisfies the second piece of information that either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\n\nScenario 2: Fido is not inside.\nIn this scenario, Fido must be in the garden, according to the second piece of information. However, this contradicts the first piece of information that Fido might not be in the garden.\n\nTherefore, the only possible scenario that satisfies both pieces of information is Scenario 1, where Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
