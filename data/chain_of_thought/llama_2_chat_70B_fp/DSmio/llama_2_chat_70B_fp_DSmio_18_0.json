The options are:\n\t* The notebook is in the drawer.\n\t* The notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nSince the first option is \"The notebook is in the drawer,\" and we know that the notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
