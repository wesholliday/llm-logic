Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the jacket might not be in the closet, but we don't know its actual location.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the jacket must be in one of two locations: draped over the chair or hanging in the closet. Since we've already established that the jacket might not be in the closet (statement 1), the only remaining option is that it's draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
