            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given premises are:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n2. The banana was yellow.\n\nWe need to determine if we can logically conclude that the apple was red.\n\nLet's break down the first premise:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nThis premise implies that the apple's redness is sufficient to conclude that the banana is yellow. In other words, if the apple was red, then the banana must be yellow.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise:\n\n2. The banana was yellow.\n\nThis premise states that the banana had the property of being yellow.\n\nNow, let's put the two premises together:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n2. The banana was yellow.\n\nWe can conclude that if the apple was red, then the banana must be yellow, and since the banana is indeed yellow, it follows that the apple must have been red.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
