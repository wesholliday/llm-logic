To determine if we can logically conclude \"Sue chose pizza\", we need to evaluate the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe conditional statement implies that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob's choice of pasta is a consequence of Sue's choice. In other words, if Sue chose pizza, then Bob's choice of pasta is guaranteed.\n\nGiven that Bob chose pasta, we can infer that the condition in the conditional statement (\"Sue chose pizza\") must have been met, since the consequence (\"Bob chose pasta\") has occurred.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can logically conclude that Sue chose pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
