            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on a conditional statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\". The conditional statement implies that the doll being plastic is sufficient to conclude that the truck is metal.\n\nWe are also given the premise \"The truck was metal\". This premise provides additional information that the truck is indeed metal.\n\nUsing modus ponens, a logical rule of inference, we can conclude that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In this case, the conclusion is \"The doll was plastic\".\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can logically conclude that the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
