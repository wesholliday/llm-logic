            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on a conditional statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" which means that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must be denim. The premise \"The pants were denim\" is given.\n\nTo conclude \"The shirt was cotton\" from the given premises, we need to use Modus Ponens, a rule of inference that allows us to deduce the antecedent (first part) of a conditional statement when the consequent (second part) is known to be true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" and the consequent \"The pants were denim\" is given. Therefore, we can use Modus Ponens to deduce the antecedent \"The shirt was cotton\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
