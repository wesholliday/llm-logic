            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information can be represented as follows:\n\n* If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball (premise 1)\n* Jen watched basketball (premise 2)\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. In other words, the statement \"Tom watched football\" implies the statement \"Jen watched basketball\".\n\nNow, let's consider the given information, premise 2: Jen watched basketball. This statement does not directly imply anything about Tom watching football. However, we can use modus ponens, a logical rule of inference, to combine premise 1 and premise 2 to draw a conclusion.\n\nModus ponens states that if a statement of the form \"If A, then B\" is true, and B is true, then we can conclude that A is true. In this case, A is \"Tom watched football\" and B is \"Jen watched basketball\".\n\nTherefore, using modus ponens, we can conclude that Tom watched football.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
