            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information is in the form of a conditional statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" and a premise \"The book is a mystery novel\". To determine if we can logically conclude \"The book was written by James\", we need to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe argument is valid if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is \"The book was written by James\" and the premises are \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" and \"The book is a mystery novel\".\n\nWe can use modus ponens, a rule of inference, to deduce the conclusion from the premises. Modus ponens states that if a conditional statement is true and the antecedent is true, then the consequent must be true. In this case, the conditional statement is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\", and the antecedent is \"The book is a mystery novel\". Therefore, we can deduce the consequent \"The book was written by James\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
