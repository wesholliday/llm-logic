The wolf was in the den.\n\nWe need to determine if we can logically conclude that the bear was in the cave.\n\nLet's break down the first premise:\n\n1. If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nThis premise implies that the bear's presence in the cave is sufficient to guarantee the wolf's presence in the den. In other words, if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise:\n\n2. The wolf was in the den.\n\nThis premise states that the wolf was indeed in the den.\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can conclude that the bear was in the cave:\n\n1. If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n2. The wolf was in the den.\n3. Therefore, the bear was in the cave.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
