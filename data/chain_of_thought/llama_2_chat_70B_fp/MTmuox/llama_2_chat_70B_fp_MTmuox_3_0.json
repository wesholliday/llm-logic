If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that the splat did not have to quank.\n\nFrom premise 2, we can infer that if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the splat was morphed. If the splat was morphed, then by premise 2, it must have quanked. However, this contradicts premise 1, which states that it's not the case that the splat must have quanked.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
