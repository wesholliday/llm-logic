However, this scenario is incompatible with the first premise, which states that it's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled.\n\nScenario 2: The flugel was not blimmed.\nIn this scenario, the flugel not being zargled is consistent with both premises. The first premise allows for the possibility that the flugel was not zargled, and the second premise does not apply since the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
