If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that the flob may or may not have movated.\n\nFrom premise 2, we can infer that if the flob was skizzled, then it must have movated.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the flob was skizzled. If the flob was skizzled, then according to premise 2, it must have movated. However, this contradicts premise 1, which states that it's not the case that the flob must have movated.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the flob was not skizzled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
