In other words, it's possible that the clug was not snugged.\n2. \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged\" means that if the clug was fleeked, then it must have been snugged. This implies that if the clug was not snugged, then it was not fleeked.\n\nNow, let's use these two statements to infer whether the clug was fleeked or not.\n\nIf the clug was not snugged, then by statement 2, it was not fleeked. Therefore, we can infer that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
