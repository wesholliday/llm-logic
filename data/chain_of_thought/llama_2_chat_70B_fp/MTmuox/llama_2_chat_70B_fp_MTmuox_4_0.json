In other words, we can't conclude that the fribble must have crinked.\n* \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked\" means that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked. This is a conditional statement, where the hypothesis is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and the conclusion is \"the fribble must have crinked\".\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer 'The fribble was not snurgled'?\"\n\nIf we assume that the fribble was snurgled, then by the second statement, the fribble must have crinked. However, the first statement tells us that it's not the case that the fribble must have crinked. This means that the fribble's crinkedness is not necessarily true, even if it was snurgled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the fribble was not snurgled, because if it was snurgled, then it must have crinked, but we know that it's not necessarily true that the fribble must have crinked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
