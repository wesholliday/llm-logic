If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that the shank was not nugged. If the shank was nugged, then it would be the case that the shank must have been nugged, which contradicts premise 1.\n\nFrom premise 2, we can infer that if the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged. This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"the shank was plooked\" and the consequent is \"the shank must have been nugged\".\n\nNow, let's consider the argument as a whole. We know that the shank was not nugged (from premise 1). If the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged (from premise 2). Therefore, we can infer that the shank was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
