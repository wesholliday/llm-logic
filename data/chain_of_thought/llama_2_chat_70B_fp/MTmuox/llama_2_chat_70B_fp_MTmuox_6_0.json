In other words, it's possible that the grommet did not plop the frink.\n* \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink\" means that if the grommet was sploffed, then it's necessary that the grommet plopped the frink. In other words, if the grommet was sploffed, then it's not possible that the grommet did not plop the frink.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the grommet was not sploffed. If the grommet was not sploffed, then by the second premise, it's not necessary that the grommet plopped the frink. This means that it's possible that the grommet did not plop the frink, even if it was not sploffed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the grommet was not sploffed, because if it was not sploffed, then it's possible that it did not plop the frink, and we know that it's not necessary that the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
