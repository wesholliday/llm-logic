If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that the sneg did not sprot the frink.\n\nFrom premise 2, we can infer that if the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the sneg was crampled. If the sneg was crampled, then according to premise 2, the sneg must have sproted the frink. However, this contradicts premise 1, which states that it's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
