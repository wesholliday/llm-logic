In this case, the second premise \"Either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated\" is satisfied, and the conclusion \"The flob is skizzled\" follows logically.\n\nScenario 2: The flob is not skizzled. In this case, the first premise \"It's not the case that the flob must be movated\" implies that the flob is not movated. However, this would violate the second premise \"Either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated\", since the flob is not skizzled and it's not movated. Therefore, this scenario is impossible.\n\nSince Scenario 1 is the only possible scenario, we can conclude that the flob is indeed skizzled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
