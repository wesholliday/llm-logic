In other words, there is a possibility that the wug is not bimmed.\n2. \"Either the wug is flooped or it must be bimmed\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning that one of the two options must be true. Either the wug is flooped or it must be bimmed.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The wug is flooped. In this case, the first statement \"It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed\" is true, because the wug is not necessarily bimmed. The second statement \"Either the wug is flooped or it must be bimmed\" is also true, because the wug is flooped.\n\nScenario 2: The wug is not flooped. In this case, the first statement \"It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed\" is still true, because the wug is not necessarily bimmed. However, the second statement \"Either the wug is flooped or it must be bimmed\" is false, because the wug is not flooped.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that the wug is flooped.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
