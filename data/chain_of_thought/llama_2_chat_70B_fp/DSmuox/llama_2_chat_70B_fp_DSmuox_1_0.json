In this case, the first statement is false, but the second statement is true because the flugel is blimmed, and it's not necessary to zargle it.\nScenario 2: The flugel is not blimmed. In this case, the first statement is true, but the second statement is false because the flugel is not blimmed, and it must be zargled.\n\nSince both statements are true in Scenario 1, and Scenario 2 leads to a contradiction, we can conclude that the flugel is indeed blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
