The second premise (\"Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened\") is also true, because the dreb is vroombed.\n\nScenario 2: The dreb is not vroombed.\nIn this scenario, the first premise (\"It's not the case that the dreb must be spened\") is still true, because the dreb is not necessarily spened. However, the second premise (\"Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened\") is false, because the dreb is not vroombed.\n\nSince Scenario 1 is the only scenario that makes both premises true, we can conclude that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
