In other words, there is a possibility that the splat is not quanked.\n2. \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked\" means that there are only two possibilities for the splat: it is either morphed or it must be quanked.\n\nNow, let's consider the combination of these two statements:\n\nIf the splat is not necessarily quanked (statement 1), then it could be morphed (statement 2). Therefore, we can infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
