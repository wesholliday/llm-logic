In other words, there is a possibility that the sprocket is not daggled.\n2. \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled\" is a disjunction that states that either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The sprocket is cranked.\nIn this scenario, the sprocket is not daggled, which aligns with the first premise. Additionally, since the sprocket is cranked, it satisfies the second premise.\n\nScenario 2: The sprocket is not cranked.\nIn this scenario, the sprocket must be daggled, which contradicts the first premise. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\nSince Scenario 1 is the only possible scenario, we can conclude that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
