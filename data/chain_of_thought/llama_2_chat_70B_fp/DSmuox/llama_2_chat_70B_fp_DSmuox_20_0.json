In other words, there is a possibility that the fleeg is not surned.\n2. \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned\" is a disjunctive statement, meaning that one of the two conditions must be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The fleeg is bluttered. In this case, the first statement \"It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned\" is true, because the fleeg is not necessarily surned. The second statement \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned\" is also true, because the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nScenario 2: The fleeg is not bluttered. In this case, the first statement \"It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned\" is still true, because the fleeg is not necessarily surned. However, the second statement \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned\" is false, because the fleeg is not bluttered.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
