In this case, the first premise \"It's not the case that the clug must be snugged\" is true, because the clug is not snugged. The second premise \"Either the clug is fleeked or it must be snugged\" is also true, because the clug is fleeked.\n\nScenario 2: The clug is not fleeked. In this case, the first premise \"It's not the case that the clug must be snugged\" is false, because the clug must be snugged (since it's not fleeked). The second premise \"Either the clug is fleeked or it must be snugged\" is also false, because the clug is not fleeked.\n\nSince Scenario 1 is the only scenario that makes both premises true, we can conclude that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
