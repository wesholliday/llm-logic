            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the first premise stating a conditional relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo. The second premise introduces a possibility that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo. The conclusion then states that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nTo determine the validity of this argument, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n2. Negate the conclusion: \"Joe did not go to the park\" becomes \"Joe went to the park.\"\n3. Determine the contrapositive of the conditional statement: \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\"\n4. Check if the argument is logically valid by comparing the negated conclusion and the contrapositive:\n\nNegated conclusion: Joe went to the park.\nContrapositive: Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nSince the negated conclusion and the contrapositive are the same, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
