            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the first premise stating a conditional relationship between the shirt and pants, and the second premise providing a possibility about the pants. The conclusion is a negation of the first premise.\n\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the conditional relationship in the first premise: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\"\n2. Negate the conclusion: \"The shirt was not cotton\"\n3. Determine the contrapositive of the first premise: \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\"\n4. Check if the second premise is consistent with the contrapositive: \"The pants might not have been denim\"\n\nIf the second premise is consistent with the contrapositive, then the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
