            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the first premise stating a conditional relationship between the color of the car and the truck. The second premise introduces a possibility that the truck might not have been blue. The conclusion drawn from these premises is that the car was not red.\n\nTo determine the validity of this argument, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\"\n2. Negate the conclusion: \"The car was not red\"\n3. Determine the contrapositive of the conditional statement: \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\"\n4. Check if the argument is logically valid by seeing if the negated conclusion is equivalent to the contrapositive:\n\nNegated conclusion: \"The car was not red\"\nContrapositive: \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\"\n\nSince the negated conclusion and the contrapositive are equivalent, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
