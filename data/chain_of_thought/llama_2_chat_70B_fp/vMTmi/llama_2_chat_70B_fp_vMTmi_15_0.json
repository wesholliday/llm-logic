            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the first premise stating a conditional relationship between Sam taking a plane and Erin taking a train. The second premise introduces a possibility that Erin might not have taken a train. The conclusion then states that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nTo determine the validity of this argument, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the conditional statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train\"\n2. Negate the conclusion: \"Sam did not take a plane\"\n3. Determine the contrapositive of the conditional statement: \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane\"\n4. Check if the argument is logically valid by comparing the negated conclusion and the contrapositive:\n\nNegated conclusion: \"Sam did not take a plane\"\nContrapositive: \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane\"\n\nSince the negated conclusion and the contrapositive are equivalent, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
