            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a type of modus tollens argument, which has the following form:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel\". The first premise states that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. The second premise states that the book might not be a mystery novel. The conclusion is that the book was not written by James.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, we need to see if it is impossible for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true.\n\nIf the first premise is true, then the book must be a mystery novel if it was written by James. If the second premise is true, then the book might not be a mystery novel. If both premises are true, then it is possible that the book was not written by James, because it might not be a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"the book was not written by James\" logically follows from the premises. This means that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
