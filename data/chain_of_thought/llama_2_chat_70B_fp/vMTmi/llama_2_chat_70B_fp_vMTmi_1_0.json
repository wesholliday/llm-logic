            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the first premise stating a conditional relationship between Mary's presence at the wedding and Sue's presence at the wedding. The second premise introduces a possibility that Sue might not have been at the wedding. The conclusion drawn from these premises is that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nTo determine the validity of this argument, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, we need to consider whether it is possible for the conclusion to be true if the premises are true.\n\nIf we assume that the first premise is true, then we know that if Mary was at the wedding, Sue must have been at the wedding. However, the second premise introduces a possibility that Sue might not have been at the wedding. This means that we cannot conclusively say that Sue was at the wedding, even if Mary was.\n\nTherefore, based on the premises, we cannot definitively say that Mary was not at the wedding. It is possible that both Mary and Sue were at the wedding, or that neither of them was at the wedding. In either case, the conclusion that Mary was not at the wedding does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No, the argument is not logically valid.",
