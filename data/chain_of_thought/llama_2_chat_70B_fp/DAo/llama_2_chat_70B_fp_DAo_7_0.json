If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nFrom 1, we know that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nFrom 2, we know that if Alex had finished the race, then Chris would have finished the race too.\n\nNow, let's consider two possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Alex finished the race.\nIn this scenario, we know that Chris finished the race too, since \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is true. But this scenario is impossible since we've been told that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nScenario 2: Alex did not finish the race.\nIn this scenario, we know that Chris did not finish the race either, since Alex did not finish the race and \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
