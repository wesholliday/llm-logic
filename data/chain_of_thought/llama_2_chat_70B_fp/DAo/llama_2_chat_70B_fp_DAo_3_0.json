However, since we know that the book was not written by James, the antecedent is false, and we can't conclude anything about the genre of the book.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer \"The book is not a mystery novel.\" We need more information or additional premises to make such an inference.\n\nAnswer: No.",
