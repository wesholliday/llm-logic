(not given)\n\nWe want to infer the state of the mummy. Using the second statement, we can deduce that if the vampire was awake, the mummy would also be awake. However, since the vampire is not awake, we can conclude that the mummy's state is not \"awake\".\n\nTherefore, the mummy's state is \"not awake\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
