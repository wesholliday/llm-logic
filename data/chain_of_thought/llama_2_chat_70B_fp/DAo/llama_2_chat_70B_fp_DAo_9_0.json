            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt', we need to evaluate the given information and see if it leads to a logical conclusion.\n\nThe first statement 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' means that the red shirt was not purchased by Lisa.\n\nThe second statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement. It implies that if Lisa had purchased the red shirt, Mark would have purchased the blue shirt. Since Lisa did not buy the red shirt, the condition in the second statement is not met, and we cannot conclude that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nHowever, we can infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, as the condition in the second statement that would have led to Mark buying the blue shirt did not occur.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
