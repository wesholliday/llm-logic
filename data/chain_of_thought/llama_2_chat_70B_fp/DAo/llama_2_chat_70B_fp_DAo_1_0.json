            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer 'Sue was not at the wedding' from the given statements, we need to evaluate the relationship between the statements and the information they provide.\n\nThe first statement, 'Mary was not at the wedding,' tells us that Mary did not attend the wedding. The second statement, 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,' provides a conditional relationship between Mary and Sue's attendance at the wedding. It means that if Mary had attended the wedding, Sue would have also attended the wedding.\n\nSince we know that Mary did not attend the wedding, we can infer that Sue did not attend the wedding either, based on the conditional statement. In other words, if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding either, given the conditional relationship between their attendance.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
