            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The banana was not yellow\" from the given statements, we need to evaluate the relationship between the statements and the conclusion.\n\nThe first statement \"The apple was not red\" does not provide any information about the color of the banana. It only tells us that the apple was not red, but it could still be yellow, green, or any other color.\n\nThe second statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the apple were red, then the banana would be yellow. However, since the apple is not red, we cannot conclude that the banana is yellow. In fact, we cannot conclude anything about the color of the banana based on this statement alone.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The banana was not yellow\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
