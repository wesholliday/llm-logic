If the flug must be zimmed, then it is not blummed, and if it is blummed, then it must not be zimmed.\n\nThe second premise \"It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed\" indicates that the first option, \"the flug must be zimmed,\" is not true. Therefore, by process of elimination, the second option, \"it is blummed,\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
