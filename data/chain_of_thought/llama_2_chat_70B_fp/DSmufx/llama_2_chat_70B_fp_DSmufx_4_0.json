It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked (denoted as \u00acCF)\n\nFrom EFC, we can deduce that the fribble must be either crinked or snurgled. Since \u00acCF states that the fribble must not be crinked, the only remaining option is that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw from the given premises is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
