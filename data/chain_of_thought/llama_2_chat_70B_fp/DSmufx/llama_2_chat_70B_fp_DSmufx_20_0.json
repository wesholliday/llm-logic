If the fleeg must be surned, then it is not bluttered, and if it is bluttered, then it must not be surned.\n\nThe second premise \"It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned\" indicates that the first option, \"the fleeg must be surned,\" is not true. Therefore, by process of elimination, the second option, \"the fleeg is bluttered,\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
