In other words, if a customer was greeted, it means they were not greeted warmly, and if they were greeted warmly, it means they were not simply greeted.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted, because greeting a customer warmly and simply greeting a customer are two different things.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
