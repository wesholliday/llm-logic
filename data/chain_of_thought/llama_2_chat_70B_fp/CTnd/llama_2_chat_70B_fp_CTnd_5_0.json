This is because when the room is cleaned, it means that it was not thoroughly cleaned, and when it is not cleaned, it means that it was thoroughly cleaned.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\". We can represent this statement using a truth table as follows:\n\n| Cleaned Thoroughly | Cleaned |\n| --- | --- |\n| True | False |\n| False | True |\n\nAs we can see from the truth table, this statement is logically equivalent to \"If the room was not cleaned, then it was cleaned thoroughly\". This is because when the room is cleaned thoroughly, it means that it was not cleaned, and when it is not cleaned, it means that it was cleaned thoroughly.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\" from the given statement \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
