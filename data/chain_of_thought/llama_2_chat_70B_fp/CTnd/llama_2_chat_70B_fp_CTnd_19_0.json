            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe original statement \"If directions were provided, then they were not explained clearly\" is a conditional statement with a negative conclusion. It implies that if directions were provided, then it is not the case that they were explained clearly.\n\nTo infer \"If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided\" from the original statement, we need to use a process called contraposition. Contraposition involves switching the hypothesis and conclusion of a conditional statement and negating both parts.\n\nIn this case, we can start by switching the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement:\n\n\"If directions were not explained clearly, then they were provided\"\n\nThis is the contrapositive of the original statement. Now, we need to negate both parts to get the desired conclusion:\n\n\"If directions were explained clearly, then they were not provided\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided\" from the original statement \"If directions were provided, then they were not explained clearly\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
