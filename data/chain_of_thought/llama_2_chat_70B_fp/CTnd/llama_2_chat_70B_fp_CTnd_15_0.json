This is because when the room is tidied, it means that it was not tidied thoroughly, and when it is not tidied, it means that it was tidied thoroughly.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied\" by contrapositive reasoning. The contrapositive of the given statement is \"If the room was not tidied, then it was tidied thoroughly\", which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
