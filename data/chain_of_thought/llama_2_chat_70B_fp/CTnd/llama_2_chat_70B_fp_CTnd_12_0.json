The antecedent \"Jane studied\" is false, and the consequent \"she did not study long\" is true.\n\nNow, let's consider the inverse of this statement: \"If Jane studied long, then she did not study.\" We can represent this statement using a truth table as follows:\n\n| Jane studied long | Did not study |\n| --- | --- |\n| True | True |\n| False | False |\n\nAs we can see from the truth table, the inverse statement is also a conditional statement with a negative conclusion. The antecedent \"Jane studied long\" is true, and the consequent \"she did not study\" is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If Jane studied long, then she did not study\" from the given statement \"If Jane studied, then she did not study long.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
