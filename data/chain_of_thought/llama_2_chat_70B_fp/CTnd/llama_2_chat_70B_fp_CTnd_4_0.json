            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement \"If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently\" can be represented using a truth table as follows:\n\n| Ben studied | Did not study diligently |\n| --- | --- |\n| True | True |\n| False | False |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that the statement is a contrapositive, meaning that the conclusion \"he did not study diligently\" follows logically from the premise \"Ben studied\".\n\nNow, let's consider the proposed inference \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study\". This statement is in the form of a modus tollens, which has the following form:\n\nIf A, then B\nNot B\nTherefore, not A\n\nIn this case, A is \"Ben studied diligently\" and B is \"he did not study\". We want to know if we can infer not A (i.e., \"he did not study\") from the premises \"If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently\" and \"Ben studied diligently\".\n\nTo do this, we need to negate the conclusion of the original statement, which gives us \"If Ben studied, then he did study diligently\". This is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nNow, we can use the modus tollens formula to draw the conclusion:\n\nIf Ben studied diligently, then he did study diligently\nNot he did study diligently (given)\nTherefore, not Ben studied diligently\n\nThis means that we can indeed infer \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study\" from the premises \"If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently\" and \"Ben studied diligently\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
