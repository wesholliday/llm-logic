It implies that if instructions were given, then they must not have been explained clearly, otherwise, the statement would be false.\n\nTo infer \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given\" from the original statement, we need to use a process called contraposition. Contraposition involves switching the hypothesis and conclusion of a conditional statement and negating both parts. In this case, we can rewrite the original statement as:\n\n\"If instructions were not explained clearly, then they were given.\"\n\nNow, we can use the contrapositive of this statement to get:\n\n\"If instructions were explained clearly, then they were not given.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
