We can see that the hypothesis of the new statement is the negation of the conclusion of the original statement, and the conclusion of the new statement is the negation of the hypothesis of the original statement. This is a valid inference method known as contrapositive.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If Alex exercised much (M), then he did not exercise (not E)\" from the given statement \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much (not M)\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
