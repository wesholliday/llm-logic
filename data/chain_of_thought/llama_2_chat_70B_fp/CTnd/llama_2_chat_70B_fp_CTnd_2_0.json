The antecedent \"Ann exercised\" is false, and the consequent \"she did not exercise strenuously\" is true.\n\nNow, let's consider the inverse of this statement: \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise.\" We can represent this statement using a truth table as follows:\n\n| Ann Exercised Strenuously | Did Not Exercise |\n| --- | --- |\n| True | False |\n| False | True |\n\nAs we can see from the truth table, the inverse statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The original statement asserts that if Ann exercised, then she did not exercise strenuously, whereas the inverse statement asserts that if Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise at all. These are not the same statements, and we cannot infer the inverse statement from the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: No",
