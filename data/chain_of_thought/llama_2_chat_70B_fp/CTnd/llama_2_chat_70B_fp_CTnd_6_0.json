It implies that if the clothes were washed, then they must not have been washed properly, otherwise, the statement would be false.\n\nTo infer \"If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed\" from the given statement, we need to use a process called contraposition. Contraposition involves switching the hypothesis and conclusion of a conditional statement and negating the conclusion.\n\nIn this case, we can start by switching the hypothesis and conclusion of the given statement:\n\n\"If they were not washed properly, then they were washed.\"\n\nNow, we need to negate the conclusion to get the contrapositive statement:\n\n\"If they were washed properly, then they were not washed.\"\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive statement of the given statement is:\n\n\"If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
