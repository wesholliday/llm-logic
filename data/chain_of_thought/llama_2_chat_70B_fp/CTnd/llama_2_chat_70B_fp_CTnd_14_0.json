It means that if the meal was prepared, then it was not prepared with care.\n\nTo infer \"If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared\" from the given statement, we need to use a process called contraposition. Contraposition involves switching the hypothesis and conclusion of a conditional statement and negating the conclusion.\n\nSo, if we apply contraposition to the given statement, we get:\n\n\"If the meal was not prepared carefully, then it was prepared.\"\n\nThis statement is the contrapositive of the original statement, and it means that if the meal was not prepared with care, then it was prepared.\n\nNow, we can use this contrapositive statement to infer the desired statement:\n\n\"If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared.\"\n\nThis statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, and it means that if the meal was prepared with care, then it was not prepared.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
