            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a contrapositive, meaning that it expresses a negative relationship between two events. The statement can be broken down into two parts:\n\n1. \"If the issue was addressed\" - This part of the statement implies that the issue was not ignored or dismissed, but rather, it was acknowledged and acted upon.\n2. \"then it was not addressed effectively\" - This part of the statement implies that even though the issue was acknowledged and acted upon, the solution or response was not sufficient or successful in resolving the issue.\n\nTo infer the converse of this statement, we need to switch the parts and negate them. The converse would be:\n\n1. \"If the issue was not addressed\" - This part of the statement implies that the issue was ignored or dismissed, and not acted upon.\n2. \"then it was addressed effectively\" - This part of the statement implies that since the issue was not acted upon, it was not addressed effectively.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the issue was not addressed, then it was addressed effectively, which means that the statement \"If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
