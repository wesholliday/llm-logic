Modus tollens involves negating the consequent (not eating a meal) and then reversing the antecedent (eating a large meal) to create a new statement.\n\nSo, using modus tollens, we can create a new statement:\n\nNot Meal \u279d Not Large Meal\n\nThis new statement means that if we did not eat a meal, then we did not eat a large meal.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
