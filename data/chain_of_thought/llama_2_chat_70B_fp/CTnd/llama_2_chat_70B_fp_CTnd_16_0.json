The statement can be broken down into two parts:\n\n1. \"If the job was completed\" - This part asserts that the job was finished.\n2. \"then it was not completed well\" - This part implies that the job was not done satisfactorily.\n\nTo infer the converse of this statement, we need to switch the parts and negate the second part. The converse would be:\n\n1. \"If the job was completed well\" - This part asserts that the job was done satisfactorily.\n2. \"then it was not completed\" - This part implies that the job was not finished.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the job was completed well, then it was not completed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
