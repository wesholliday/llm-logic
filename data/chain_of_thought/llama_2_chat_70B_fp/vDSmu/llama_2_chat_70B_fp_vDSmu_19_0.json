The second premise is \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\" This premise negates the second option presented in the first premise, meaning that the watch cannot be on his wrist.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can deduce the conclusion from the premises. Since the watch cannot be on his wrist, the only remaining option is that it is charging on the dresser. Therefore, the conclusion \"The watch is charging on the dresser\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
