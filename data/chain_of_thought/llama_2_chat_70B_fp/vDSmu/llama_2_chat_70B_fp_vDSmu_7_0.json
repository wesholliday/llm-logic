The second premise, \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet\", is a negation of the second option, which means that the first option, \"the umbrella is in the car\", must be true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion, \"The umbrella is in the car\", logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
