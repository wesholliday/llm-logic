Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\n2. It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\n3. Therefore, the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nThe first premise presents two exclusive options for the location of the sunglasses, either in her bag or on her head. The second premise denies the possibility that the sunglasses are perched on her head. By process of elimination, the conclusion logically follows that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
