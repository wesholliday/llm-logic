The second premise states that it's not the case that the pen must be on the desk. Therefore, if the second premise is true, then the pen must be in the speaker's bag, which is the conclusion of the argument.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk (first premise)\n2. It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk (second premise)\n3. Therefore, the pen is in my bag (conclusion)\n\nAnswer: Yes",
