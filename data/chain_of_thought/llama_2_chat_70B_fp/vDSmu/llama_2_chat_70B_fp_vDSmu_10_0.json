Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed.\n2. It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\n3. Therefore, the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nThe first premise presents two exclusive options for the location of the missing sock, suggesting that it must be in one of those two places. The second premise denies the possibility that the sock is under the bed, which means that the only remaining option is that the sock is in the laundry basket. The conclusion logically follows from the first two premises.\n\nAnswer:\n\nYes.",
