It could be somewhere else or not draped at all.\n2. \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack\" presents two exclusive options for the scarf's location: either it's in the backpack or it's draped on the coat rack.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. If the scarf is not draped on the coat rack (as stated in the first premise), then it must be in the backpack (according to the second premise).\n2. If the scarf is draped on the coat rack, then it cannot be in the backpack (since the second premise states that it's either one or the other).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the scarf is indeed stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
