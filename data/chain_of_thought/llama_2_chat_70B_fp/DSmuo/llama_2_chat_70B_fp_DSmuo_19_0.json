If the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser (since the two options are mutually exclusive).\n2. If the watch is on his wrist, then it cannot be charging on the dresser (since the watch cannot be in two places at once).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
