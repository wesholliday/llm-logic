It implies that the vampire's state of being awake is sufficient to conclude that the mummy is also awake.\n\nTo infer the converse of this statement, we need to switch the hypothesis and conclusion. The converse of the statement would be \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.\"\n\nHowever, we cannot infer the converse directly from the given statement. The given statement only tells us that the vampire's awakeness implies the mummy's awakeness, but it doesn't tell us anything about the mummy's awakeness implying the vampire's awakeness.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake\" directly from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
