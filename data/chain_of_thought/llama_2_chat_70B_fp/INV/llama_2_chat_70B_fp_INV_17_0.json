To infer the negation of the conclusion, we need to negate the hypothesis.\n\nThe negation of \"Ben ate pasta\" is \"Ben did not eat pasta\". Therefore, the negation of the conclusion \"Kate ate salad\" is \"Kate did not eat salad\".\n\nSo, we can infer \"If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
