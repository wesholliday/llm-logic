It implies that the muffins being blueberry is a consequence of the cake being chocolate.\n\nTo infer the converse of this statement, we need to switch the hypothesis and conclusion. The converse of the statement would be \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\"\n\nHowever, we cannot infer the converse directly from the given statement. The given statement only tells us that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry, but it doesn't provide any information about the relationship between the muffins and the cake when the cake is not chocolate.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\" directly from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
