In this case, we have the conditional statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel,\" and we know that the book was not written by James (i.e., the negation of A is true). Therefore, we can use modus tollens to conclude that the book is not a mystery novel (i.e., the negation of B is true).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
