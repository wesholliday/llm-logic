            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement. It implies that the shirt being cotton is sufficient to conclude that the pants are denim.\n\nTo infer the converse of this statement, we need to switch the hypothesis and conclusion. The converse of \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" would be \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton.\"\n\nHowever, the converse of a statement is not always true. In this case, the converse is not true because it's possible for the pants to be denim even if the shirt is not cotton. For example, the pants could be denim and the shirt could be polyester.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
