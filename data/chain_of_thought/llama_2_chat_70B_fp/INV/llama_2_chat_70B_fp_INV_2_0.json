            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe original statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" is a conditional statement, where the presence of the griffin in the forest implies the presence of the unicorn in the forest.\n\nTo infer the converse statement \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest,\" we need to use the concept of contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement is obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion, and then negating both parts.\n\nIn this case, the hypothesis is \"the griffin was in the forest\" and the conclusion is \"the unicorn was in the forest.\" To form the contrapositive, we switch the hypothesis and conclusion, giving us \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nNow, we need to negate both parts of the statement to get the desired converse statement. Negating the hypothesis gives us \"the unicorn was in the forest\" (since we're negating the negation), and negating the conclusion gives us \"the griffin was not in the forest.\" Therefore, the converse statement is \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
