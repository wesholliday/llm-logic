The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nA = Lisa bought the red shirt\nB = Mark bought the blue shirt\n\nSo, the contrapositive is:\n\nIf Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the contrapositive statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
