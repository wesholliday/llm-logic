The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nSo, to infer the converse of the given statement, we can start with the contrapositive:\n\n\"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\"\n\nNow, we can use modus tollens to infer the converse:\n\n\"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
