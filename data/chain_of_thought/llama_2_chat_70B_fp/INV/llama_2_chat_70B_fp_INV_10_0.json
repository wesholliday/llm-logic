That is, we can rewrite the statement as \"If the cat was inside, then the dog was outside.\"\n\nNow, we have a new conditional statement, where the presence of the cat inside implies the absence of the dog outside.\n\nUsing the same logic as before, we can infer that if the cat was not inside, then the dog was not outside.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
