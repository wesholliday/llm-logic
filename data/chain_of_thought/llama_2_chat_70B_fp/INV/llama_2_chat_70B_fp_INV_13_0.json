            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement, \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" It implies that there is a direct relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck. Specifically, if the car is red, then the truck must be blue.\n\nTo determine if we can infer the converse of this statement, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. In this case, the premise is \"the car was red,\" and the conclusion is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\nIf we negate the premise to \"the car was not red,\" we can see that the conclusion \"the truck was blue\" is still true. This is because the statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" implies that if the car is not red, then the truck is not blue.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the converse of the statement, which is \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
