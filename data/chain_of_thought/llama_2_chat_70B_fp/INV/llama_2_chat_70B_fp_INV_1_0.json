            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\" To determine if we can infer the converse of this statement, we need to examine the relationship between A and B.\n\nIn this case, A is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and B is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" The statement implies that Mary's presence at the wedding guarantees Sue's presence at the wedding. In other words, if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding too.\n\nTo infer the converse of this statement, we need to ask ourselves if the reverse of the premise also implies the reverse of the conclusion. In other words, if we know that Sue was not at the wedding, can we conclude that Mary was not at the wedding?\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot make that conclusion based on the given statement alone. The statement only tells us that Mary's presence guarantees Sue's presence, but it does not provide any information about the absence of either Mary or Sue. Therefore, we cannot infer the converse of the statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
