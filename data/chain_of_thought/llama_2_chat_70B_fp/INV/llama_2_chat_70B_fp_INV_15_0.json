It implies that the occurrence of the event \"Sam took a plane\" is sufficient to conclude that the event \"Erin took a train\" has also occurred.\n\nTo determine if we can infer the negation of the statement, we need to apply the following rule of inference:\n\nModus Tollens (MT):\n\n1. If A, then B.\n2. Not B.\n3. Therefore, not A.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n1. If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. (A)\n2. Not Erin took a train. (not B)\n\nIf we apply MT, we can conclude that:\n\n3. Therefore, not Sam took a plane. (not A)\n\nSo, we can infer the negation of the statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" as \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
