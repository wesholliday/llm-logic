            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement, \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the face.\" It implies that the conclusion (Chris finished the face) follows logically from the premise (Alex finished the race).\n\nTo determine if we can infer the inverse, \"If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race,\" we need to assess whether the premise and conclusion are reversible. In other words, can we switch the premise and conclusion of the original statement without affecting its validity?\n\nIf we invert the premise and conclusion of the original statement, we get:\n\n\"If Chris finished the face, then Alex finished the race.\"\n\nThis inverted statement is still logically valid, as the conclusion (Alex finished the race) follows from the premise (Chris finished the face).\n\nTherefore, we can infer the inverse of the original statement:\n\n\"If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race.\"\n\nThis statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, and we can deduce it by simply inverting the premise and conclusion.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
