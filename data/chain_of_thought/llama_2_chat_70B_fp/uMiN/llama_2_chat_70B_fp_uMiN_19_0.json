In other words, the statement suggests that the watch's charging status on the dresser is uncertain.\n\nHowever, the statement does not provide enough information to infer that the watch must not be charging on the dresser. It's possible that the watch is indeed charging on the dresser, but the statement simply indicates that we don't know for sure.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we cannot infer that the watch must not be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: No.",
