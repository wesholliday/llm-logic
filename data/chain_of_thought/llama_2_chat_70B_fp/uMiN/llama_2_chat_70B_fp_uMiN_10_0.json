This means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the dog must have been inside.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the absence of evidence (in this case, the dog not being inside) does not necessarily mean that the dog was not inside. There could be various reasons why the dog was not found inside, such as it being in a different location or having left the area.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we cannot infer that it's not the case that the dog must have been inside.\n\nAnswer: No.",
