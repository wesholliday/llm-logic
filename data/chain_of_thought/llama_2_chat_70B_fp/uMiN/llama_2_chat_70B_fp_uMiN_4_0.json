This means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the alien must have visited Mars.\n\nHowever, it's also important to note that the absence of evidence does not necessarily mean that the alien did not visit Mars. There could be various reasons why we don't have evidence of the alien's visit to Mars, such as the alien's visit being a recent event, the alien not leaving any traces of their visit, or our lack of technology to detect the alien's presence.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we cannot infer that the alien must have visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: No.",
