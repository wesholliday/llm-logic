It does not necessarily mean that the shoes are not in the closet, but rather that we cannot assume with certainty that they are in the closet.\n\nIn order to infer that the shoes must be in the closet, we would need additional information or evidence that suggests that the shoes are indeed in the closet. Without such information, we cannot make that inference.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"the shoes might not be in the closet\" does not allow us to infer that the shoes must be in the closet.\n\nAnswer: No",
