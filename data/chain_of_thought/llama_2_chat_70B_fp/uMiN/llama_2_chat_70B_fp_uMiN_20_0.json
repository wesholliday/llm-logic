This statement does not necessarily mean that the sunglasses must be in her bag, as there are other possible locations where the sunglasses could be.\n\nHowever, the statement also does not rule out the possibility that the sunglasses are indeed in her bag. Without additional information, we cannot infer with certainty whether the sunglasses are in her bag or not.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.",
