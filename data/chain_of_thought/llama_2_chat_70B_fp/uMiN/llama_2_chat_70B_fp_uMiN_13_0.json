This statement does not necessarily mean that the toy must be in the toy box, as there are other possible locations where the toy could be.\n\nHowever, the statement also doesn't provide enough information to infer that the toy must not be in the toy box. Without additional information, we cannot rule out the possibility that the toy is indeed in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we cannot make a definitive inference about the location of the toy.\n\nAnswer: No.",
