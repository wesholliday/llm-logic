It does not necessarily mean that the scarf is not in the backpack, but rather that the speaker has doubts about its whereabouts.\n\nIn order to infer that the scarf must not be stuffed in the backpack, we would need additional information or evidence that suggests the scarf is not in the backpack. Without such information, we cannot make a definitive conclusion about the location of the scarf.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we cannot infer that the scarf must not be stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: No",
