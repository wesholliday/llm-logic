This means that the statement \"Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" is not necessarily true, as there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the statement \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\" does not necessarily mean that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. It only means that it's possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that it's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt. We can only infer that it's possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: No.",
