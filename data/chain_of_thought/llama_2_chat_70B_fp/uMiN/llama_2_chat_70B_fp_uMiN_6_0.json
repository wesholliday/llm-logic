This means that the statement \"Sue must have chosen pizza\" is not necessarily true, as there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the statement \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" does not necessarily mean that Sue did not choose pizza. It only means that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza, and we cannot infer with certainty that Sue did not choose pizza based on this statement alone.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza based solely on the statement \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\".\n\nAnswer: No",
