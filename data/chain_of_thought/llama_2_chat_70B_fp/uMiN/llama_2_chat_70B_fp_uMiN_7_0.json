This does not necessarily mean that Alex must have finished the race, as there is a possibility that they did not.\n\nIn order to infer that Alex must have finished the race, we would need additional information or evidence that confirms that they did indeed complete the race. Without this additional information, we cannot assume that Alex must have finished the race.\n\nAnswer: No",
