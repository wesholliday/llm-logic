We need to determine if we can infer \"The shank was not nugged\" from these statements.\n\nThe conditional statement implies that if the shank was plooked, then it was necessarily nugged. In other words, plooking implies nugging.\n\nSince the premise states that the shank was not plooked, we can conclude that it was not nugged. This is a valid inference because if the shank was not plooked, then it cannot be nugged, given the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The shank was not nugged\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
