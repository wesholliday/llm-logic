We need to determine if we can infer \"The glip was not tragged\" from these two statements.\n\nThe conditional statement implies that if the glip was slogged, then it was tragged. Since the premise states that the glip was not slogged, we can conclude that it was not tragged.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
