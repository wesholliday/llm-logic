            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on a conditional statement \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\" and a negation statement \"The whiffle was not shanked\".\n\nWhen we negate a conditional statement, we invert the order of the premises and the conclusion. So, the negation of \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\" becomes \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\".\n\nNow, we are given the premise \"The whiffle was not shanked\". By modus tollens, we can conclude that \"The whiffle did not tink\".\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
