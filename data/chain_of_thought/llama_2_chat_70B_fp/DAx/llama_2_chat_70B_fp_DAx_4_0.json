The fribble was not snurgled.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the fribble was snurgled, then it crinked. However, premise 2 states that the fribble was not snurgled. Therefore, we cannot infer that the fribble crinked.\n\nIn fact, we can infer the opposite, that the fribble did not crink, since the premises suggest that the fribble was not in a state that would cause it to crink.\n\nAnswer:\nNo.",
