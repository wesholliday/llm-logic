We need to determine if we can infer \"The sprocket was not daggled\" based on these two statements.\n\nThe conditional statement implies that if the sprocket was cranked, then it was daggled. Since the premise states that the sprocket was not cranked, we can conclude that it was not daggled.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
