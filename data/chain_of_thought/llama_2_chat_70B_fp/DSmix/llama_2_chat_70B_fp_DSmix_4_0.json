The fribble might not be crinked (denoted as MFNC)\n\nFrom EFS, we can deduce that the fribble is either snurgled or crinked.\n\nFrom MFNC, we know that the fribble might not be crinked. This means that the possibility of the fribble being crinked is not certain, and thus we cannot deduce that the fribble is crinked.\n\nSince we have already deduced that the fribble is either snurgled or crinked, and we have established that it might not be crinked, we can conclude that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
