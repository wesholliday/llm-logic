            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe first premise \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened\" presents two exclusive options for the state of the dreb. If the dreb is not vroombed, then it must be spened.\n\nThe second premise \"The dreb might not be spened\" indicates that the dreb's state is not necessarily spened. This means that the dreb could be in either state, vroombed or spened.\n\nSince the dreb might not be spened, we cannot conclusively say that it is spened. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
