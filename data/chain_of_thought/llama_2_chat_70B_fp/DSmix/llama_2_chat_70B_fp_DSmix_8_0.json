The phrase \"The sprocket might not be daggled\" indicates that the sprocket may not be in the daggled state.\n\nIf the sprocket is not in the daggled state, then it must be in the cranked state, as these are the only two possible states according to the premise. Therefore, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
