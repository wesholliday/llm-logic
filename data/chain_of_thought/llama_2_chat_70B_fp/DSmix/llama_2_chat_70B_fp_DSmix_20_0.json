If the fleeg is not bluttered, then it must be surned. The second premise \"The fleeg might not be surned\" indicates that the second option, the fleeg being surned, is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, by process of elimination, we can conclude that the first option, the fleeg being bluttered, is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
