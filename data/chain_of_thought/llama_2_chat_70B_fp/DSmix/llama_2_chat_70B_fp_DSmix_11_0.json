The sentence \"The flug might not be zimmed\" indicates that the flug may not be in the state of being zimmed.\n\nIf the flug is not zimmed, then it must be blummed, since the only other option is that it is zimmed, and we have already established that it might not be zimmed. Therefore, we can infer that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
