The sentence \"The smip might not be lupped\" indicates that the smip may not be in the state of being lupped.\n\nIf the smip is not lupped, then it must be shripped, since these are the only two possible states according to the first premise. Therefore, we can infer that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
