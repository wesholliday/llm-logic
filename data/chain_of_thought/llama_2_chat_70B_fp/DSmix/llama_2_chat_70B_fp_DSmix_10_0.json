If the wug is not sproinged, then it must be garpled.\n\nThe second premise \"The wug might not be garpled\" indicates that the possibility of the wug being garpled is not certain.\n\nIf we combine these two premises, we can conclude that if the wug is not garpled, then it must be sproinged, as it is the only remaining option.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
