The sentence \"The grommet might not be plopped\" indicates that the grommet may not be in the plopped state.\n\nIf the grommet is not in the plopped state, then it must be in the sploffed state, as these are the only two possible states according to the first premise. Therefore, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
