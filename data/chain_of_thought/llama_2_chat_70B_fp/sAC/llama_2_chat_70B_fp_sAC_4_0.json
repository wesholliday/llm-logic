If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter (by Premise 1). However, we know that the robot did visit Jupiter (by Premise 2), which means that our assumption that the alien did not visit Mars leads to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, we must conclude that the alien did visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
