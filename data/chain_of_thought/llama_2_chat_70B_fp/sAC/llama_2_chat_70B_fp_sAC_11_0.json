The muffins were blueberry.\n\nWe need to determine whether the conclusion \"The cake was chocolate\" follows logically from these premises.\n\nLet's break down the first statement:\n\n1. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n\nThis statement implies that the cake being chocolate is sufficient to guarantee that the muffins are blueberry. In other words, if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement:\n\n2. The muffins were blueberry.\n\nThis statement asserts that the muffins are indeed blueberry.\n\nNow, let's put the two statements together:\n\n1. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n2. The muffins were blueberry.\n\nGiven that the muffins are blueberry (statement 2), it follows that the cake must have been chocolate (statement 1). In other words, if the muffins are blueberry, then the cake must have been chocolate.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The cake was chocolate\" logically follows from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
