            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statements are:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n2. The banana was yellow.\n\nWe need to determine whether the conclusion \"The apple was red\" follows logically from these premises.\n\nLet's break down the first statement:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nThis statement implies that the apple's redness is sufficient to guarantee the banana's yellowness. In other words, if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement:\n\n2. The banana was yellow.\n\nThis statement asserts that the banana had the property of yellowness.\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can conclude that the premises imply the conclusion:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n2. The banana was yellow.\n\nTherefore, the apple must have been red.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
