The book is a mystery novel.\n\nWe want to determine whether the conclusion \"The book was written by James\" follows logically from these premises.\n\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\nThis premise tells us that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. In other words, if the book is not a mystery novel, then it cannot have been written by James.\n2. The book is a mystery novel.\nThis premise tells us that the book in question is indeed a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's put these two premises together:\n\nIf the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (premise 1).\nThe book is a mystery novel (premise 2).\n\nGiven these two premises, we can logically conclude that the book was written by James. Therefore, the conclusion \"The book was written by James\" follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
