It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that it's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink. This means that the sneg did not sprot the frink.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the sneg was crampled. If the sneg was crampled, then according to premise 1, the sneg must have sproted the frink. However, we know from premise 2 that the sneg did not sprot the frink. This means that the sneg cannot have been crampled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
