It's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed. However, premise 2 states that it's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed. This means that the flug cannot have been zimmed, and therefore, it cannot have been blummed either.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
