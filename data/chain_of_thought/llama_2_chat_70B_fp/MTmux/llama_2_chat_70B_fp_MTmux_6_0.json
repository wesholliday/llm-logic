It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that it's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink. This means that the grommet did not plopped the frink.\n\nSince the grommet did not plopped the frink, and if the grommet was sploffed, then it would have plopped the frink, we can infer that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
