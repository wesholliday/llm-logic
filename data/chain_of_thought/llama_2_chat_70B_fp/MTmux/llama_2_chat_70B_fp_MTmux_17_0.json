In this case, the negation of \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated\" is \"If the flob must have movated, then the flob was skizzled\".\n\nNow, we are given the premise \"It's not the case that the flob must have movated\", which is the negation of the conclusion of the conditional statement. Therefore, we can infer that the premise of the conditional statement, \"the flob was skizzled\", must be false.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
