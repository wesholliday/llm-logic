It's not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the zinger was fraggled, then it must have been smoogled. However, premise 2 states that it's not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled. This means that the conclusion that the zinger must have been smoogled is not valid.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the zinger was not fraggled, as the premises suggest that the zinger could not have been smoogled if it was fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
