It's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that it's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned.\n\nNow, let's consider two possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The fleeg was bluttered.\nIn this scenario, premise 1 tells us that the fleeg must have been surned. However, premise 2 states that it's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned, which means that the fleeg cannot have been surned. This leads to a contradiction, as we have concluded that the fleeg must have been surned and cannot have been surned at the same time.\n\nScenario 2: The fleeg was not bluttered.\nIn this scenario, premise 1 does not apply, as the fleeg was not bluttered. Therefore, we cannot infer that the fleeg must have been surned. However, premise 2 still holds, as it states that it's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
