It's not the case that the fribble must have crinked.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that it's not the case that the fribble must have crinked.\n\nBy negating premise 2, we get:\nIt's not the case that the fribble must not have crinked.\n\nNow, we can use modus tollens on premises 1 and 2 to arrive at the conclusion:\n\nIf the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked.\nIt's not the case that the fribble must have crinked.\nTherefore, it's not the case that the fribble was snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
