It's not the case that the glip must have tragged.\n\nWe want to infer whether the glip was slogged or not.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if the glip was slogged, then it must have tragged. This means that if the glip did not tragg, then it was not slogged.\n\nPremise 2 states that it's not the case that the glip must have tragged. This means that we cannot conclude that the glip must have tragged.\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer that if the glip must have tragged, then it was slogged. However, since we know that it's not the case that the glip must have tragged, we can conclude that it was not slogged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
