It's not the case that the wug must have been garpled.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that it's not the case that the wug must have been garpled.\n\nNow, let's consider two possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The wug was sproinged.\nIn this scenario, premise 1 tells us that the wug must have been garpled. However, premise 2 states that it's not the case that the wug must have been garpled, which means that the wug cannot have been garpled. This leads to a contradiction, as we have concluded that the wug must have been garpled and cannot have been garpled at the same time.\n\nScenario 2: The wug was not sproinged.\nIn this scenario, premise 1 does not apply, as the wug was not sproinged. Therefore, we cannot infer that the wug must have been garpled. However, premise 2 still holds, as it states that it's not the case that the wug must have been garpled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
