It's not the case that the smonk must have plagged.\n\nWe want to infer whether the smonk was vreebled or not.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if the smonk was vreebled, then it must have plagged. This means that if the smonk did not plag, then it was not vreebled.\n\nPremise 2 states that it's not the case that the smonk must have plagged. This means that we cannot conclude that the smonk must have plagged.\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer that if the smonk must have plagged, then it was vreebled. However, since we know that it's not the case that the smonk must have plagged, we can conclude that it was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
