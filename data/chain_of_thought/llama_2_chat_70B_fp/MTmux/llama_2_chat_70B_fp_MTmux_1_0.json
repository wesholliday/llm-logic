It's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the flugel was blimmed, then it must have been zargled.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that it's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled.\n\nNow, let's consider two possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The flugel was blimmed.\nIn this scenario, premise 1 tells us that the flugel must have been zargled. However, premise 2 states that it's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled, which means that the flugel cannot have been zargled. This leads to a contradiction, as we have inferred that the flugel must have been zargled, but premise 2 tells us that it cannot have been zargled.\n\nScenario 2: The flugel was not blimmed.\nIn this scenario, premise 1 does not apply, as the flugel was not blimmed. Therefore, we cannot infer that the flugel must have been zargled. However, premise 2 still holds, as it states that it's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
