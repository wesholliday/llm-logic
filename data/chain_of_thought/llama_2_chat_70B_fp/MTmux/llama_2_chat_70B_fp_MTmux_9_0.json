It's not the case that the twonk must have been varnished.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that it's not the case that the twonk must have been varnished.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the twonk was plinked. If the twonk was plinked, then by premise 1, it must have been varnished. However, this contradicts premise 2, which states that it's not the case that the twonk must have been varnished.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
