It implies that the presence of the griffin in the forest implies the presence of the unicorn in the forest.\n\nThe statement \"The griffin was in the forest\" is a declarative sentence stating a fact.\n\nTo infer that the unicorn was in the forest, we need to use modus ponens, a logical rule that states that if a conditional statement is true and its antecedent is true, then its consequent must be true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" The antecedent of the conditional statement is \"the griffin was in the forest,\" which is true according to the second statement. Therefore, we can infer that the consequent of the conditional statement, \"the unicorn was in the forest,\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
