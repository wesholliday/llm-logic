It implies that the dog's location (inside) is sufficient to determine the cat's location (outside).\n\nThe statement \"Also, the dog was inside\" provides additional information that the dog was indeed inside.\n\nUsing modus ponens, a logical rule of inference, we can conclude that the cat was outside. Modus ponens states that if a conditional statement is true and the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is true, then the consequent (the \"then\" part) must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside,\" and the antecedent is \"the dog was inside,\" which is true. Therefore, we can infer that the consequent, \"the cat was outside,\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
