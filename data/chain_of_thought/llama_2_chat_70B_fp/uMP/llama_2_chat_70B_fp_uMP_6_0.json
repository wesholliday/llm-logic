Specifically, it means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nAdditionally, the statement \"Sue chose pizza\" provides us with information about Sue's choice, but it doesn't directly tell us anything about Bob's choice.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Bob chose pasta, because Sue chose pizza and the conditional statement implies that this means Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
