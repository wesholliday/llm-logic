It implies that Sue's presence at the wedding is dependent on Mary's presence. In other words, if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding too.\n\nThe statement \"Mary was at the wedding\" is a fact. It tells us that Mary was present at the wedding.\n\nUsing the first statement, we can infer that since Mary was at the wedding, Sue must have been at the wedding too. This is because the first statement tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
