In other words, if the alien visited Mars, then it is certain that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nThe statement \"It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter\" implies that the robot's visit to Jupiter is not a necessary consequence of the alien's visit to Mars. In other words, even if the alien visited Mars, it is not certain that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can see that the alien's visit to Mars does not necessarily lead to the robot's visit to Jupiter. Therefore, we cannot infer that the alien did not visit Mars based on the fact that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: No",
