Specifically, if the car is red, then the truck must be blue.\n\nThe second statement \"Also, it's not the case that the truck must have been blue\" indicates that the truck's color is not necessarily blue, and it could be any other color.\n\nFrom the two statements, we can infer that the car's color is not red, because if it were red, then the truck would have to be blue, which is not the case.\n\nAnswer: No",
