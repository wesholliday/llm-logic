However, the second statement tells us that it's not necessary that Jen watched basketball. This means that the first statement is not necessarily true, and we cannot conclude that Tom watched football.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Tom did not watch football. The lack of information about Tom's activity does not allow us to make any conclusions about his behavior.\n\nAnswer: No.",
