In other words, the statement only establishes a one-way inference from the shirt's material to the pants' material, and not the other way around.\n\nThe second statement \"Also, it's not the case that the pants must have been denim\" implies that the pants could have been made of any material other than denim, including cotton.\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton, because if it were cotton, then the pants would have been denim, which is not the case.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
