However, the statement \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\" indicates that the truck's material is not necessarily metal.\n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can see that the doll being plastic would not necessarily mean that the truck is metal, as the truck's material is not fixed. Therefore, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No.",
