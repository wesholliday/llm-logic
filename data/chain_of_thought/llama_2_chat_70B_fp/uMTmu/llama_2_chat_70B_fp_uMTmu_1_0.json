It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\nFrom 1, we can infer that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\nFrom 2, we know that it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding, which means that Sue might or might not have been at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that Mary was at the wedding. If Mary was at the wedding, then by 1, Sue must have been at the wedding too. However, this contradicts 2, which states that it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No.",
