This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the first part (Sue choosing pizza) is true, then the second part (Bob choosing pasta) must also be true.\n2. It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta. This means that the second part of the conditional statement (Bob choosing pasta) is not necessarily true.\n3. We can infer that Sue did not choose pizza. This is a conclusion we can draw based on the first two points. If Sue had chosen pizza, then Bob would have had to choose pasta, but since Bob did not choose pasta, Sue must not have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: No.",
