This means that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race either.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race. This means that it's possible that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. Alex finished the race, and Chris finished the race. In this scenario, both Alex and Chris finished the race, which contradicts the second statement.\n2. Alex finished the race, and Chris did not finish the race. In this scenario, Alex finished the race, but Chris did not, which is consistent with the second statement.\n3. Alex did not finish the race, and Chris finished the race. In this scenario, Alex did not finish the race, and Chris did finish the race, which contradicts the first statement.\n4. Alex did not finish the race, and Chris did not finish the race. In this scenario, neither Alex nor Chris finished the race, which is consistent with both statements.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
