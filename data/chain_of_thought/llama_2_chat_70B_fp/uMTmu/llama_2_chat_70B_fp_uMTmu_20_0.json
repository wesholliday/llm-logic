            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" is a conditional statement. The conditional statement implies that the color of the banana is dependent on the color of the apple. If the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow, but if the apple is not red, then the banana can be any color.\n\nThe second statement \"Also, it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow\" implies that the banana is not necessarily yellow. This statement does not provide any information about the color of the apple.\n\nTo infer that the apple was not red, we need to use the first statement and the fact that the banana is not necessarily yellow. If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow, but since the banana is not necessarily yellow, it means that the apple cannot have been red.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
