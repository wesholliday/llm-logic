In other words, if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not have to buy the blue shirt.\n\nThe statement \"Also, it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" implies that Mark's purchase of the blue shirt is not necessary. In other words, Mark could have bought a different shirt or no shirt at all.\n\nIf we combine these two statements, we can see that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt, but since Mark's purchase of the blue shirt is not necessary, it means that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
