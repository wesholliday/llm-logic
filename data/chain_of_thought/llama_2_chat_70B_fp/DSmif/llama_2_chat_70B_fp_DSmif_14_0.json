The second premise \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge\" implies that the milk is not necessarily in the fridge, which means that the second option \"it is on the counter\" becomes more probable.\n\nSince the second premise weakens the conclusion of the first premise, we can infer that the milk might be on the counter. However, we cannot say for certain that the milk is on the counter without additional information.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
