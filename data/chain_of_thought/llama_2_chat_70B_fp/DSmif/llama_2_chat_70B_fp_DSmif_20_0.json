The second premise \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" implies that the first option, the sunglasses being perched on her head, is not necessarily true.\n\nIf the sunglasses are not perched on her head, then the only remaining option is that they are in her bag. Therefore, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
