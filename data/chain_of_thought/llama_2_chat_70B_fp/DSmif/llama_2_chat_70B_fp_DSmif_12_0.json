The second premise \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" implies that the first option, the jacket being hanging in the closet, is not certain.\n\nIf the jacket is not hanging in the closet, then the second option, the jacket being draped over the chair, becomes the only possible location for the jacket. Therefore, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
