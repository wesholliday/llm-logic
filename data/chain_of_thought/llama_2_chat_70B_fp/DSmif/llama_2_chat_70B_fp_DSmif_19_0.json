The sentence \"The watch might not be on his wrist\" implies that the watch is not necessarily on his wrist, which means that the second option, \"it is charging on the dresser,\" becomes more plausible.\n\nSince the watch might not be on his wrist, it increases the likelihood that it is charging on the dresser. However, we cannot confirm this inference with certainty without additional information.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
