The converse of the statement would be:\n\n\"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nThis converse statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if the conclusion (spened) is false, then the hypothesis (vroombed) must also be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the converse statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
