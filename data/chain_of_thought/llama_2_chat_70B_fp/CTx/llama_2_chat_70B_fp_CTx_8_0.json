The converse of \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" would be \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\".\n\nThis converse statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the converse statement must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\" from the given statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
