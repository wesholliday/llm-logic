The converse of the statement would be:\n\n\"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\"\n\nThis converse statement asserts that if the flug was not zimmed, then it must not have been blummed.\n\nTo determine if we can infer the converse from the given statement, we need to check if the converse statement logically follows from the given statement.\n\nIf we assume that the flug was not zimmed, then by the given statement, it must not have been blummed. Therefore, the converse statement logically follows from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
