The converse of the statement would be:\n\n\"If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nThis converse statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the conclusion of the original statement is true, then the conclusion of the converse statement must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
