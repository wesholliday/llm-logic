The converse of the statement would be:\n\n\"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\"\n\nThis converse statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if the conclusion of the original statement (the wug bimmed the zoint) is false, then the premise of the original statement (the wug was flooped) must also be false. Therefore, we can infer the converse statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
