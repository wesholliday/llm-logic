However, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. In other words, just because the glip was not tragged, it does not mean that it was not slogged.\n\nTo infer the converse of the statement, we need to negate the original statement. The negation of \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\" is \"If the glip was not slogged, then the glip was not tragged.\" This negation is a contrapositive statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
