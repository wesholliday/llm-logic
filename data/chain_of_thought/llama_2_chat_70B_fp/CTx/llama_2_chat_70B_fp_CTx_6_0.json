The contrapositive of a statement is obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion, and then negating the conclusion. In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" would be:\n\nIf the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
