            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" can be represented as:\n\nSproinged \u2192 Garpled\n\nThis statement indicates that if the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled. However, it does not explicitly state that if the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged.\n\nTo infer the desired statement \"If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged,\" we need to use modus tollens, a logical rule that allows us to deduce the negation of the consequent from the negation of the antecedent.\n\nModus tollens:\n\n\u00acGarpled \u2192 \u00acSproinged\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n\u00acGarpled (the wug was not garpled)\n\nApplying modus tollens, we can deduce:\n\n\u00acSproinged (the wug was not sproinged)\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
