The converse of the statement would be:\n\n\"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed.\"\n\nTo determine if this converse is true, we need to assess whether the negation of the conclusion (quanking) implies the negation of the hypothesis (morphing).\n\nIf the splat did not quank, it means that the splat did not undergo the process of quanking. However, this does not necessarily mean that the splat was not morphed. It is possible that the splat was morphed, but it did not quank.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
