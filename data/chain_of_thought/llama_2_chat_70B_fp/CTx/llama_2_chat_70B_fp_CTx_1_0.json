If blimming implies zargling, then we can infer that if the flugel was not zargled, it must not have been blimmed.\n\nHowever, we cannot assume that the converse is true without additional information. It's possible that there are other factors that could prevent the flugel from being zargled, even if it was blimmed. For example, perhaps the flugel was blimmed but then later became un-blimmed, or maybe there is a third factor that prevents the flugel from being zargled even if it is blimmed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the converse of the given statement without additional information or context.\n\nAnswer: No.",
