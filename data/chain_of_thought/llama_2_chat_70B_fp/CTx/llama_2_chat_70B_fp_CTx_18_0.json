In other words, if the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged.\n\nTo determine if we can infer the converse of this statement, we need to examine the relationship between plooking and nugging. If plooking implies nugging, then it's possible that not nugging implies not plooking. However, we cannot conclude this definitively without additional information.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario where the shank was not nugged, but it was still plooked. In this case, the converse inference would not hold, as the shank was plooked even though it was not nugged. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked\" directly from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
