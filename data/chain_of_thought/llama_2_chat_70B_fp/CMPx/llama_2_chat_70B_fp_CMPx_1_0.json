    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a dasetil, a lentum, and a vifali are competing to be this year's batalit. The dasetil is the most likely to become the batalit, followed closely by the lentum, with the vifali trailing way behind. Since these are the only competitors, if the lentum isn\u2019t the batalit, then if the dasetil isn\u2019t the batalit, the vifali will be. Since the dasetil is ahead, the lentum most likely won\u2019t be the batalit. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the dasetil isn\u2019t the batalit, the vifali will be?",

            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information can be represented as follows:\n\n* The dasetil is the most likely to become the batalit.\n* The lentum is the second most likely to become the batalit, and is closely behind the dasetil.\n* The vifali is the least likely to become the batalit, and is trailing way behind the dasetil and lentum.\n\nWe can deduce the following conclusions from the given information:\n\n1. If the lentum isn\u2019t the batalit, then the vifali will be, since the dasetil is ahead of both the lentum and the vifali.\n2. Since the dasetil is ahead of the lentum, it is likely that the lentum won\u2019t be the batalit.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the question:\n\nDoes it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the dasetil isn\u2019t the batalit, the vifali will be?\n\nBased on the deduced conclusions, it seems likely that if the dasetil isn\u2019t the batalit, the vifali will be, since the lentum is unlikely to be the batalit. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
