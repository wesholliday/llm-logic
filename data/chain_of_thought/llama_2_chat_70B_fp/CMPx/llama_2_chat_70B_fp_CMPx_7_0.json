    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crastin, a nivet, and a jomial are the top bispets this breeding season. Breeders expect the crastin likely will birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. These lead in birthing, so if the nivet doesn\u2019t birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn\u2019t, the jomial will. Moreover, the crastin likely will lead births and hence the nivet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, the jomial will?",

If the nivet doesn\u2019t birth the most offspring, then the crastin will. Therefore, it is likely that the crastin will lead births.\n\nHowever, if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, then it is possible that the nivet could lead births. But since the nivet is expected to birth fewer offspring than the crastin, it is still likely that the crastin will lead births.\n\nTherefore, it is not necessarily true that if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, the jomial will. It is possible that the nivet could lead births instead.\n\nAnswer: No.",
