    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

If the jantiz doesn't get it, then the cramen will, and if the cramen doesn't get it, then the sulect will.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that the jantiz doesn't get the zulision. In this case, the cramen will get it, according to the information given. Therefore, if the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, the sulect will not get it, because the cramen will take the spot.\n\nAnswer: No.",
