    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fraglen, a darpil, and a votal are the top bispil teams this season. The fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, while the votal trails far behind. These lead the league, so if the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn\u2019t, the votal will. Moreover, the fraglen likely will lead the league and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fraglen doesn\u2019t lead the league, the votal will?",

We can do this by analyzing the conditions under which the votal will lead the league:\n\n* If the darpil leads the league, then the votal will have the top record.\n* If the fraglen does not lead the league, then the darpil will not lead the league either.\n\nGiven that the fraglen likely will lead the league, it is less likely that the darpil will lead the league. Therefore, the condition under which the votal will lead the league (i.e., the darpil leading the league) is less likely to occur.\n\nHence, it is unlikely that the votal will lead the league if the fraglen does not.\n\nAnswer: No.",
