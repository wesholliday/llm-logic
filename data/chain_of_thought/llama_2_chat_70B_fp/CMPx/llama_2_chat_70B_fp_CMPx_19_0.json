    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a garplex, a beelhet, and a peedonk are competing to be domer of the year. Experts think the garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, with the peedonk having a much lower chance. Since these are the only domer candidates, if the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer. Moreover, it is likely the garplex will become domer and hence the beelhet likely won\u2019t become domer. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will?",

If the garplex doesn't become domer, then according to the third statement, the peedonk will become domer. However, this is only possible if the beelhet doesn't become domer, which is likely, given the information that the garplex is most likely to win and the beelhet likely won't become domer.\n\nTherefore, it follows that if the garplex doesn't become domer, it is likely that the peedonk will become domer.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
