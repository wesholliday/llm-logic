    "user_prompt": "Suppose a flinker, a dringen, and a n\u00fcffen have the best projections to have a breakout season next year. Talent scouts believe it's highly probable the flinker will have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen, while the n\u00fcffen is an outside shot. Since these are the only top prospects, if the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. Moreover, scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season and hence the dringen likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will?",

Talent scouts believe it's highly probable the flinker will have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen.\n3. The n\u00fcffen is an outside shot.\n4. If the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season.\n5. Scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season and hence the dringen likely won't.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the conclusion: Does it follow that it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will?\n\nWe know that the flinker and dringen are considered more likely to have a breakout season than the n\u00fcffen. If the dringen doesn't have a breakout season, then the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season, according to the given information. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will.\n\nThere are three possible scenarios:\n\n1. The flinker has a breakout season, and the dringen doesn't. In this case, the n\u00fcffen won't have a breakout season.\n2. The flinker doesn't have a breakout season, and the dringen does. In this case, the n\u00fcffen won't have a breakout season.\n3. The flinker and dringen both don't have a breakout season. In this case, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season, according to the given information.\n\nSince there are two scenarios where the n\u00fcffen doesn't have a breakout season, and only one scenario where the n\u00fcffen does, it's not likely that if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will.\n\nAnswer: No.",
