The truck was metal.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that the doll was plastic if the truck was metal. However, we cannot conclude that the doll was plastic based solely on statement 2, as it only tells us that the truck was metal.\n\nTo determine whether the doll was plastic, we need to use both statements together. We know that the truck was metal (statement 2), and if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal (statement 1). Therefore, we can conclude that the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
