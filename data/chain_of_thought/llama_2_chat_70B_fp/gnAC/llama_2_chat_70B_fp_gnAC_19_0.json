This means that the consequent of the statement is true.\n\nUsing modus ponens, a logical rule of inference, we can conclude that if the antecedent (Tom watched football) and the consequent (Jen watched basketball) of a conditional statement are both true, then the statement as a whole is true.\n\nTherefore, since both the antecedent and consequent of the statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" are true, we can conclude that the statement is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
