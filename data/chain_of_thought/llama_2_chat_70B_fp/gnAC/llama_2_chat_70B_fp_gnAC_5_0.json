            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information can be represented as follows:\n\n* Premise 1: If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n* Premise 2: Amy played tennis.\n\nWe want to determine whether the conclusion \"Jeff played basketball\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nLet's first assume that the premises are true. If Premise 1 is true, then we know that whenever Jeff plays basketball, Amy plays tennis. In other words, the occurrence of Jeff playing basketball implies the occurrence of Amy playing tennis.\n\nNow, let's consider Premise 2. We know that Amy played tennis. This means that the condition specified in Premise 1 (Jeff playing basketball) must have been met, since Amy playing tennis is the consequence of Jeff playing basketball. In other words, if Amy played tennis, then Jeff must have played basketball.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can logically conclude that Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
