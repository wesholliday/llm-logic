Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. However, we don't know if Joe actually went to the park.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Lucy went to the zoo. This doesn't tell us anything about Joe's whereabouts.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: Does it necessarily follow that 'Joe went to the park' is true?\n\nIf we assume that 'Joe went to the park' is true, then we can deduce that Lucy went to the zoo, based on statement 1. However, we already know that Lucy went to the zoo, based on statement 2.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that 'Joe went to the park' is true, given the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
