The cat was outside.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can deduce that if the dog was inside, then the cat must be outside. However, we also know that the cat was outside, according to statement 2. Therefore, it is possible that the dog was inside, since the cat being outside does not necessarily mean that the dog cannot be inside.\n\nIn other words, the statements do not necessarily imply that the dog was inside. There could be other scenarios where the cat is outside, but the dog is not inside. For example, both the dog and cat could be outside, or the dog could be inside and the cat could be outside.\n\nAnswer: No.",
