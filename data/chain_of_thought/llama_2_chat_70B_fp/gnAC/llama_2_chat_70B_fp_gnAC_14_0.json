The wolf was in the den.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can deduce that the bear was in the cave if and only if the wolf was in the den. In other words, the bear's presence in the cave is conditional on the wolf's presence in the den.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the wolf was in the den. Therefore, we can conclude that the bear was in the cave, since the wolf's presence in the den implies the bear's presence in the cave.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
