It allows for the possibility that the newspaper might not be in the driveway, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's not there.\n\nIn order to infer \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway,\" we would need additional information or context that suggests the newspaper cannot be in the driveway. Without such information, we can only conclude that the newspaper might or might not be in the driveway.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway\" directly from \"The newspaper might not be in the driveway.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
