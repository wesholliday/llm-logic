It does not necessarily mean that the vampire must have been awake, as there is a possibility that the vampire was not awake.\n\nIn order to infer \"It's not the case that the vampire must have been awake,\" we need to consider the opposite of the original statement. If the opposite of \"The vampire might not have been awake\" is \"The vampire must have been awake,\" then we can infer that the original statement does not imply that the vampire must have been awake.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the vampire must have been awake.\n\nAnswer: No",
