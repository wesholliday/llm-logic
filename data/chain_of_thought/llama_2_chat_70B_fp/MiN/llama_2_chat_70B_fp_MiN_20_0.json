It suggests that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not in her bag.\n\nIf we were to infer \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag\" from the given statement, we would be making a logical leap. The original statement only tells us that the sunglasses might not be in her bag, but it doesn't necessarily mean that they must not be in her bag.\n\nIn other words, the negation of \"The sunglasses might be in her bag\" is not necessarily \"The sunglasses must not be in her bag,\" but rather \"The sunglasses might not be in her bag.\"\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag\" directly from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
