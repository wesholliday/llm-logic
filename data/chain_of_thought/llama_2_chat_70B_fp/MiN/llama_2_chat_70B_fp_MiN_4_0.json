This does not necessarily mean that it's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars. In other words, the negation of \"The alien must have visited Mars\" is not necessarily implied by \"The alien might not have visited Mars.\"\n\nFor example, consider the statement \"The person might not have eaten breakfast.\" This does not necessarily mean that it's not the case that the person must have eaten breakfast. It's possible that the person did eat breakfast, but we're simply unsure or have no information to confirm it.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars\" from \"The alien might not have visited Mars.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
