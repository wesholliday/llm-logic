This means that the negation of the statement \"Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" is true.\n\nIn other words, if \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\" is true, then \"Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" cannot be true. Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" from \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
