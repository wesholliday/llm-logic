This means that we cannot say with certainty that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nInference is a process of drawing a conclusion based on evidence or premises. In this case, the premise is \"Mary might not have been at the wedding,\" and the conclusion we are trying to draw is \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\"\n\nIf we were to infer that Mary must have been at the wedding, we would be implying that there is no possibility that Mary did not attend the wedding, which contradicts the given statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No",
