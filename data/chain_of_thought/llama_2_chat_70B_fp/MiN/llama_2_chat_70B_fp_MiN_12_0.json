This means that the negation of the statement \"The jacket must be draped over the chair\" is also a possible scenario. In other words, the statement \"The jacket might not be draped over the chair\" suggests that the necessity of the jacket being draped over the chair is not absolute.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair\" from the statement \"The jacket might not be draped over the chair\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
