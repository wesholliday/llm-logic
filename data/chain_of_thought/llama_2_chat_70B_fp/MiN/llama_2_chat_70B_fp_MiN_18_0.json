This means that we cannot conclude with certainty that the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\nIn other words, the phrase \"might not be\" indicates a possibility or an uncertainty, which implies that the opposite possibility (i.e., the notebook must be in the drawer) is also a valid option. Therefore, we cannot infer that the notebook must be in the drawer based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
