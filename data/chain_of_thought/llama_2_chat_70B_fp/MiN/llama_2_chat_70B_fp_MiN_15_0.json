This statement does not directly imply that the shoes must not be in the closet, as there is still a possibility that they are in the closet. However, we can infer that the speaker believes that the shoes might not be in the closet, which means that the speaker does not have certain knowledge that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: No",
