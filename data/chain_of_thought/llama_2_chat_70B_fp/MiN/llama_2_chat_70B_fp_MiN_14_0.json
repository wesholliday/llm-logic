It does not necessarily mean that the milk must not be on the counter, but rather that its location is not confirmed.\n\nTo infer that \"It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter\" from the original statement, we would need additional information or context that suggests the milk cannot be on the counter. Without such information, we cannot rule out the possibility that the milk is indeed on the counter.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"The milk might not be on the counter\" does not allow us to infer that the milk must not be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: No",
