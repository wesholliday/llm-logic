It does not necessarily mean that the griffin was not in the forest, but rather that we cannot be sure whether it was or not.\n\nTo infer \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\" from the original statement, we need to consider the possibility that the griffin was not in the forest. If it's possible that the griffin was not in the forest, then it's not necessary that it must have been in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\" from the statement \"The griffin might not have been in the forest\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
