            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the premise being \"If I water the plants, they will grow\" and the conclusion being \"If I water the plants and there is no sunlight, they will grow.\" In order for this argument to be logically valid, the conclusion must follow logically from the premise.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is valid, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the conditional statement in the premise: \"If I water the plants, they will grow.\"\n2. Negate the conclusion: \"If I water the plants and there is no sunlight, they will not grow.\"\n3. Determine whether the negated conclusion is the opposite of the premise. If it is, then the argument is valid.\n\nIn this case, the negated conclusion \"If I water the plants and there is no sunlight, they will not grow\" is indeed the opposite of the premise \"If I water the plants, they will grow.\" Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
