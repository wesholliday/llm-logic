In other words, if you get enough sleep, then you won't be tired.\n* Conclusion: \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired\"\nThis conclusion is stating that both getting enough sleep and doing hard labor are sufficient conditions for not being tired. In other words, if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, then you won't be tired.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the argument:\n\n1. If the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n2. The premise is true, because getting enough sleep is indeed a sufficient condition for not being tired.\n3. Therefore, the conclusion must also be true, and it logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
