The conclusion adds a new condition, \"and I am wearing earplugs,\" to the premise. If we assume that the premise is true, then it logically follows that if the speaker is wearing earplugs, their ears will still be hurt by the screaming, as earplugs do not negate the effect of loud noises on the ears.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premise, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
