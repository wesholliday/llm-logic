When we negate this statement, we are essentially saying that it is not necessary or obligatory for the sneg to have been crampled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that it is possible for the sneg not to have been crampled. This possibility is conveyed by the phrase \"the sneg might not have been crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
