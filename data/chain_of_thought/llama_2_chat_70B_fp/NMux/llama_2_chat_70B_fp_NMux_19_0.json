However, the first part of the statement negates this idea by saying that it's not the case that the vreebling of the smonk is a certainty.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the vreebling of the smonk is not a certainty, and it's possible that the smonk might not have been vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
