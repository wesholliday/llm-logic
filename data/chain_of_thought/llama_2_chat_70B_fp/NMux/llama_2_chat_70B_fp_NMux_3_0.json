However, if we negate the second part of the statement, we get \"the splat need not have been morphed,\" which implies that the splat might not have undergone a transformation.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The splat might not have been morphed\" from \"It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
