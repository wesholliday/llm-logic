The second part is a conditional statement, where \"the flugel must have been blimmed\" is the consequence of the condition \"it's the case that.\"\n\nTherefore, the negation of the original statement would be \"It is the case that the flugel might not have been blimmed.\" This is because the negation of \"it's not the case that\" is \"it is the case that,\" and the negation of \"the flugel must have been blimmed\" is \"the flugel might not have been blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
