By negating this statement, we are essentially saying that it's not necessary or obligatory for the shank to have been plooked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that it's possible or permissible for the shank not to have been plooked. In other words, \"The shank might not have been plooked\" is a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
