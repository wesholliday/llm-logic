Therefore, negating this statement implies that it is not necessary or possible that the fribble was snurgled.\n\nSo, we can infer that \"The fribble might not have been snurgled\" because the negation of \"the fribble must have been snurgled\" implies that it is possible that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
