The second part is a negation of the phrase \"the fleeg has been bluttered.\"\n\nWhen we negate a statement, we switch the polarity of the statement, meaning that if the statement was true, its negation is false, and vice versa. Therefore, \"the fleeg must have been bluttered\" becomes \"the fleeg might not have been bluttered\" when negated.\n\nSo, we can infer \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered\" from \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
