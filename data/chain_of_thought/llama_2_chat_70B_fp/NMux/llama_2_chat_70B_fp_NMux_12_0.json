In this case, the second part states that the smip must have been shripped.\n\nBy negating the first part, we can infer that the situation described in the second part is not necessarily false or impossible. In other words, it's possible that the smip might have been shripped.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The smip might not have been shripped\" from \"It's not the case that the smip must have been shripped.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
