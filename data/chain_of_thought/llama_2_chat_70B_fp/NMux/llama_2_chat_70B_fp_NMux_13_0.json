In this case, the second part states that the glip must have been slogged, which means that it is not possible for the glip to have not been slogged.\n\nTherefore, if we negate the statement \"It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged,\" we get \"The glip might not have been slogged.\" This means that it is possible for the glip to have not been slogged, which is the opposite of what the original statement implies.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
