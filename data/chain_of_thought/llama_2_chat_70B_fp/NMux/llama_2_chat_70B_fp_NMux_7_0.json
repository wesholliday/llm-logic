However, if we negate the second part of the statement, we get \"the whiffle might have been shanked,\" which implies that it is possible that the whiffle was shanked, but not necessarily.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The whiffle might not have been shanked\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
