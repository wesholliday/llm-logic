By negating this statement, we are essentially saying that it's not necessary or obligatory for the grommet to have been sploffed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that it's possible or permissible for the grommet not to have been sploffed. In other words, \"The grommet might not have been sploffed\" is a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
