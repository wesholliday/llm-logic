The second part is a conditional statement, where \"the dreb must have been vroombed\" is the consequence of the condition \"it's the case that.\"\n\nTherefore, the negation of the statement \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been vroombed\" would be \"It is the case that the dreb must have been vroombed.\" This implies that the dreb might have been vroombed, but it's not certain.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
