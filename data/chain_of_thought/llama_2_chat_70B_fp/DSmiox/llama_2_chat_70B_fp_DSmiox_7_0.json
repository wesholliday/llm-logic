Either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that the whiffle might not be tinked, which means that it is possible that the whiffle is not tinked.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that there are only two possibilities for the whiffle: it is either shanked or it must be tinked. Since we have already established that the whiffle might not be tinked, we can conclude that the only remaining possibility is that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
