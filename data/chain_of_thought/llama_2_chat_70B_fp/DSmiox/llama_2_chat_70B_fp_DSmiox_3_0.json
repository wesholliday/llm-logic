Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that the splat might not be quanked, which means that there is a possibility that it is not quanked.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that there are two possibilities: either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked. Since we have already established that the splat might not be quanked, it means that the only remaining possibility is that the splat is morphed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
