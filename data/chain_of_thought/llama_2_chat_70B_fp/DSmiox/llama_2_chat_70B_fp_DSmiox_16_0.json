Either the sneg is crampled or it must be sproted.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that the sneg might not be sproted, which means that it is possible that the sneg is not sproted.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that there are two possibilities: either the sneg is crampled or it must be sproted. Since we have already established that the sneg might not be sproted, it means that the only remaining possibility is that the sneg is crampled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
