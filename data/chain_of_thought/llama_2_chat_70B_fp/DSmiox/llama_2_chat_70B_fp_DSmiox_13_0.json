Either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that the glip might not be tragged, which means that it is possible that the glip is not tragged.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that there are only two possibilities for the glip: either it is slogged or it must be tragged. Since we have already established that the glip might not be tragged (premise 1), we can conclude that the only remaining possibility is that the glip is slogged.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
