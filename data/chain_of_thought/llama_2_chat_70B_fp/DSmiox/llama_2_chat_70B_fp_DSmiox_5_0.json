Either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that the zinger might not be smoogled, which means that there is a possibility that it is not smoogled.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that there are only two possibilities for the zinger: it is either fraggled or it must be smoogled. Since we have already established that the zinger might not be smoogled, it means that the only remaining possibility is that it is fraggled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
