Either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that the flob might not be movated, which means it's possible that the flob is not movated.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that if the flob is not skizzled, then it must be movated. However, since we've established that the flob might not be movated, it's possible that the flob is not skizzled.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can infer that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
