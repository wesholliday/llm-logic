Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked\n\nFrom the first premise, we can infer that the fribble might not be crinked, which means that the possibility of the fribble being crinked is not certain.\n\nFrom the second premise, we have a disjunction of two possibilities:\n\n* The fribble is snurgled\n* The fribble must be crinked\n\nSince the first possibility is \"The fribble is snurgled\", and we know that the fribble might not be crinked, we can infer that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw from the two premises is:\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that the fribble is snurgled.",
