Either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that the smip might not be lupped, which means it's possible that the smip is not lupped.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that there are only two possibilities for the smip: either it's shripped or it must be lupped. Since we've already established that the smip might not be lupped, the only remaining possibility is that the smip is shripped.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
