Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that the flugel might not be zargled, which means it is possible that the flugel is not zargled.\n\nFrom premise 2, we can infer that the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled. Since we have already established that the flugel might not be zargled, it means that the flugel must be blimmed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
