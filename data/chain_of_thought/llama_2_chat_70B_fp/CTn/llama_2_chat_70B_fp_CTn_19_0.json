The converse of the statement would be \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nHowever, we cannot infer the converse of the statement directly from the given statement. The given statement only tells us that Tom watching football implies Jen did not watch basketball, but it does not provide any information about the relationship between Jen watching basketball and Tom watching football.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football\" directly from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
