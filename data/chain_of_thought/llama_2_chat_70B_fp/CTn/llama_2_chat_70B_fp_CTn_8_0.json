It expresses a relationship between two events, where the occurrence of one event (the vampire being awake) implies the non-occurrence of the other event (the mummy being awake).\n\nTo infer the converse of this statement, we need to switch the order of the events. The converse of \"If A then B\" is \"If B then A\". In this case, we have \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was not awake\", so the converse would be \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake\".\n\nTherefore, the converse of the given statement is \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
