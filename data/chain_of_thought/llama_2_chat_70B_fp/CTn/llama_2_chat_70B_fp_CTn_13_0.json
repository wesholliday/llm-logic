            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was not blue\" is a conditional statement. It implies that the color of the car and the truck are related, such that if the car is red, then the truck cannot be blue.\n\nTo infer \"If the truck was blue, then the car was not red\" from the given statement, we need to use the contrapositive form of the conditional statement. The contrapositive of a statement is obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion, and negating both parts. In this case, the hypothesis is \"the truck was blue\" and the conclusion is \"the car was not red\".\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of the given statement is \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was red\". This means that if the truck is not blue, then it is possible that the car is red.\n\nNow, let's negate both parts of the contrapositive statement to get the desired statement: \"If the truck was blue, then the car was not red\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
