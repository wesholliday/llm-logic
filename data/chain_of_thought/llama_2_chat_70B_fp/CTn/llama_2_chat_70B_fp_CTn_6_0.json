It implies that the choice of pizza by Sue is sufficient to conclude that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nTo infer the converse of this statement, we need to switch the roles of Sue and Bob in the statement. The converse statement would be \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\nHowever, we cannot infer the converse statement directly from the given statement. The given statement only tells us that Sue's choice of pizza is related to Bob's non-choice of pasta, but it does not provide any information about Bob's choice of pasta in relation to Sue's choice of pizza.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\" from the given statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
