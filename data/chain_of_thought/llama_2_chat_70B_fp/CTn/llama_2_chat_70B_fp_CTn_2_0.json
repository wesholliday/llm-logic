            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest\" is a conditional statement. It implies that the presence of the griffin in the forest implies the absence of the unicorn in the forest.\n\nTo infer the converse statement \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest,\" we need to use the concept of contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement is obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement. In this case, the hypothesis is \"the unicorn was in the forest\" and the conclusion is \"the griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nTherefore, to infer the converse statement, we need to negate the original statement and then switch the hypothesis and conclusion. The negation of the original statement is \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" Now, we switch the hypothesis and conclusion to get the converse statement: \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
