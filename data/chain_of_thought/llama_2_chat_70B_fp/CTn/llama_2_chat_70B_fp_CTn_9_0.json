            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement. It implies that the purchase of the red shirt by Lisa is sufficient to conclude that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nTo infer the converse of this statement, we need to switch the roles of Lisa and Mark in the premise. In other words, we need to assume that Mark bought the blue shirt and see if we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nIf Mark bought the blue shirt, then by the same logic, Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is because the premise \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" implies that the purchase of the red shirt by Lisa is sufficient to conclude that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. Therefore, if Mark bought the blue shirt, it means that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
