It implies that the taking of a plane by Sam is sufficient to conclude that Erin did not take a train.\n\nTo infer the converse of this statement, we need to switch the roles of Sam and Erin. The converse statement would be \"If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\nHowever, we cannot infer the converse statement directly from the given statement. The given statement only tells us that Sam's action (taking a plane) implies Erin's non-action (not taking a train), but it does not provide any information about Erin's action (taking a train) implying Sam's non-action (not taking a plane).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane\" directly from \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
