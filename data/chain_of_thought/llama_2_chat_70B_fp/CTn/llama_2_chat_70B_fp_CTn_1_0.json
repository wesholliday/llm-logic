            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then not B.\" To infer the converse of this statement, we need to switch the positions of A and B and negate the latter. In this case, A is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and B is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nSo, the converse of the statement would be \"If Sue was at the wedding, then not Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nHowever, this converse statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The original statement implies that Mary's presence at the wedding excludes Sue's presence, but the converse statement does not necessarily imply that Sue's presence excludes Mary's presence. In other words, it's possible that both Mary and Sue were at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No.",
