It implies that the shirt being cotton is sufficient to conclude that the pants are not denim.\n\nTo infer the converse of this statement, we need to switch the positions of the two parts of the statement. The converse of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nTherefore, to infer the converse of the given statement, we can rewrite it as:\n\n\"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nThis is the converse of the original statement, and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
