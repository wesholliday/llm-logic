It implies that the doll being plastic is sufficient to conclude that the truck was not metal.\n\nTo infer the converse of this statement, we need to switch the positions of the two parts of the statement. The converse of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nIn this case, we can rewrite the statement as \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic.\" This is the converse of the original statement, and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
