That is, we can rewrite the statement as \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside.\"\n\nThis revised statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, as the negation of the cat being outside (i.e., the cat being inside) implies the negation of the dog being inside (i.e., the dog being outside).\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
