It implies that the occurrence of one event (Ben eating pasta) implies the non-occurrence of the other event (Kate eating the salad).\n\nTo infer the converse of this statement, we need to switch the roles of the two events. In other words, we need to assume that the non-occurrence of one event (Kate not eating the salad) implies the occurrence of the other event (Ben eating pasta).\n\nHowever, this inference would not be valid. Just because Kate did not eat the salad, it does not mean that Ben ate pasta. There could be other reasons why Kate did not eat the salad, such as she didn't like it or she was full from eating something else.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Kate ate the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
