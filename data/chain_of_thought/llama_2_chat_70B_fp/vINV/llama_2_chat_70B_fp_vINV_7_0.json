In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. Alex finishes the race: In this scenario, the premise is true, and the conclusion is also true, since Chris finished the race along with Alex.\n2. Alex does not finish the race: In this scenario, the premise is false, and the conclusion is also false, since Chris did not finish the race along with Alex.\n\nIn both scenarios, the conclusion logically follows from the premise. Therefore, this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
