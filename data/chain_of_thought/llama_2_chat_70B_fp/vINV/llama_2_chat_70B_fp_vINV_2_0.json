            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the premise being \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" and the conclusion being \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest\". In order to determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to assess whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the contrapositive of the premise: The contrapositive of \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" is \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\".\n2. Negate the conclusion: The conclusion is \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest\". To negate this, we simply reverse the order of the clauses: \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\".\n3. Check if the negated conclusion is equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise: As we can see, the negated conclusion \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\" is indeed equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\".\n\nTherefore, since the negated conclusion is equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
