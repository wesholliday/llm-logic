In order to determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to assess whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nLet's break down the premise and conclusion into their component parts:\n\nPremise: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\"\n\n* If Jeff played basketball (antecedent), then Amy played tennis (consequent)\n\nConclusion: \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis\"\n\n* If Jeff did not play basketball (antecedent), then Amy did not play tennis (consequent)\n\nIn order for this argument to be logically valid, the conclusion must logically follow from the premise. In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. Jeff played basketball: In this case, the premise is true, and the conclusion is also true because Amy played tennis.\n2. Jeff did not play basketball: In this case, the premise is false, and the conclusion is also false because Amy did not play tennis.\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premise in both scenarios, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
