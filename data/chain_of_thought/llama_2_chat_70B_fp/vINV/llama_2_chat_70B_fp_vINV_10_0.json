            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the premise being \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" and the conclusion being \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside\". In order to determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the contrapositive of the premise: The contrapositive of \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" is \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside\".\n2. Negate the conclusion: The conclusion is \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside\". To negate this, we need to switch the order of the clauses, so the negated conclusion becomes \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside\".\n3. Check if the negated conclusion is equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise: As we can see, the negated conclusion \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside\" is indeed equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside\".\n\nTherefore, since the negated conclusion is equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
