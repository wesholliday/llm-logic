            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the premise being \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" and the conclusion being \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal\". In order to determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to assess whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the contrapositive of the premise: The contrapositive of \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\".\n2. Negate the conclusion: The conclusion is \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal\". To negate this, we simply reverse the order of the clauses: \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\".\n3. Check if the negated conclusion is equivalent to the contrapositive: As we can see, the negated conclusion \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\" is indeed equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\".\n\nTherefore, since the negated conclusion is equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
