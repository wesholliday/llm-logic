            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis argument is a conditional argument, with the premise being a conditional statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" and the conclusion being the negation of the premise \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel\".\n\nIn order to determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nLet's break down the premise:\n\n* \"If the book was written by James\" - This part of the premise asserts that the book was written by James.\n* \"then the book is a mystery novel\" - This part of the premise asserts that the book is a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's break down the conclusion:\n\n* \"If the book was not written by James\" - This part of the conclusion asserts that the book was not written by James.\n* \"then the book is not a mystery novel\" - This part of the conclusion asserts that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nIn order for the conclusion to logically follow from the premise, we need to be able to deduce the conclusion from the premise. In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nSo, let's assume that the premise is true. If the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. Now, if the book was not written by James, then it cannot be a mystery novel. This is because the premise asserts that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel, and if it was not written by James, then it cannot be a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, we can deduce the conclusion from the premise, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
