            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the premise being \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and the conclusion being \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\" In order to determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to assess whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the contrapositive of the premise: The contrapositive of \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n2. Negate the conclusion: The conclusion is \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\" Negating this statement gives us \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n3. Check if the negated conclusion is equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise: As we can see, the negated conclusion \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is indeed equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nTherefore, since the negated conclusion is equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
