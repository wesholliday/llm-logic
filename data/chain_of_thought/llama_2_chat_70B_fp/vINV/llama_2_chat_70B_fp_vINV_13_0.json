            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the premise being \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and the conclusion being \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\". In order to determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to assess whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nLet's break down the premise and conclusion into their component parts:\n\nPremise: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\"\n\n* If the car was red (R), then the truck was blue (B)\n\nConclusion: \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\"\n\n* If the car was not red (not-R), then the truck was not blue (not-B)\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Assume the premise is true (R \u2192 B)\n2. Negate the premise (not-R \u2192 not-B)\n3. Logically deduce the conclusion (not-R \u2192 not-B)\n\nIf we can logically deduce the conclusion from the premise, then the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
