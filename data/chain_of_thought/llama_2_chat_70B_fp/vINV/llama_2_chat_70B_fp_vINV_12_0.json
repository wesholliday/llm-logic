            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the premise being \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" and the conclusion being \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\". In order to determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to assess whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the contrapositive of the premise: The contrapositive of \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\".\n2. Negate the premise: Negating the premise gives us \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\". This is the same as the conclusion, so we can see that the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n3. Check for logical fallacies: There are no logical fallacies present in the argument, such as affirming the consequent or denying the antecedent.\n\nTherefore, based on these steps, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
