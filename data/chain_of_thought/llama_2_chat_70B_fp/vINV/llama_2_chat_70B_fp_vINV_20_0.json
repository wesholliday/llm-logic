            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the premise being \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and the conclusion being \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\". In order to determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the conditional statement in the premise: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\"\n2. Negate the premise: \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\"\n3. Determine whether the negated premise logically implies the conclusion:\n\nIn this case, the negated premise \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\" does logically imply the conclusion \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\". This is because if the apple was not red, then it cannot be the case that the banana was yellow, since the premise states that the banana is yellow only if the apple is red.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, since the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
