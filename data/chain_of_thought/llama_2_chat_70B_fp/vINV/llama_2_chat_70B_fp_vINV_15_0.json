            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the premise being \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" and the conclusion being \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train\". In order to determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to assess whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the contrapositive of the premise: The contrapositive of \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane\".\n2. Negate the premise: Negating the premise gives us \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train\".\n3. Show that the negated premise logically implies the conclusion: If we assume that Sam did not take a plane, then by the contrapositive of the premise, Erin did not take a train. Therefore, the negated premise logically implies the conclusion.\n\nSince we have shown that the negated premise logically implies the conclusion, we can conclude that the original argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
