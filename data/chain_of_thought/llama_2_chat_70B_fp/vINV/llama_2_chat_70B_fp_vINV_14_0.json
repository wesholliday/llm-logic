            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to evaluate its structure and see if it follows a valid logical pattern. The argument has the form:\n\nIf A, then B\nNot A\nTherefore, not B\n\nWhere A is \"the bear was in the cave\" and B is \"the wolf was in the den\".\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus tollens, which is a valid logical form. Modus tollens consists of three parts:\n\n1. If A, then B\n2. Not A\n3. Therefore, not B\n\nThe first premise establishes a conditional relationship between A and B, stating that if A is true, then B must also be true. The second premise negates A, and the conclusion logically follows from the first two premises.\n\nIn this case, the argument is logically valid because if the bear was not in the cave, it is reasonable to conclude that the wolf was not in the den, given the conditional relationship established in the first premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
