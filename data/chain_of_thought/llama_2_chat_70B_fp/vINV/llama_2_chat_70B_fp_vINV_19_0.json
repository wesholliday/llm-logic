            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the premise being \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" and the conclusion being \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball\". In order to determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to assess whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the contrapositive of the premise: The contrapositive of \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\".\n2. Negate the conclusion: The conclusion is \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball\". To negate this, we simply reverse the order of the clauses: \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\".\n3. Check if the negated conclusion is equivalent to the contrapositive: As we can see, the negated conclusion \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\" is indeed equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\".\n\nTherefore, since the negated conclusion is equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
