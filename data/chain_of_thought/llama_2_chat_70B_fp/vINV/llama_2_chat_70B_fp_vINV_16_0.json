            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the premise being \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" and the conclusion being \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim\". In order to determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to assess whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the contrapositive of the premise: The contrapositive of \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\".\n2. Negate the premise: Negating the premise gives us \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were denim\".\n3. Negate the conclusion: Negating the conclusion gives us \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton\".\n4. Check for logical equivalence: We can see that the negated conclusion and the contrapositive of the premise are logically equivalent, as they both express the same idea - that the pants being denim implies the shirt being cotton.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid, as the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
