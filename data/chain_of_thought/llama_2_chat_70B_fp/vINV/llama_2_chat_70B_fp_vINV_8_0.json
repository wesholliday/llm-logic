            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the premise being \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" and the conclusion being \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\" In order to determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to assess whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the contrapositive of the premise: The contrapositive of \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\"\n2. Negate the conclusion: The conclusion is \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\" Negating this gives us \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n3. Check if the negated conclusion is equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise: As we can see, the negated conclusion \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was awake\" is indeed equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\"\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, as the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
