            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional argument, with the premise being \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" and the conclusion being \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt\". In order to determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to assess whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the contrapositive of the premise: The contrapositive of \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\".\n2. Negate the conclusion: The conclusion is \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt\". To negate this, we simply reverse the order of the clauses: \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\".\n3. Check if the negated conclusion is equivalent to the contrapositive: As we can see, the negated conclusion \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" is indeed equivalent to the contrapositive \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\".\n\nTherefore, since the negated conclusion is equivalent to the contrapositive, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
