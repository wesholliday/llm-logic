In order to determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to assess whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the contrapositive of the premise: The contrapositive of \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\".\n2. Negate the premise: Negating the premise gives us \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\".\n3. Show that the negated premise logically implies the conclusion: If the premise is \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\", and we negate the premise to get \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\", then we can see that the conclusion logically follows.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
