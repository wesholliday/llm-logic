The remote control is on the coffee table.\nThis possibility is consistent with the second statement, as the remote control isn't under the couch.\n2. The remote control is hiding somewhere else.\nThis possibility is inconsistent with the first statement, as it implies that the remote control is not in either of the two mentioned locations.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
