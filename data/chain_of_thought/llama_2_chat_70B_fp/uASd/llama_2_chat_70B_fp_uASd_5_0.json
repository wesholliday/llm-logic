In this case, the payment has still been made, but the check has not been successfully processed.\n\nIf we apply the principle of non-contradiction, we can infer that the services will continue because the bill has been paid, even though the check has bounced. This is because the original statement only specifies that the bill must be paid, not that the payment must be successful.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the bill is paid and the check bounces, then the services will continue.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
