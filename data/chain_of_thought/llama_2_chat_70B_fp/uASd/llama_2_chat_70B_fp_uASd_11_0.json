In other words, if you meet the condition of getting enough sleep, you will not experience tiredness.\n\nHowever, the statement does not imply that hard labor will not make you tired. In fact, hard labor is likely to make you tired regardless of whether you have had enough sleep or not. Therefore, we cannot infer that if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired.\n\nAnswer: No",
