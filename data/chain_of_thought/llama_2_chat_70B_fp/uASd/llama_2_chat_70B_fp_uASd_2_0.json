It suggests that the concert is a sufficient condition for having a good time.\n\nHowever, if we add the additional information \"and a bomb goes off,\" it significantly changes the situation. The bomb going off would likely cause harm, destruction, and chaos, which would not be conducive to having a good time. In fact, it would likely lead to the opposite - a bad time.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time. The presence of a bomb and the potential harm it could cause would override the positive impact of the concert, making it unlikely that we would have a good time.\n\nAnswer: No.",
