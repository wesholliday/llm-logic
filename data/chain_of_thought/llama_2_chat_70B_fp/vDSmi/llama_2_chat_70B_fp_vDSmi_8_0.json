            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a form of disjunctive syllogism, which has the following form:\n\nEither P or Q\nNot Q\nTherefore, P\n\nIn this case, the premises are:\n\nEither the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch (P)\nThe remote control might not be hiding under the couch (not Q)\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\nThe remote control is on the coffee table (P)\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, we need to see if it is impossible for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true.\n\nAssuming that the premises are true, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. The remote control is on the coffee table: In this case, the conclusion is true, and the argument is valid.\n2. The remote control is hiding under the couch: In this case, the second premise is false, and the conclusion is still true. However, this scenario is impossible since we've assumed that the second premise is true.\n3. The remote control is neither on the coffee table nor hiding under the couch: In this case, both premises are false, which means that the conclusion is also false. However, this scenario is impossible since we've assumed that the first premise is true.\n\nSince we've shown that the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and that it is impossible for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
