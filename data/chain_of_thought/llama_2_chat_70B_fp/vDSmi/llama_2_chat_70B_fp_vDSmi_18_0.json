In other words, we need to see if it is impossible for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true.\n\nIf the first premise is true, then the notebook is either in the drawer or on the nightstand. If the second premise is true, then the notebook is not on the nightstand. Therefore, if both premises are true, the only possibility is that the notebook is in the drawer, which means the conclusion is true.\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
