The first premise states that either P or Q must be true. The second premise states that Q is not true. Therefore, the conclusion is that P must be true, i.e. the scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it follows the correct form of a disjunctive syllogism. If the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In this case, if the first premise is true and the second premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
