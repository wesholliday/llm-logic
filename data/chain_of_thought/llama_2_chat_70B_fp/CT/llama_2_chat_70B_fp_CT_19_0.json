The converse of \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" would be \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football.\"\n\nNow, we can negate this converse statement to get the desired statement: \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
