            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement, \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" It implies that the presence of the griffin in the forest guarantees the presence of the unicorn in the forest.\n\nTo infer the converse of this statement, we need to switch the positions of the two parts of the statement. The converse of \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" would be \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nThis converse statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin cannot be in the forest either, since the presence of the griffin in the forest would imply the presence of the unicorn in the forest, which we have assumed not to be the case.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
