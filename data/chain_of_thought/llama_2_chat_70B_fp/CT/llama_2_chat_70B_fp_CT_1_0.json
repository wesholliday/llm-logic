            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement, and it can be represented as:\n\nIf Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\n\nWe can rewrite this statement in the form of a truth table:\n\n| Mary at wedding | Sue at wedding |\n| --- | --- |\n| True | True |\n| False | False |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that the statement is true only when both Mary and Sue are at the wedding. Now, let's consider the inverse of the statement:\n\nIf Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\n\nWe can represent this statement as:\n\n~Sue at wedding \u2192 ~Mary at wedding\n\nUsing the truth table, we can see that this statement is not true. In the second row of the table, Sue is not at the wedding, but Mary is still at the wedding, so the statement is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
