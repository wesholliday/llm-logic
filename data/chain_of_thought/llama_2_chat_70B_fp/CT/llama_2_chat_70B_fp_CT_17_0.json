The converse of \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\" would be \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\".\n\nHowever, we cannot infer the converse directly from the given statement. The given statement only tells us that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad, but it does not provide any information about the case where Kate did not eat the salad.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\" directly from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
