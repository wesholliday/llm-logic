            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is a conditional statement. It implies that the vampire's awakeness is sufficient to guarantee the mummy's awakeness. In other words, if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must be awake.\n\nTo infer the converse of this statement, we need to switch the order of the premises. The converse of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\"\n\nTherefore, to infer \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake,\" we need to negate the original statement. We can do this by changing \"was awake\" to \"was not awake\" and \"then\" to \"then not.\"\n\nSo, the converse of the given statement would be:\n\n\"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
