It implies that the choice of pizza by Sue is sufficient to conclude that Bob chose pasta.\n\nTo infer the converse of this statement, we need to switch the roles of Sue and Bob in the condition. In other words, we can rewrite the statement as \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\nThis revised statement is the converse of the original statement, and it is logically equivalent. Therefore, we can infer \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
