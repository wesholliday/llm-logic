            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement, \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" It implies that Joe's going to the park is the sufficient condition for Lucy to go to the zoo. In other words, if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy would not have gone to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's consider the inverse of the statement: \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\" This statement implies that Lucy's not going to the zoo is the sufficient condition for Joe not to go to the park.\n\nHowever, we cannot infer the inverse statement from the given statement because the relationship between Joe and Lucy's actions is not transitive. In other words, just because Joe's going to the park implies Lucy's going to the zoo, it does not mean that Lucy's not going to the zoo implies Joe's not going to the park. There could be other factors that affect Joe's decision to go to the park, such as his personal preferences or other obligations.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the inverse statement from the given statement, and the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: No.",
