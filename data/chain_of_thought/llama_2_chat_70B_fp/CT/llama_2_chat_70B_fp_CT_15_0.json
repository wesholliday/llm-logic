It implies that the occurrence of one event (Sam taking a plane) necessarily leads to the occurrence of the other event (Erin taking a train).\n\nTo infer the converse of this statement, we need to switch the order of the events and negate the conclusion. In other words, we need to start with the negation of the conclusion and work backward to the premise.\n\nSo, let's start with the negation of the conclusion: \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\nTo determine whether this statement is true, we need to examine the given statement and see if it supports the negation.\n\nIf Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n\nIf we negate the premise, we get:\n\nIf Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\n\nThis negated premise supports the negation of the conclusion: \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer the converse of the given statement, which is:\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
