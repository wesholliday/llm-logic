The converse of \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" would be \"If the truck was blue, then the car was red.\"\n\nHowever, we cannot infer the converse directly from the given statement. The given statement only tells us that when the car is red, the truck is blue, but it doesn't tell us anything about the relationship between the truck's color and the car's color when the truck is not blue.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\" directly from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
