It suggests that Jeff playing basketball leads to Amy playing tennis.\n\nTherefore, if we negate the consequent (B), we get \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis,\" which is the converse of the original statement.\n\nSo, we can infer the converse of the statement, and the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
