It implies that the shirt being cotton is sufficient to conclude that the pants are denim.\n\nTo infer the converse of this statement, we need to switch the order of the premises. The converse of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nTherefore, to infer \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton,\" we need to negate the premise \"the pants were denim\" and keep the conclusion \"the shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nSo, the converse of the given statement is:\n\n\"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
