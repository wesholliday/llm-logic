The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nTo derive the contrapositive, we can start with the original statement and negate both sides:\n\n\"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\"\n\nNegating the statement gives us:\n\n\"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\"\n\nNow, we can interchange the positions of the two parts of the statement to get the contrapositive:\n\n\"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\"\n\nTherefore, the converse of the given statement is \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
