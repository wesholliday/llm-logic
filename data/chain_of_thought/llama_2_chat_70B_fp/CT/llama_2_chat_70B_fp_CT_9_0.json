In this case, it appears that A (Lisa buying the red shirt) is the sufficient condition for B (Mark buying the blue shirt) to occur. In other words, if A happens, then B must happen.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the converse of the statement, which is:\n\nIf Mark did not buy the blue shirt (not-B), then Lisa did not buy the red shirt (not-A).\n\nThis converse statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the converse statement must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
