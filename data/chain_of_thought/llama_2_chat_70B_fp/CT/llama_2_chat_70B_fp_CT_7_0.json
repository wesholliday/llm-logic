The converse statement would be, \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\nHowever, we cannot infer the converse statement from the given statement alone. The given statement only tells us that if Alex finished the race, then Chris also finished the race, but it does not provide any information about the possibility of Chris not finishing the race.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the converse statement, \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race,\" from the given statement, \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
