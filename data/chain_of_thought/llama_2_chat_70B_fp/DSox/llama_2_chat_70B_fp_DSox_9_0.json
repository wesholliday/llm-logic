Since it's not plinked either, it means that the statement \"Either the twonk is varnished or it is plinked\" is false.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that the statement \"The twonk is not plinked\" alone does not allow us to infer \"The twonk is varnished\". We need the additional information provided in the second statement to make that inference.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
