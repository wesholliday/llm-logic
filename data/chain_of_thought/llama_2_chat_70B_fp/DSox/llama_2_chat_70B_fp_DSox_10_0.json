Either the wug is sproinged or it is garpled\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that the wug is not garpled.\n\nFrom the second premise, we have two possibilities:\n\na. The wug is sproinged\nb. The wug is garpled\n\nSince we know that the wug is not garpled (from the first premise), we can eliminate option b. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is a. The wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
