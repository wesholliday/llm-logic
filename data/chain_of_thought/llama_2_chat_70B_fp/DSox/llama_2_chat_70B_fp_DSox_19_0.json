Either the smonk is vreebled or it is plagged.\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that the smonk is not plagged. Now, let's consider the second premise. It states that there are two possibilities: either the smonk is vreebled or it is plagged. Since we know that the smonk is not plagged, the only remaining possibility is that it is vreebled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
