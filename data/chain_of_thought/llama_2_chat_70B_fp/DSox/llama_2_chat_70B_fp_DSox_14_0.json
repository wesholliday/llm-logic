Either the clug is fleeked or it is snugged\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that the clug is not snugged.\n\nFrom the second premise, we have two possibilities:\n\n* The clug is fleeked\n* The clug is snugged\n\nSince we know that the clug is not snugged (from the first premise), we can eliminate the second possibility, and therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
