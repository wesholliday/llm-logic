Additionally, the sneg being crampled means that it cannot be sproted, which aligns with the second statement.\n\nScenario 2: The sneg is not crampled\nIn this scenario, the sneg is not sproted, which aligns with the first statement. However, if the sneg is not crampled, then it could be sproted, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
