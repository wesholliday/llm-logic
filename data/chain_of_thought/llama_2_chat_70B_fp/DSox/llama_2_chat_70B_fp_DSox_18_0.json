Either the shank is plooked or it is nugged.\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that the shank is not nugged. Now, let's consider the second premise. It states that there are only two possibilities for the shank: either it is plooked or it is nugged. Since we know that the shank is not nugged, the only remaining possibility is that it is plooked.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
