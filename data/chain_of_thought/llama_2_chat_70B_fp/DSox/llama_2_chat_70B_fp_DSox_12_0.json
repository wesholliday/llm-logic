Either the smip is shripped or it is lupped.\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that the smip is not lupped. Now, let's consider the second premise. It states that the smip can be either shripped or lupped, but since it's not lupped, the only remaining option is that it's shripped.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
