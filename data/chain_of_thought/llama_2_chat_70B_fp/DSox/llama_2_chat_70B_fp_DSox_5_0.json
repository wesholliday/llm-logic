Either the zinger is fraggled or it is smoogled\n\nFrom 1, we know that the zinger is not smoogled.\n\nFrom 2, we know that there are only two possibilities for the zinger: it is either fraggled or smoogled. Since we know that it is not smoogled (from 1), the only remaining possibility is that it is fraggled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
