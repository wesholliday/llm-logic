            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a type of modus tollens argument, which has the following form:\n\nPremise: If A, then B\nConclusion: Not B, therefore not A\n\nIn this case, the premise is \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\" (If A), and the conclusion is \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" (Not B).\n\nThe validity of this argument depends on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In other words, is it necessarily true that if Lisa might not have bought the red shirt, then it's not the case that she must have bought it?\n\nTo determine this, let's consider the possible ways the premise could be true:\n\n1. Lisa did not buy the red shirt. In this case, the conclusion would also be true, since if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then it's not the case that she must have bought it.\n2. Lisa did buy the red shirt, but she might not have. In this case, the conclusion would still be true, since even if Lisa did buy the red shirt, the fact that she might not have means that it's not necessarily the case that she must have bought it.\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premise in both possible ways, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
