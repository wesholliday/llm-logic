In this case, the premise is \"The shoes might not be in the closet,\" which means that the possibility that the shoes are not in the closet is being considered. If this premise is true, then it is not necessarily the case that the shoes must be in the closet. Therefore, the conclusion \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet\" logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
