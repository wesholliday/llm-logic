In this case, the premise is \"Sue might not have chosen pizza,\" which means that it's possible that Sue did not choose pizza. If it's possible that Sue did not choose pizza, then it's not necessary that Sue chose pizza. In other words, the possibility that Sue did not choose pizza undermines the necessity of Sue choosing pizza. Therefore, the conclusion \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
