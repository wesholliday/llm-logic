It could be somewhere else or not hidden at all.\n2. \"Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table\" - This is a disjunctive statement, meaning that one of the two clauses must be true. The first clause is \"the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" which we know is not necessarily true based on the first piece of information. Therefore, the second clause \"it is on the coffee table\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
