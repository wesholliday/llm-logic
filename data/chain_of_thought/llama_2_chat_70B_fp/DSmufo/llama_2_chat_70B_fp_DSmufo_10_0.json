If the missing sock is not under the bed, then it must be in the laundry basket. This can be represented logically as:\n\n\u00ac(The missing sock must be under the bed) \u2228 (The missing sock is in the laundry basket)\n\nSimplifying the expression using De Morgan's laws and the distributive property, we get:\n\n\u00ac(The missing sock must be under the bed) \u2228 (The missing sock is in the laundry basket)\n\n\u00ac(The missing sock must be under the bed) \u2228 \u00ac(The missing sock is not in the laundry basket)\n\n\u00ac(The missing sock must be under the bed) \u2228 \u00ac(The missing sock is in the laundry basket)\n\nSince the first premise states that the missing sock is not under the bed, we can deduce that the missing sock must be in the laundry basket. Therefore, the conclusion is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
