In this case, the first statement is false, but the second statement is still true because the cat is not napping on the couch.\nScenario 2: The cat is napping on the couch. In this case, both statements are true: the cat is not playing in the bedroom, and it's napping on the couch.\n\nSince we know that the first statement is false, we can conclude that the cat is not playing in the bedroom. Therefore, the only possible scenario is Scenario 2, where the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
