If the toy is not on the bookshelf, then it must be in the toy box, as per the second statement.\n2. If the toy is on the bookshelf, then it cannot be in the toy box, as per the second statement.\n\nIn either case, we can conclude that the toy is not on the bookshelf. Therefore, the only possible location for the toy is the toy box.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
