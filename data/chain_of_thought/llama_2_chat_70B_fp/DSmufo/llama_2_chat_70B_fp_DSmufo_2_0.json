In this case, the first statement is false, but the second statement is still true because the book is indeed resting on the table.\nScenario 2: The book is not resting on the table. In this case, the first statement is true, and the second statement is also true because the book is either on the table (which we've established it's not) or it's on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the book must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
