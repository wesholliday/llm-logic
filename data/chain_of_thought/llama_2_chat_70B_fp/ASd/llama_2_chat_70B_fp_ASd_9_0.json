            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe original statement is a conditional statement, \"If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A.\" This statement implies that if the essay meets certain criteria (i.e., it is well-written), then a certain outcome will occur (i.e., the student will get an A).\n\nThe question is asking us to infer whether the following statement can be logically deduced from the original statement: \"If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A.\"\n\nTo determine whether this inference is valid, we need to consider whether the additional condition of \"turned in late\" affects the outcome of the student getting an A.\n\nIf the essay is well-written, it is still possible for the student to get an A even if it is turned in late. However, it is also possible for the student to receive a lower grade or even fail the assignment if it is turned in late, regardless of its quality.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce that \"If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
