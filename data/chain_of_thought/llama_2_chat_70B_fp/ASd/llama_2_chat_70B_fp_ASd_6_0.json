However, this does not necessarily mean that the scream will not still hurt their ears.\n\nEarplugs can help to reduce the volume of a loud noise, but they do not completely block out sound. If the scream is loud enough, it may still be able to penetrate the earplugs and cause discomfort or pain to the speaker's ears.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it is reasonable to infer that if the speaker is wearing earplugs and someone screams, it may still hurt their ears.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
