In other words, if you meet the condition of getting enough sleep, you will not experience tiredness.\n\nHowever, the statement \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired\" adds an additional condition of doing hard labor. This means that even if you get enough sleep, you may still experience tiredness if you engage in hard labor.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the latter statement from the former statement because the additional condition of hard labor may override the effect of sleep on tiredness.\n\nAnswer: No",
