In other words, as long as the bill is paid, the services will continue, regardless of any other factors.\n\nNow, let's consider the modified statement \"If the bill is paid and the check bounces, then the services will continue.\" This statement adds a new condition, \"the check bounces,\" to the original statement. The question is whether this new condition affects the inference that can be made from the original statement.\n\nIn this case, the fact that the check bounces does not necessarily impact the payment of the bill. The bill can still be paid even if the check bounces, as the payment may have been made through other means, such as a credit card or electronic transfer. Therefore, the additional condition of the check bouncing does not change the fact that the bill has been paid, and the services should continue.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
