            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement, \"If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm.\" This statement implies that the oven being on is sufficient to make the kitchen warm.\n\nNow, let's consider the proposed inference, \"If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm.\" This statement includes an additional condition, \"the pilot light is out,\" which is not present in the original statement.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer the proposed statement from the given statement, we need to evaluate whether the additional condition affects the conclusion. In this case, the additional condition of the pilot light being out does not affect the conclusion of the kitchen being warm. The oven being on is still sufficient to make the kitchen warm, regardless of whether the pilot light is out or not.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm\" from \"If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
