In other words, if the package has been shipped, then it is guaranteed to arrive today.\n\nNow, let's consider the modified statement \"If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today.\" This statement adds a new condition, \"it was misrouted,\" to the original statement. The question is whether this new condition affects the conclusion that the package will arrive today.\n\nIn this case, the fact that the package was misrouted does not necessarily prevent it from arriving today. Misrouting might cause delays, but it does not necessarily mean that the package will not arrive at all. Therefore, we can still infer that if the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
