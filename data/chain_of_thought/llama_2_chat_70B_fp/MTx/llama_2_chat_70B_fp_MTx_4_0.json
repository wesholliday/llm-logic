If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked (premise)\n2. The fribble did not crink (premise)\n3. If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked (premise)\n4. The fribble did not crink (premise)\n5. Therefore, the fribble was not snurgled (conclusion)\n\nThe argument follows the pattern of modus tollens, where the premises are \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\" and \"The fribble did not crink.\" The conclusion is \"The fribble was not snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
