            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"The wug was not sproinged\" from the given premises, we need to evaluate the relationship between the concepts of sproinging and garpling.\n\nThe first premise states that if the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled. This means that sproinging implies garpling. In other words, if something is sproinged, then it must be garpled.\n\nThe second premise states that the wug was not garpled. This means that the wug did not have the property of being garpled.\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer that if the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged. This is because if the wug was sproinged, it would have been garpled, but it was not garpled, therefore it was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
