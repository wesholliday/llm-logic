To determine if the antecedent \"the grommet was sploffed\" can be inferred, we need to evaluate the argument using the rules of logic.\n\nThe contrapositive of the conditional statement is \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\" This is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nGiven the premise \"The grommet did not plop the frink,\" we can conclude the contrapositive \"The grommet was not sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
