To determine if we can infer \"The flob was not skizzled\", we need to evaluate the argument using the following steps:\n\n1. If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated (premise)\n2. The flob did not movated (premise)\n3. If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated (premise)\n4. The flob did not movated (premise)\n5. Therefore, the flob was not skizzled (conclusion)\n\nThe argument follows the pattern of modus tollens, where the premises are \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\" and \"The flob did not movated\". The conclusion is \"The flob was not skizzled\".\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
