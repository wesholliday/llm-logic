            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on a conditional statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" which means that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must be denim. The second premise is \"The pants were denim\" which means that the pants are indeed denim.\n\nUsing modus ponens, a logical rule of inference, we can conclude that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. Modus ponens states that if \"If A, then B\" and \"B\", then \"A\". In this case, A is \"the shirt was cotton\" and B is \"the pants were denim\".\n\nTherefore, using modus ponens, we can infer that since the pants were denim (B), it must mean that the shirt was cotton (A).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
