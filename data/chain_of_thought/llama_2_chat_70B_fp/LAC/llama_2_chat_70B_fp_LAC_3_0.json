            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information is in the form of a conditional statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" and a separate statement \"The book is a mystery novel\". To determine if we can logically infer \"The book was written by James\", we need to evaluate if the given information allows us to conclude that the book was indeed written by James.\n\nLet's break down the conditional statement:\n\n* If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (premise 1)\n* The book is a mystery novel (premise 2)\n\nWe can infer that if premise 1 is true, then premise 2 must also be true. In other words, if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement:\n\n* The book is a mystery novel (premise 2)\n\nThis statement confirms that the book is indeed a mystery novel. However, it doesn't directly imply that the book was written by James.\n\nTo logically infer \"The book was written by James\", we need to use modus ponens, which states that if premise 1 and premise 2 are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In this case, the conclusion is \"The book was written by James\".\n\nSo, we can logically infer \"The book was written by James\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
