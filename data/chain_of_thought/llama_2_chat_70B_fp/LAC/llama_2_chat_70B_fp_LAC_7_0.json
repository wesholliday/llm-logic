In this case, the conclusion is \"Alex finished the race\" and the premises are \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" and \"Chris finished the race\".\n\nWe can use modus ponens, a rule of inference, to deduce the conclusion. Modus ponens states that if we have two premises, \"If A then B\" and \"B\", we can conclude \"A\".\n\nIn this case, we have the first premise \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" which states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. The second premise \"Chris finished the race\" states that Chris finished the race.\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can deduce that if Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race, since we know that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nTherefore, the argument is valid, and we can logically infer \"Alex finished the race\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
