            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on a conditional statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\". The conditional statement implies that the doll being plastic is sufficient to conclude that the truck is metal.\n\nGiven the additional premise \"The truck was metal\", we can infer that the sufficient condition for the truck to be metal (i.e., the doll being plastic) is met. Therefore, we can logically conclude that the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
