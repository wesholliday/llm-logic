In this case, the conclusion is \"The cake was chocolate\" and the premises are \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" and \"The muffins were blueberry\".\n\nWe can use the following steps to evaluate the argument:\n\n1. Assume the truth of the premises.\n2. Deduce the conclusion from the premises.\n\nIf we assume the truth of the premises, we can deduce the conclusion as follows:\n\n1. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry (premise 1).\n2. The muffins were blueberry (premise 2).\n3. Therefore, the cake was chocolate (conclusion).\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
