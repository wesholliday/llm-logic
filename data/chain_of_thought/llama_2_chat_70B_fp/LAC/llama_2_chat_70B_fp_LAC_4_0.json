The robot visited Jupiter.\n\nWe need to determine if we can logically infer \"The alien visited Mars\" based on these premises.\n\nLet's break down the first premise:\n\n1. If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nThis premise implies that the alien's visit to Mars is sufficient to guarantee the robot's visit to Jupiter. In other words, if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise:\n\n2. The robot visited Jupiter.\n\nThis premise tells us that the robot did, in fact, visit Jupiter.\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can conclude that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In this case, the conclusion is \"The alien visited Mars.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can logically infer \"The alien visited Mars.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
