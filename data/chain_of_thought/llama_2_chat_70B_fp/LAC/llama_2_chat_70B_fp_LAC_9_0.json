            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given information is in the form of a conditional statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" and a separate statement \"Mark bought the blue shirt\".\n\nTo determine if we can logically infer \"Lisa bought the red shirt\", we need to evaluate the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe conditional statement implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. In other words, if the premise (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the conclusion (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\nSince we know that Mark bought the blue shirt (from the separate statement), we can infer that the premise (Lisa bought the red shirt) must also be true. In other words, if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can logically infer \"Lisa bought the red shirt\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
