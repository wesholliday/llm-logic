Sue was at the wedding.\n\nFrom the first premise, we can infer that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This means that Sue's presence at the wedding is a sufficient condition for Mary's presence at the wedding.\n\nFrom the second premise, we know that Sue was at the wedding. Therefore, we can use modus ponens to conclude that Mary was at the wedding, since Sue's presence at the wedding is a sufficient condition for Mary's presence.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
