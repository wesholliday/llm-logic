The wolf was in the den.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can deduce that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. However, we cannot infer the converse, that is, we cannot deduce that if the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the cave.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that the wolf was in the den. However, this does not provide enough information to infer the presence of the bear in the cave.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we cannot logically infer 'The bear was in the cave'.\n\nAnswer: No.",
