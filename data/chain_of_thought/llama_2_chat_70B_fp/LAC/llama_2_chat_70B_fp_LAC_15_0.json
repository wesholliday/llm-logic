To determine if we can logically infer \"Sam took a plane\", we need to evaluate the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe conditional statement implies that if Sam took a plane, then Erin taking a train is a consequence of that action. In other words, if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin would not have taken a train.\n\nGiven that Erin took a train, we can conclude that the condition in the conditional statement (\"Sam took a plane\") must be true. In other words, since Erin took a train, it means that Sam must have taken a plane.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can logically infer \"Sam took a plane\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
