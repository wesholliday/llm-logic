            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument is based on a conditional statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" and a premise \"The mummy was awake\". To determine whether we can logically infer \"The vampire was awake\", we need to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\nThe conditional statement implies that the vampire's state (awake or asleep) is dependent on the mummy's state. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake, as the conditional statement dictates.\n\nGiven that the mummy was awake, we can conclude that the vampire was also awake, as the conditional statement suggests. In other words, the truth of the premise \"The mummy was awake\" implies the truth of the conclusion \"The vampire was awake\".\n\nTherefore, the argument is valid, and we can logically infer \"The vampire was awake\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
