Specifically, it means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nThe statement \"Also, Mark bought the blue shirt\" provides additional information that Mark did indeed buy the blue shirt.\n\nUsing the first statement, we can infer that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.
