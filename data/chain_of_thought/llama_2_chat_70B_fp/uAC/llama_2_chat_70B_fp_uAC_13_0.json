            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement. It implies that the color of the truck is dependent on the color of the car. If the car is red, then the truck must be blue.\n\nThe second statement \"Also, the truck was blue\" is a separate statement that provides additional information. It does not affect the conditional statement.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the car was red, we need to evaluate the given statements.\n\n1. If the car was red, then the truck was blue (conditional statement)\n2. The truck was blue (additional information)\n\nWe can conclude that the car was red because the truck was blue, which matches the condition in the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that the car was red.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
