Specifically, if the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside, and vice versa.\n\nThe statement \"Also, the cat was outside\" provides additional information that the cat was indeed outside.\n\nUsing the first statement, we can infer that if the cat was outside, then the dog must have been inside. This is because the statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" establishes a causal relationship between the dog's location and the cat's location.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can conclude that the dog was indeed inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
