Erin took a train.\n\nFrom the first premise, we can infer that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. However, we cannot infer the converse, that is, we cannot assume that Erin took a train implies that Sam took a plane.\n\nThe second premise states that Erin took a train. This information does not provide any insight into whether Sam took a plane or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: No.",
