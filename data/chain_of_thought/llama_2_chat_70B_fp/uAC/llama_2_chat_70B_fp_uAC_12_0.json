Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nFrom the first premise, we can infer that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. However, we cannot infer the converse, that is, we cannot assume that Lucy went to the zoo implies that Joe went to the park.\n\nThe second premise simply states that Lucy went to the zoo. This does not provide any information about Joe's whereabouts.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that Joe went to the park.\n\nAnswer: No.",
