The book is a mystery novel.\n\nWe want to infer whether the book was written by James.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that if the book was written by James, then it's a mystery novel. This means that if the book is a mystery novel, it's possible that it was written by James.\n\nPremise 2 states that the book is a mystery novel. This means that the book satisfies the condition of premise 1, which allows us to conclude that it's possible that the book was written by James.\n\nHowever, we cannot definitively say that the book was written by James based on the given information. It's possible that another author wrote the book, even though it's a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the book was written by James.",
