            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement. It implies that the color of the apple (red) is sufficient to conclude that the banana is yellow. The statement \"Also, the banana was yellow\" provides additional information that the banana was indeed yellow.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the apple was red, we need to evaluate the validity of the conditional statement and see if the premises lead to a logical conclusion.\n\nThe conditional statement can be represented as:\n\nIf A (apple is red), then B (banana is yellow)\nB (banana is yellow)\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can infer that:\n\nIf A (apple is red) and B (banana is yellow), then A (apple is red)\n\nIn this case, we know that B (banana is yellow) is true. Therefore, we can conclude that A (apple is red) is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
