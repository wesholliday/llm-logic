In other words, if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake.\n\nThe statement \"Also, the mummy was awake\" provides additional information that the mummy was indeed awake.\n\nUsing the first statement, we can infer that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire must also be awake, since the mummy's awakeness implies the vampire's awakeness.\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements, we can conclude that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
