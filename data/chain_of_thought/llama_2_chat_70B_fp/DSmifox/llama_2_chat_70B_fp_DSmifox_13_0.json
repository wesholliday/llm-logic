In other words, there is a possibility that the glip is not tragged.\n\nThe second premise, \"Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged,\" presents two exclusive options for the glip's state: either it is tragged or it is slogged. Since we know that the glip might not be tragged (from the first premise), we can infer that it might be slogged.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can conclude that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
