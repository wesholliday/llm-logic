If the sprocket is daggled, then it satisfies the first premise \"The sprocket might not be daggled.\"\n2. If the sprocket is cranked, then it satisfies the second premise \"Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
