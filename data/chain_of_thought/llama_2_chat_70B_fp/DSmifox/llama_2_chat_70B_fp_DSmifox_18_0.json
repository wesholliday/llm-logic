Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that the shank might not be nugged, which means it is possible that the shank is not nugged.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that there are only two possibilities for the shank: either it must be nugged or it is plooked. Since we have already established that the shank might not be nugged, it means that the only remaining possibility is that the shank is plooked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
