The second premise, \"Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled,\" provides two exclusive options for the smonk's state: either it is plagged or it is vreebled.\n\nIf the smonk is not plagged, then it must be vreebled, according to the second premise. Therefore, if the smonk might not be plagged, it is possible that it is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
