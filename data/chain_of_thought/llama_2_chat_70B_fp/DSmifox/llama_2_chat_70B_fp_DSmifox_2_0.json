It could be bimmed, or it might not be bimmed.\n\nThe second premise, \"Either the wug must be bimmed or it is flooped,\" presents two exclusive options for the wug's state: either it must be bimmed, or it is flooped.\n\nIf we combine these two premises, we can conclude that if the wug is not bimmed, then it must be flooped. This is because, according to the second premise, the only alternative to being bimmed is being flooped.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the wug is flooped.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
