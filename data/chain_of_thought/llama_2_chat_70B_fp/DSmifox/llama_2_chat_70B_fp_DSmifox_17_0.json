Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled.\n\nFrom premise 1, we can infer that the flob might not be movated, but we cannot conclude that it is not movated.\n\nFrom premise 2, we can infer that if the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible cases:\n\n1. The flob is movated. In this case, premise 1 is false, and premise 2 is irrelevant.\n2. The flob is not movated. In this case, premise 1 is true, and premise 2 implies that the flob is skizzled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
