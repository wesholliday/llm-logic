            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a type of modus tollens argument, which has the following form:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"Alex finished the race\" and Q is \"Chris must have finished the race\". The first premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. The second premise states that it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race. The conclusion is that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, we need to see if it's impossible for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true.\n\nLet's assume that the first premise is true. If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. This means that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race either.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise. It states that it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race. This means that it's possible that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nIf we combine these two premises, we can see that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race, but it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race. This means that it's possible that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that Alex did not finish the race logically follows from the premises. The argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
