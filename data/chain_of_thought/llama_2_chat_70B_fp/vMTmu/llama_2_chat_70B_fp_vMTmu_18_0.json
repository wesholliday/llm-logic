            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a type of modus tollens argument, which has the following form:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck must have been metal\". The first premise is stating that if the doll was plastic, then it follows that the truck must have been metal. The second premise is stating that it's not the case that the truck must have been metal. The conclusion is that the doll was not plastic.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the premises and conclusion:\n\t* Premise 1: If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n\t* Premise 2: It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\n\t* Conclusion: The doll was not plastic.\n2. Check if the argument follows a valid logical form:\n\t* The argument follows the modus tollens form, which is a valid logical form.\n3. Check if the premises are true:\n\t* Premise 1 is a conditional statement, and its truth value depends on the truth value of its antecedent (the doll was plastic) and consequent (the truck must have been metal). If both the antecedent and consequent are true, then the conditional statement is true.\n\t* Premise 2 is a negation statement, and its truth value is determined by the truth value of the statement it negates. If the statement being negated is false, then the negation statement is true.\n4. Check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises:\n\t* If Premise 1 is true and Premise 2 is true, then the conclusion logically follows.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
