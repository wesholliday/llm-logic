            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a type of modus tollens argument, which has the following form:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana must have been yellow\". The first premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. The second premise states that it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow. The conclusion is that the apple was not red.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, we need to see if it's impossible for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true.\n\nLet's assume that the first premise is true. If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. This means that if the apple was red, then the banana must have had the property of being yellow.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise. It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow. This means that it's not necessary for the banana to have the property of being yellow. In other words, the banana could have been any color other than yellow.\n\nIf we combine these two premises, we can see that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow, but it's not necessary for the banana to have been yellow. This means that it's possible for the apple to have been red and the banana to have been a color other than yellow.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that the apple was not red follows logically from the premises. It's impossible for the apple to have been red if the banana could have been any color other than yellow.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
