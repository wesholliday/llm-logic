            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a modus tollens argument, which has the following form:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nNot Q.\nTherefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen must have watched basketball\". The first premise is stating that if Tom watched football, then it is necessary that Jen watched basketball. The second premise is stating that it is not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. The conclusion is that Tom did not watch football.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, we need to see if it is impossible for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true.\n\nLet's assume that the first premise is true. If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This means that if Tom did not watch football, Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise. It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. This means that it's possible that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nIf we combine these two premises, we can see that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball. This means that the conclusion, \"Tom did not watch football\", logically follows from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
