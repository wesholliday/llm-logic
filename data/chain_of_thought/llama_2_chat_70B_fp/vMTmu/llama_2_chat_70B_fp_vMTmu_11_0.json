            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a modus tollens argument, which has the following form:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins must have been blueberry\". The first premise states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry. The second premise states that it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry. The conclusion is that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, we need to see if it's impossible for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true.\n\nLet's assume that the first premise is true. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry. This means that if the cake was chocolate, then it's necessary that the muffins were blueberry.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise. It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry. This means that it's possible that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nIf the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry (according to the first premise). But it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry (according to the second premise). This means that it's not possible for the cake to have been chocolate, since the muffins cannot be blueberry if the cake is chocolate.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that the cake was not chocolate logically follows from the premises. It's impossible for the cake to have been chocolate, given the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
