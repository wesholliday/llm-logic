            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a type of modus tollens argument, which has the following form:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin must have taken a train\". The first premise states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. The second premise states that it's not the case that Erin must have taken a train. The conclusion is that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, we need to see if it's impossible for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true.\n\nLet's assume that the first premise is true. If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train, according to the first premise. However, the second premise states that it's not the case that Erin must have taken a train. This means that Erin did not take a train, which in turn means that Sam did not take a plane, since the first premise states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Sam did not take a plane\" logically follows from the premises. It's impossible for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
