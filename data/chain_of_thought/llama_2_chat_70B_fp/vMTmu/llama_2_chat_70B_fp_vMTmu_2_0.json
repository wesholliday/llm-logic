            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a type of modus tollens argument, which has the following form:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nNot Q.\nTherefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"the griffin was in the forest\" and Q is \"the unicorn must have been in the forest\". The first premise is stating that if the griffin was in the forest, then it logically follows that the unicorn must have been in the forest. The second premise is stating that it's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, must the conclusion also be true?\n\nIf we assume that the first premise is true, then we can deduce that if the griffin was in the forest, the unicorn must have been in the forest. However, the second premise states that it's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest. This means that the assumption that the griffin was in the forest leads to a logical contradiction, since we have concluded that the unicorn must have been in the forest, but we have also stated that it's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that the griffin was not in the forest logically follows from the premises. The argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
