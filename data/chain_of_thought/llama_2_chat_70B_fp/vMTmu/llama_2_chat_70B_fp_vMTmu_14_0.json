            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a modus tollens argument, which has the following form:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q is \"the wolf must have been in the den\".\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the bear was in the cave, then it is necessary that the wolf must have been in the den. The second premise is a negation of the consequent of the conditional statement, which means that it is not the case that the wolf must have been in the den.\n\nIf we accept the first premise and the second premise, we can logically conclude that the bear was not in the cave. This is because, if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den, but since it's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den, it means that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, as the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
