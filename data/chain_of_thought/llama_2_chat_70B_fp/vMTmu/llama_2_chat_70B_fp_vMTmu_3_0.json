Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book must be a mystery novel\".\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true. The second premise is a negation of the consequent (Q), which means that it asserts that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nIf we accept both premises, we can logically deduce the conclusion, which is that the book was not written by James. This is because if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel, but since it's not a mystery novel, it cannot have been written by James.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, as the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
