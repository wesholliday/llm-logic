            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a type of modus tollens argument, which has the following form:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants must have been denim\". The first premise is stating that if the shirt was cotton, then it must be the case that the pants were denim. The second premise is stating that it is not the case that the pants must have been denim. The conclusion is that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the premises and conclusion:\n\t* Premise 1: If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\n\t* Premise 2: It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\n\t* Conclusion: The shirt was not cotton.\n2. Determine the relationship between the premises and conclusion:\n\t* The conclusion follows logically from the premises if the premises are true.\n3. Evaluate the premises:\n\t* Premise 1 is a conditional statement. If the shirt was cotton, then it must be the case that the pants were denim. This premise is true if the condition is met.\n\t* Premise 2 is a negation statement. It's not the case that the pants must have been denim. This premise is true if the condition is not met.\n4. Evaluate the conclusion:\n\t* The conclusion logically follows from the premises. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim (premise 1). However, it's not the case that the pants must have been denim (premise 2), therefore the shirt was not cotton (conclusion).\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid.",
