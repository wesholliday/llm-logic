            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a modus tollens argument, which has the following form:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nNot Q.\nTherefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue must have been at the wedding\". The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. The second premise states that it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. The conclusion is that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, we need to see if it's impossible for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true.\n\nIf we assume that the first premise is true, then we know that if Mary was at the wedding, Sue must have been at the wedding. However, the second premise states that it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nIf Sue was not at the wedding, then it's impossible for Mary to have been at the wedding, since the first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. Therefore, the conclusion that Mary was not at the wedding logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
