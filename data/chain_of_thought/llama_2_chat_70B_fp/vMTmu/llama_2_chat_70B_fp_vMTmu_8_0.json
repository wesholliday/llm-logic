            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThis argument is a form of modus tollens, which has the following structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"the vampire was awake\" and Q is \"the mummy must have been awake\". The first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. The second premise states that it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake. The conclusion is that the vampire was not awake.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, we need to see if it's impossible for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true.\n\nLet's assume that the first premise is true. If the vampire was awake, then according to the first premise, the mummy must have been awake. However, the second premise states that it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake. This means that the mummy was not awake.\n\nIf the mummy was not awake, then it's impossible for the vampire to have been awake, since the first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. Therefore, the conclusion that the vampire was not awake logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
