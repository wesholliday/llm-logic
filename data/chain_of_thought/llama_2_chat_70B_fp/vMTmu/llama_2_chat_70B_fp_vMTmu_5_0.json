            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a modus tollens argument, which has the following form:\n\nIf P, then Q.\nNot Q.\nTherefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy must have played tennis\". The first premise is stating that if Jeff played basketball, then it is necessary that Amy played tennis. The second premise is stating that it is not the case that Amy must have played tennis. The conclusion is that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, we need to see if it is impossible for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true.\n\nLet's assume that the first premise is true. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. This means that if Jeff played basketball, then it is necessary that Amy played tennis.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise. It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis. This means that it is not necessary that Amy played tennis.\n\nIf the first premise is true and the second premise is true, then we can conclude that it is not necessary that Jeff played basketball. In other words, it is possible that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Jeff did not play basketball\" logically follows from the premises. This means that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
