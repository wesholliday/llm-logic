            "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe argument in question is a form of modus tollens, which has the following structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck must have been blue\". The first premise states that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. The second premise states that it's not the case that the truck must have been blue. The conclusion is that the car was not red.\n\nTo determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, we need to see if it's impossible for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true.\n\nLet's assume that the first premise is true. If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue, according to the first premise. However, the second premise states that it's not the case that the truck must have been blue. This means that the truck was not blue, which in turn means that the car was not red (since the first premise states that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"the car was not red\" logically follows from the premises. It's impossible for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true, since the second premise states that the truck was not blue, which means that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
