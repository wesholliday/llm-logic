The condition of the transmission is a significant factor that can impact the car's performance, and changing the oil alone may not address the issues caused by a shot transmission.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the car will run smoothly if the transmission is shot, even if the oil is changed.\n\nAnswer: no",
