The expiration date is the date until which the manufacturer guarantees the full potency and safety of the medication. After this date, the medication may not be as effective or safe to use.\n\nGiven this, we cannot infer that taking expired medication will make you feel better. In fact, it may have reduced potency or even be harmful to consume. Therefore, we cannot make the inference that taking expired medication will make you feel better based solely on the fact that taking medication can make you feel better.\n\nAnswer: no",
