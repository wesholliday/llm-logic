However, the second part of the question introduces a new factor: eating junk food. \n\nExercising alone may lead to weight loss due to increased calorie expenditure and improved metabolism. However, if you consume junk food in excess, it can easily offset the calorie deficit created by exercise, leading to weight maintenance or even weight gain.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if you exercise and eat junk food, you will lose weight based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
