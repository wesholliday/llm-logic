The original statement does not provide any information about the language of the test, so we cannot directly infer the outcome based on the original statement alone.\n\nTo make a valid inference, we would need additional information about the relationship between studying hard and the language of the test.\n\nTherefore, based on the original statement alone, we cannot infer whether studying hard for a test in Chinese will result in passing the test.\n\nAnswer: no",
