Therefore, adding \"or zizz zump wobble\" does not contradict the original statement. In logic, when we add an option to a statement, it does not make the original statement false. Therefore, we can infer \"The quorple must be in quazzle or zizz zump wobble\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
