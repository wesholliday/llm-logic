Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car.\n2. The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet.\n\nUsing disjunctive syllogism, we can infer:\n3. The umbrella is in the car.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and the rule of disjunctive syllogism, we can infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
