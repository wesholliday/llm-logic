The second premise states that 'The missing sock isn't under the bed', which means 'not under the bed'. According to the principle of disjunctive syllogism, if one disjunct is false, the other must be true. Therefore, the conclusion 'The missing sock is in the laundry basket' logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
