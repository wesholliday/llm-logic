This principle states that if we have a disjunction (either/or statement) and one of the options is negated, then the other option must be true.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is a disjunction: 'Either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk'. The second premise negates one of the options: 'The pen isn't on my desk'. According to the principle of disjunctive syllogism, this would logically lead to the conclusion that 'The pen is in my bag'.\n\nSo, based on the principle of disjunctive syllogism, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
