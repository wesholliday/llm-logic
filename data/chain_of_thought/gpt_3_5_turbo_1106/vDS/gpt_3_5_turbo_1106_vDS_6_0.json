If we assume that both premises are true and the conclusion is false, we can check if this leads to a contradiction.\n\nAssuming the first premise \"Either the phone is in the living room or it is ringing in the kitchen\" is true, and the second premise \"The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen\" is also true, then the conclusion \"The phone is in the living room\" must be true, because if the phone isn't ringing in the kitchen, then it must be in the living room according to the first premise.\n\nSo, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
