The first premise states that either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table. The second premise states that the book isn't resting on the table. From these premises, we can logically conclude that the book must be on the shelf. This is because if it's not on the table and it must be in one of the two places mentioned in the first premise, then it must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
