The disjunctive syllogism states that if we have a disjunction (either/or statement) and one of the options is false, then the other option must be true.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is a disjunction: 'Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist'. The second premise is 'The watch isn't on his wrist'. Using the disjunctive syllogism, we can conclude that 'The watch is charging on the dresser'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
