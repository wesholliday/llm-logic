The second premise is the negation of the second option: 'The jacket isn't hanging in the closet'.\n\nUsing the principle of disjunctive syllogism, we can conclude that 'The jacket is draped over the chair', which matches the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
