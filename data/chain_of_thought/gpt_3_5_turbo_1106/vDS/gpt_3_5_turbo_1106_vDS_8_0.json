In this case, the first premise is a disjunction ('Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch'), and the second premise states that 'The remote control isn't hiding under the couch'. Therefore, we can use disjunctive syllogism to conclude that 'The remote control is on the coffee table'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
