The given argument follows the form of modus tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement \"if p then q\" and the negation of q, then we can infer the negation of p. In this case, the first premise \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is the conditional statement, and the second premise \"Alex did not finish the race\" is the negation of q. Therefore, the conclusion \"Chris did not finish the race\" is the negation of p. \n\nSo, the argument is logically valid.",
