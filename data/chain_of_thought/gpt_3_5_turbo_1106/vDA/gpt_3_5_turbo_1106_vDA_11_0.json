This means that the cake was not chocolate and the muffins were blueberry. \n\nNow, let's consider the first premise \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\". Since the cake was not chocolate, this premise does not provide any information about the muffins. Therefore, it does not contradict the assumption that the muffins were blueberry.\n\nSo, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
