The doll was not plastic (Premise)\n\nAssuming the conclusion 'The truck was not metal' is false, then the truck was metal. This contradicts the first premise, which states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. Since the assumption leads to a contradiction, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
