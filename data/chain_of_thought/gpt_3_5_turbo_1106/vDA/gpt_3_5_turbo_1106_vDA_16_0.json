The shirt was not cotton (Premise)\n\nAssume for the sake of contradiction that the conclusion 'The pants were not denim' is false. This means the pants were denim.\n\nIf the shirt was not cotton, then the first premise does not provide any information about the pants. Therefore, the conclusion 'The pants were not denim' cannot be inferred from the premises.\n\nSo, is this form of argument logically valid?",
