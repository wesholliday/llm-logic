If we assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false, we can derive a contradiction. \n\nAssuming the first premise \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and the second premise \"The apple was not red\", we can conclude that we don't have enough information to determine the color of the banana. The conclusion \"The banana was not yellow\" cannot be logically derived from the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
