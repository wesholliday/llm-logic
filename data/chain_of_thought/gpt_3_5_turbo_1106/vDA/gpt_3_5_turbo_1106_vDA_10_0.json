If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n2. The dog was not inside.\n\nNow, let's assume the conclusion is false:\n3. The cat was outside.\n\nIf we assume the conclusion is false, then we can use the first premise to infer that the dog was inside. But the second premise states that the dog was not inside, which contradicts our assumption. Therefore, the conclusion must be true.\n\nThis means that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
