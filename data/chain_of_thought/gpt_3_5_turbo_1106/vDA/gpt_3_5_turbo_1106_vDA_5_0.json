If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. (Premise)\n2. Jeff did not play basketball. (Premise)\n3. Therefore, Amy did not play tennis. (Conclusion)\n\nThis argument follows the form of modus tollens, a valid form of argument. Modus tollens states that if a conditional statement is true and the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false. In this case, the conditional statement is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis,\" and the consequent \"Amy played tennis\" is denied in the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
