The argument is in the form of a conditional statement in the first premise, and the second premise denies the antecedent of the conditional statement. This aligns with the form of the modus tollens rule of inference, which states that if we have a conditional statement \"if p then q\" and we know \"not q\", then we can infer \"not p\".\n\nGiven that the argument follows the form of the modus tollens rule of inference, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
