            "content": "To determine the logical validity of the argument, we can use the rules of inference. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. (Premise)\n2. Sam did not take a plane. (Premise)\n3. Therefore, Erin did not take a train. (Conclusion)\n\nWe can use the rule of modus tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement \"if p then q\" and we know \"not q\", then we can infer \"not p\". In this case, the first premise is a conditional statement and the second premise is \"not p\" (where p is \"Sam took a plane\" and q is \"Erin took a train\").\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer \"Erin did not take a train\" from the given premises. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
