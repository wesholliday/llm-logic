            "content": "To determine the logical validity of the argument, we can use the principle of modus tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement \"if A, then B\" and we know that B is false, then we can conclude that A is also false. \n\nIn this case, the first premise \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" can be represented as \"If A, then B\" where A is the bear in the cave and B is the wolf in the den. The second premise \"The bear was not in the cave\" can be represented as \"not A\". \n\nUsing modus tollens, if we know that \"If A, then B\" and \"not B\", then we can conclude \"not A\". Therefore, the conclusion \"The wolf was not in the den\" can be represented as \"not B\".\n\nSo, the argument is logically valid based on the principle of modus tollens.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
