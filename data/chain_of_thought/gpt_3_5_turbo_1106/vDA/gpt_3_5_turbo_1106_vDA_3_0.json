Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P then Q\" and we know that Q is false, then we can conclude that P is also false. In this case, the argument follows the form:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. (P \u2192 Q)\n2. The book was not written by James. (~P)\n3. Therefore, the book is not a mystery novel. (~Q)\n\nBy using modus tollens, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
