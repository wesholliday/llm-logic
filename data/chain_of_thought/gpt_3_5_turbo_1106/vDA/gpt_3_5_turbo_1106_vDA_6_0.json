Then, according to the first premise 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta', Sue must have chosen pizza. However, the second premise states 'Sue did not choose pizza', which contradicts our initial assumption. \n\nTherefore, if we assume the conclusion is false (i.e., Bob did choose pasta), we arrive at a contradiction. This means that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
