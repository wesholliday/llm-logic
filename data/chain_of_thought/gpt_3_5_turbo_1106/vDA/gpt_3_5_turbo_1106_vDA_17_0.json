If we assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false, we can derive a contradiction. \n\nAssuming the premises are true:\n1. If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad (Premise)\n2. Ben did not eat pasta (Premise)\n\nFrom premise 2, we can conclude:\n3. It is not the case that Ben ate pasta\n\nNow, let's assume the conclusion is false:\n4. Kate ate salad\n\nHowever, from premise 1, if Ben did not eat pasta, we cannot make any conclusion about Kate eating salad. Therefore, the conclusion 'Kate did not eat salad' is not necessarily true based on the given premises.\n\nBased on this analysis, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
