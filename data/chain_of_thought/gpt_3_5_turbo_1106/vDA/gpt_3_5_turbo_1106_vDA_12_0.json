The given argument follows the form of modus tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement \"if p then q\" and the negation of q, then we can infer the negation of p. In this case, the first premise \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is the conditional statement, and the second premise \"Joe did not go to the park\" is the negation of q. Therefore, the conclusion \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\" is the negation of p. Since the argument follows the form of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
