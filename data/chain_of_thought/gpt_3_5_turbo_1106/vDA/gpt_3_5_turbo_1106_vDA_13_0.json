If we assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false, we can derive a contradiction. \n\nAssuming the first premise \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is true, and the second premise \"The car was not red\" is also true, we can conclude that the truck was not blue. This is because if the antecedent of the first premise is false (the car was not red), then the consequent (the truck was blue) can be either true or false without affecting the truth value of the conditional statement. Therefore, the conclusion \"The truck was not blue\" is logically valid based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
