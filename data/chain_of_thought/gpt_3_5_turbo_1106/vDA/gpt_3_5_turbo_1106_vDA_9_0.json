Then, according to the first premise, Lisa must have bought the red shirt. However, the second premise states that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, which contradicts our initial assumption.\n\nTherefore, if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, it follows that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This means the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
