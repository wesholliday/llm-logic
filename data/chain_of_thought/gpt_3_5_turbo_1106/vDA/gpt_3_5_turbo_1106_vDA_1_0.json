            "content": "To determine the logical validity of the argument, we can use the rules of implication. The first premise \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" can be represented as \"M -> S\" (where M stands for Mary being at the wedding and S stands for Sue being at the wedding). The second premise \"Mary was not at the wedding\" can be represented as \"~M\" (where ~M stands for Mary not being at the wedding). \n\nNow, if we assume the first premise \"M -> S\" to be true, and the second premise \"~M\" to be true, we can use modus tollens, a valid form of argument, to conclude that \"Sue was not at the wedding\" (~S). Therefore, the conclusion \"Sue was not at the wedding\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
