            "content": "Explanation: In the original statement, the phrase \"it must\" is used to connect the two conditions \"flim on snork\" and \"blimple quazzle flim.\" When we remove \"it must\" from the statement, we are left with \"The gribble must be flim on snork and blimple quazzle flim.\" This is a valid inference because it maintains the original conditions without the connecting phrase. Therefore, we can infer \"The gribble must be flim on snork and blimple quazzle flim.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
