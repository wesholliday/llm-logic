            "content": "Explanation: In the original statement, the phrase \"it must\" is used to connect two conditions: \"The zooble must be in quork\" and \"it must quimble flim.\" When we remove \"it\" from the second condition, we are left with \"The zooble must be in quork and quimble flim,\" which still maintains the original meaning. Therefore, we can infer \"The zooble must be in quork and quimble flim\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
