It is possible that the watch is not on his wrist.\n\nGiven this information, we can infer that if the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser. This is because the first statement tells us that the watch is either charging on the dresser or on his wrist, and the second statement confirms that it is possible that the watch is not on his wrist. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
