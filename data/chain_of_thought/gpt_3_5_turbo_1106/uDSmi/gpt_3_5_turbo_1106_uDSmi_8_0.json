The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the remote control is either on the coffee table or under the couch. From the second statement, we know that it's possible that the remote control is not under the couch.\n\nGiven this information, we cannot definitively infer that the remote control is on the coffee table, as it could still be under the couch. Therefore, we cannot make the inference that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: no",
