Since \"Truck\" is true, the implication \"Car \u2192 Truck\" is satisfied regardless of the truth value of \"Car\". This means that the truth value of \"Car\" is not relevant to the truth of the implication.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude whether \"The car was red\" is true or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
