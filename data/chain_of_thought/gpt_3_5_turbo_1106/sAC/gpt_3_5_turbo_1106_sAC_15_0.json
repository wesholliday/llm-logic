This means that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. \n\nWe also know that \"Erin took a train\" is true. \n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that Sam took a plane, because if Erin took a train and the statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is true, then it follows that Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
