This means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob definitely chose pasta. \n\nNext, we are given that \"Bob chose pasta\" is true. This means that Bob indeed chose pasta.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can conclude that Sue must have chosen pizza, because if she didn't choose pizza, then the initial statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" would be false.\n\nTherefore, it follows that \"Sue chose pizza\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
