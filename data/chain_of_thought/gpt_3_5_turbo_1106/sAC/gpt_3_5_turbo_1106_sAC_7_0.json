We also know that the statement \"Chris finished the race\" is true. \n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can conclude that Chris finishing the race does not necessarily imply that Alex finished the race. This is because the first statement only tells us what happens if Alex finishes the race, but it doesn't tell us anything about what happens if Chris finishes the race.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Alex finished the race based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
