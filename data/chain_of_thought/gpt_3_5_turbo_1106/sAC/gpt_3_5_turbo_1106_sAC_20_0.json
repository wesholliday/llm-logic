If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow (If A, then B)\n2. The banana was yellow (B)\n\nWe want to determine if the apple was red (A).\n\nUsing the concept of implication, if the apple was red (A), then the banana was yellow (B). Since we know that the banana was yellow (B), it does not necessarily mean that the apple was red (A). The apple could be red or not red, and the statement \"The apple was red\" is not explicitly given or implied by the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
