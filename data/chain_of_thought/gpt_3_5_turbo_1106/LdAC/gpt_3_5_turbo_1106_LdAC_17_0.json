Then, we have the statement \"Kate ate salad\" which we can represent as \"Kate\". \n\nNow, if we know that \"Ben -> Kate\" and \"Kate\" is true, we can logically deduce that \"Ben\" is also true. This is because if the condition \"Ben -> Kate\" is true and the result \"Kate\" is true, then the condition \"Ben\" must also be true.\n\nSo, based on the given statements, we can logically deduce that \"Ben ate pasta\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
