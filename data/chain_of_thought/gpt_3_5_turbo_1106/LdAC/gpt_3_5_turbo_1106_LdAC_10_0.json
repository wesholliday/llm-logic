It means that if the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside. However, it does not necessarily mean that if the cat is outside, the dog must be inside.\n\n2. \"The cat was outside\" - This statement tells us the location of the cat.\n\nGiven these statements, we cannot logically deduce that \"The dog was inside\" because the first statement does not provide a direct relationship between the location of the cat and the location of the dog. It only tells us about the relationship between the dog being inside and the cat being outside.\n\nAnswer: no",
