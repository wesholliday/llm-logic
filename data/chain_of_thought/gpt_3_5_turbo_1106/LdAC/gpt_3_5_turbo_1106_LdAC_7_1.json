C (Chris finished the race)\n\nNow, we will use modus ponens, a basic rule of inference in logic:\n- Modus Ponens: If we have a conditional statement (if A, then B) and we know A is true, then we can deduce that B is true.\n\nSo, applying modus ponens to the given statements:\n- If A, then C\n- A is true (from the second statement, we know Chris finished the race)\n\nWe can deduce:\n- C is true (Chris finished the race)\n\nThen, we can conclude:\n- Alex finished the race, as per the given conditional statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
