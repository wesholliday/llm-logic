However, it does not tell us anything about the color of the car if the truck is blue.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"The truck was blue.\" This tells us the color of the truck, but it does not provide any information about the color of the car.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot logically deduce the color of the car. The first statement only tells us about the relationship between the car and the truck, and the second statement only tells us about the color of the truck. Therefore, we cannot deduce the color of the car from these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
