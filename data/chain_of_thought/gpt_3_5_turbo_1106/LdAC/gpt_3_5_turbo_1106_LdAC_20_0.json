However, we cannot directly deduce the color of the apple from this information alone. The conditional statement only tells us about the relationship between the colors of the apple and the banana, but it does not provide direct information about the color of the apple.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce \"The apple was red\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
