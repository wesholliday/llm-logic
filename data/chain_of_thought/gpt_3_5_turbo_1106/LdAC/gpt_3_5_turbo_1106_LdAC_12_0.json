This is because if the first statement is true (if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo) and the second statement is true (Lucy went to the zoo), then it logically follows that Joe went to the park.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can deduce that Joe went to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
