The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" can be represented as \"T \u2192 J\" where T stands for \"Tom watched football\" and J stands for \"Jen watched basketball\". The second statement \"Jen watched basketball\" can be represented as \"J\". \n\nNow, if we know that \"T \u2192 J\" and \"J\" are both true, we can logically deduce whether \"T\" is true or false based on the truth of the given statements. \n\nSo, can we logically deduce \"Tom watched football\" from the given statements?",
