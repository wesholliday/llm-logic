In other words, since the pants were denim, the condition \"If the shirt was cotton\" has been met. \n\nSince the condition of the conditional statement has been satisfied, we can conclude that the consequent \"then the pants were denim\" is also true. Therefore, as a result of the given information, we can logically deduce that \"The shirt was cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
