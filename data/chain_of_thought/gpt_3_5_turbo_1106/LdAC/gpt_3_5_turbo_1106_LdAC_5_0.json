However, this does not necessarily mean that Jeff played basketball. The original statement only tells us what would happen if Jeff played basketball, but it doesn't tell us anything about what happens if he didn't play basketball.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce that Jeff played basketball based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
