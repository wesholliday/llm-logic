The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" \n\nSo, in this case, the contrapositive of \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" is \"If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nNow, let's compare the original statement with its contrapositive to see if they are equivalent.\n\nOriginal statement: If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\nContrapositive: If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\n\nBy comparing the original statement with its contrapositive, we can see that they are equivalent. Therefore, we can infer \"If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
