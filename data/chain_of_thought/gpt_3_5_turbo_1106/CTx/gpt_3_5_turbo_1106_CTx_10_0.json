The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If p, then q\" is \"If not q, then not p.\" So, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nIn this case, the original statement is \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged.\" \n\nSo, yes, we can infer \"If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged\" from the given statement. \n\nAnswer: yes",
