The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nTo find the contrapositive, we first negate both P and Q. The negation of \"the flob was skizzled\" is \"the flob was not skizzled,\" and the negation of \"the flob movated\" is \"the flob did not movated.\" Then we switch the order and add \"if\" and \"then\" to form the contrapositive statement.\n\nSo, the contrapositive of the original statement is \"If the flob did not movated, then the flob was not skizzled.\"\n\nNow, based on this analysis, can we infer \"If the flob did not movated, then the flob was not skizzled\" from the given statement?\n\nAnswer: yes",
