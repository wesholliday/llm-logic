The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If p, then q\" is \"If not q, then not p.\"\n\nSo, the contrapositive of \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled\" is \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nNow, we need to check if the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the given statement. If the contrapositive is true, then we can infer the statement \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nLet's evaluate the contrapositive to see if it holds true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
