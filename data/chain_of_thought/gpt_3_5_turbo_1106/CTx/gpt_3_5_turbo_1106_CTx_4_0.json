In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\nTo find the contrapositive, we first negate both P and Q. The negation of \"the fribble was snurgled\" is \"the fribble was not snurgled\", and the negation of \"the fribble crinked\" is \"the fribble did not crink\".\n\nSo, the contrapositive of the original statement is \"If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\".\n\nNow, let's determine if we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
