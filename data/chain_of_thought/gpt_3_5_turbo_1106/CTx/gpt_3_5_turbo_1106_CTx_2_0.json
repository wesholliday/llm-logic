The original statement is: \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n2. The contrapositive of this statement is: \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we can infer \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
