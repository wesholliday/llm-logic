The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nTo find the contrapositive, we first negate both P and Q. The negation of \"the clug was fleeked\" is \"the clug was not fleeked,\" and the negation of \"the clug snugged\" is \"the clug did not snugged.\" Then we switch the order and add \"not\" to both P and Q.\n\nSo, the contrapositive of the original statement is \"If the clug did not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked.\"\n\nNow, let's determine if we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
