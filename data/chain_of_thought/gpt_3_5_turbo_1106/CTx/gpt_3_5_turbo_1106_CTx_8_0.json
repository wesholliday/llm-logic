The contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" is \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\" Therefore, we can infer \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
