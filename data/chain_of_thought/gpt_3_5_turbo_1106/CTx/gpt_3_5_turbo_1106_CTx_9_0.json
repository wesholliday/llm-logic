The original statement \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\" is a conditional statement of the form \"if p, then q\". The second statement \"If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked\" is the contrapositive of the original statement. According to the rules of logical inference, the contrapositive of a true conditional statement is also true. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
