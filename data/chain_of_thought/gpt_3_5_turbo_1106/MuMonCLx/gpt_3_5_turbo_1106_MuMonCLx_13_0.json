Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The flimble must be in frozz\" from the original statement alone. It is possible that the flimble must be in both \"frozz\" and \"zibber bimboozle,\" or it could be in \"frozz\" without necessarily being in \"zibber bimboozle.\" Without further information, we cannot make the inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
