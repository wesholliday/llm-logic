However, we cannot infer that the froodle must only be \"quork blurble\" based on this statement alone. The statement does not exclude the possibility of other qualities being required in addition to \"quork blurble\". Therefore, we cannot infer \"The froodle must be quork blurble\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
