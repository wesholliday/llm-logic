If the alien might not have visited Mars, it means there is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars. This does not necessarily mean that the alien must have visited Mars, but it leaves open the possibility that the alien may or may not have visited Mars.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars\" from \"The alien might not have visited Mars.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
