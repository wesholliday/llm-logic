If Alex might not have finished the race, it means there is a possibility that he did not finish. This does not necessarily mean that he definitely did not finish, but it opens up the possibility that he may not have finished. Therefore, we can infer that it's not the case that Alex must have finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
