This leaves room for uncertainty about the location of the sunglasses.\n\nOn the other hand, the inferred statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag\" asserts that it is not necessary for the sunglasses to be in her bag. This conclusion is consistent with the original statement because if the sunglasses might not be in her bag, then it's true that they don't have to be in her bag.\n\nGiven the logical relationship between the original statement and the inferred statement, it is reasonable to infer \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag\" from \"The sunglasses might not be in her bag\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
