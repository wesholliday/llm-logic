The original statement \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\" leaves open the possibility that Lisa did buy the red shirt or did not buy the red shirt. Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" from the original statement.\n\nFirst, we recognize that \"might not\" implies uncertainty, leaving open the possibility of both options.\n\nThen we negate the statement to match the form of \"It's not the case that.\"\n\nSo, the original statement \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\" supports the inference \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
