If the watch might not be charging on the dresser, it means there is a possibility that it is not charging on the dresser, but it does not necessarily mean that it must be charging on the dresser. Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
