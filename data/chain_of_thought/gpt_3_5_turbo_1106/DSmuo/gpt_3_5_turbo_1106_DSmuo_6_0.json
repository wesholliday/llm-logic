We can use De Morgan's laws to rewrite \u00ac(P \u2227 Q) as (\u00acP \u2228 \u00acQ).\n\n4. Now we can use the distributive law to combine (\u00acP \u2228 \u00acQ) and (R \u2228 Q) to get (\u00acP \u2228 \u00acQ) \u2228 (R \u2228 Q).\n\n5. By applying the law of distribution, we get (\u00acP \u2228 R) \u2228 (\u00acQ \u2228 Q).\n\n6. The statement (\u00acQ \u2228 Q) is always true, so we can simplify the expression to (\u00acP \u2228 R) \u2228 True, which is always true.\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot infer that \"The phone is in the living room\" with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no",
