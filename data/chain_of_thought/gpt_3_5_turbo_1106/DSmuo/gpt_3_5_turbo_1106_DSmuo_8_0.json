We can use the rule of inference called Disjunctive Syllogism, which states that if we have a disjunction (A \u2228 B) and the negation of one of the options (\u00acB), then we can infer the other option (A).\n\nNow, let's apply the Disjunctive Syllogism to the given statements to see if we can infer \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\nAnswer:",
