Translate the given statements into logical expressions: \n   - Let A represent \"the shoes must be lined up by the door\"\n   - Let B represent \"the shoes are in the closet\"\n   \n   The given statements can be represented as:\n   - ~A (It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door)\n   - A v B (Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door)\n\n2. Apply the principle of disjunctive syllogism, which states that if one of the disjuncts is false, then the other must be true.\n   \n   Applying the principle, if it's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door (~A) and either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door (A v B), we can infer that the shoes must be in the closet (B).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The shoes are in the closet.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
