First, let's represent the statements:\n   - Let A be \"The notebook must be sitting on the nightstand\"\n   - Let B be \"The notebook is in the drawer\"\n\n2. The given statements can be represented as:\n   - \u00acA (It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand)\n   - A \u2228 B (Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand)\n\n3. We can use the rule of inference called Disjunctive Syllogism, which states that if we have a disjunction (A \u2228 B) and the negation of one of the disjuncts (\u00acA), then we can infer the other disjunct (B).\n\n4. Applying the Disjunctive Syllogism to the given statements, we can infer:\n   - B (The notebook is in the drawer)\n\nAnswer: yes",
