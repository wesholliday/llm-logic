(S v C)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"The sneg is crampled\" from these two statements using the rules of inference. We'll use the principle of disjunctive syllogism, which states that if one of two disjuncts is false, then the other must be true. \n\nSo, we can say:\n1. From the second premise, if S is true, then C is false.\n2. From the first premise, S is false.\n\nTherefore, by disjunctive syllogism, we can infer \"The sneg is crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
