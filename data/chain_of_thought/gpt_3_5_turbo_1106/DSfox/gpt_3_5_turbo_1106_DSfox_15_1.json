The Disjunctive Syllogism states that if either one of the disjuncts (in this case, \"The dreb is spened\" or \"it is vroombed\") is true, then the other must be false. Given that \"The dreb is not spened\" and \"Either the dreb is spened or it is vroombed,\" we can now deduce that \"The dreb is vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
