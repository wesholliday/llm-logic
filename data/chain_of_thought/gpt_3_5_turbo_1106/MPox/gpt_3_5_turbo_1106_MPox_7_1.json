If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\n\nNext, we can use modus ponens, the valid form of deductive reasoning, to determine if the conclusion can be inferred from the premises.\n\nModus Ponens: If P implies Q, and P is true, then Q is true.\nIn this case, P = \"The whiffle was shanked\" and Q = \"The whiffle tinked.\"\nIf P is true and \"If P then Q\" is true, then we can infer Q.\n\nNow let's assess the truth of the statements and whether the conclusion can be inferred.\n\nAnswer: No",
