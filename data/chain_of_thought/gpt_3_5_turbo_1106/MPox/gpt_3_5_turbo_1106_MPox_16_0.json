Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we also have the premise \"P,\" then we can infer the conclusion \"Q.\"\n\nIn this case, \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" is the conditional statement, and \"The sneg was crampled\" is the premise. Therefore, we can use modus ponens to infer \"The sneg sproted the frink.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
