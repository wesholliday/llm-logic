However, we cannot directly infer that \"It was varnished\" without knowing what \"it\" refers to. The statements only provide a conditional relationship between being plinked and being varnished, but they do not provide information about whether something specific was varnished.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It was varnished\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
