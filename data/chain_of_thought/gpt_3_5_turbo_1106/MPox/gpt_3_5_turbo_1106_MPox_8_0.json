Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we also have the premise \"P\", then we can infer \"Q\".\n\nIn this case, the given statements are:\n1. The sprocket was cranked.\n2. If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n\nUsing modus ponens:\n- If the sprocket was cranked (P), then the sprocket was daggled (Q).\n- The sprocket was cranked (P).\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The sprocket was daggled\" (Q).\n\nAnswer: yes",
