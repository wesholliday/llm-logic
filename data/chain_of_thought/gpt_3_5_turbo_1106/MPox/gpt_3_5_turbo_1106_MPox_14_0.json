The first statement \"The clug was fleeked\" does not provide any information about the clug being snugged. The second statement \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\" is a conditional statement, which means that if the clug was fleeked, then it snugged. However, we don't have any information about whether the clug was actually fleeked. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The clug snugged\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
