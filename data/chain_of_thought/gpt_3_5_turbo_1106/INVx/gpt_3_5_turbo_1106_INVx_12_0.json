The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If p, then q\" is \"If not q, then not p.\" \n\nSo, the contrapositive of \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint\" is \"If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped.\" \n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the smip was not shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
