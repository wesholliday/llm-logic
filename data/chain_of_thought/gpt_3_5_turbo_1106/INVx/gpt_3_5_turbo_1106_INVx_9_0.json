The contrapositive of \"if p, then q\" is \"if not q, then not p.\"\n\nSo, the contrapositive of the original statement \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\" is \"If the twonk was not varnished, then it was not plinked.\"\n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive with the negation of the original statement: \"If the twonk was not plinked, then it was not varnished.\"\n\nBy comparing the contrapositive and the negation, we can see that they are equivalent. Therefore, we can infer \"If the twonk was not plinked, then it was not varnished\" from the original statement \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
