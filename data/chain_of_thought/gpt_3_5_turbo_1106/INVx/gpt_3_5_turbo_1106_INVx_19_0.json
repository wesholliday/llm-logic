The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If p, then q\" is \"If not q, then not p.\" In this case, the original statement is \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged,\" so the contrapositive is \"If the smonk was not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled.\" \n\nSo, the contrapositive of the given statement is \"If the smonk was not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled.\" Therefore, we can infer \"If the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
