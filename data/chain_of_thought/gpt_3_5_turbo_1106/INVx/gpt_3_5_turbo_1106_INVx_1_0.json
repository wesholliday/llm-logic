The contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\" In this case, the original statement is \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\" \n\nSo, the contrapositive of the original statement is \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\" \n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive with the second statement \"If the flugel was not blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled.\" \n\nIf the contrapositive and the second statement are the same, then we can infer the second statement from the original. \n\nAnswer: yes",
