The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" \n\nSo, the contrapositive of \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\" is \"If the flob was not movated, then the flob was not skizzled.\"\n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive with the statement \"If the flob was not skizzled, then the flob was not movated.\" If the contrapositive matches the statement, then we can infer the statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
