The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" \n\nSo, the contrapositive of \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint\" is \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\"\n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive with the second statement \"If the wug was not flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint.\" We can see that the contrapositive and the second statement are equivalent.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the wug was not flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
