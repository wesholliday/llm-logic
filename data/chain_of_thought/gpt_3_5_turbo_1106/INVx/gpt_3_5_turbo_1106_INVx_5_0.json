The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\" is \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled.\" \n\nSo, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer \"If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
