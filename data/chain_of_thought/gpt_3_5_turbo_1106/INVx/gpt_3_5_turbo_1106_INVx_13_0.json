The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" \n\nSo, the contrapositive of \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\" is \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged.\" \n\nNow, let's compare the original statement and its contrapositive to see if they are equivalent. If they are, then we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nOriginal statement: If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\nContrapositive: If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged\n\nBy comparing the original statement and its contrapositive, we can see that they are not equivalent. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no",
