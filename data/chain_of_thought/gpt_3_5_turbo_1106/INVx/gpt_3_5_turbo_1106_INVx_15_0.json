The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nSo, the contrapositive of the original statement is \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive with the inferred statement \"If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
