The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\" is \"If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled.\" \n\nSo, the contrapositive of the original statement does not match the statement \"If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink.\" Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
