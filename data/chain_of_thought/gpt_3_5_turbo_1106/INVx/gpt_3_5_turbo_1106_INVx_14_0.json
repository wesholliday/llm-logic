The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"if p, then q\" is \"if not q, then not p.\"\n\nSo, if we take the contrapositive of the original statement \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged,\" we get \"If the clug did not snug, then the clug was not fleeked.\"\n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive with the inferred statement \"If the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged.\" They are the same, so the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
