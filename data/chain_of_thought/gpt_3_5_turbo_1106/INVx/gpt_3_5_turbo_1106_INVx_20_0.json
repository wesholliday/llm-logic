The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" is \"If it did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered.\" \n\nSo, if we can infer \"If the fleeg was not bluttered, then it did not surn\" from the original statement, it means that the contrapositive is true.\n\nNow, let's check if the contrapositive is true. If the fleeg did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered. This is not necessarily true because there could be other reasons why the fleeg did not surn. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the fleeg was not bluttered, then it did not surn\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
