The contrapositive of \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\" \n\nSo, the contrapositive of \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" is \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\"\n\nNow, let's compare the original statement and its contrapositive to see if they are equivalent.\n\nOriginal statement: If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\nContrapositive: If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed\n\nBy comparing the original statement and its contrapositive, we can see that they are equivalent. Therefore, we can infer \"If the grommet was not sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
