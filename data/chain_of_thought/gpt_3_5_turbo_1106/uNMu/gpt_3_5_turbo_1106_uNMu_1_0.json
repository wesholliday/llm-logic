It simply means that her presence at the wedding is not a requirement or necessity. There could be other reasons for her to be at the wedding or not, so we cannot definitively infer that she might not have been there.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Mary might not have been at the wedding based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
