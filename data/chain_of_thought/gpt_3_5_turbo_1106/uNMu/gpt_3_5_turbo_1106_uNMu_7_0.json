The original statement \"Alex must have finished the race\" can be negated to \"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race.\" This negation does not necessarily mean that Alex might not have finished the race, as there could be other possibilities such as Alex finishing the race but not necessarily being required to do so. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that Alex might not have finished the race based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
