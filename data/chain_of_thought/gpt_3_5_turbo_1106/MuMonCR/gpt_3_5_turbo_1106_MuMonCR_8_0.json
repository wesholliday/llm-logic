However, it does not explicitly state that the restaurant served Italian cuisine on days other than Monday. It is possible that the restaurant only served Italian cuisine on days other than Monday, or that it served a different type of cuisine on other days. Therefore, we cannot infer that the restaurant must have served Italian cuisine based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
