            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can use the principle of contraposition. The principle of contraposition states that if a conditional statement \"if A, then B\" is true, then its contrapositive \"if not B, then not A\" is also true.\n\nIn this case, the premise \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" can be represented as \"If A, then B\". The conclusion \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton\" can be represented as \"If B, then A\".\n\nNow, applying the principle of contraposition, we can see that the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
