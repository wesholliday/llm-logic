            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can use the principle of contraposition. The contrapositive of the premise \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". In this case, the premise \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" can be restated as \"If not blueberry muffins, then not chocolate cake\". \n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive of the premise with the conclusion \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate\". If the contrapositive of the premise matches the conclusion, then the argument is logically valid.\n\nLet's check:\nContrapositive of the premise: If not blueberry muffins, then not chocolate cake\nConclusion: If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate\n\nThe contrapositive of the premise matches the conclusion, so the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
