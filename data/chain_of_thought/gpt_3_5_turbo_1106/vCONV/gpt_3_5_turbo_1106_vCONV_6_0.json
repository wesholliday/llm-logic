The premise \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" can be restated as \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\" using contraposition. \n\nNow, let's compare the premise and the conclusion. The conclusion \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza\" is the contrapositive of the premise. \n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
