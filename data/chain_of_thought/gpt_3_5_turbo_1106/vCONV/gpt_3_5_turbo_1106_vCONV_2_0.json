The premise \"If A, then B\" can be contraposed to \"If not B, then not A.\" Applying this to the given premise, we get \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\" This contraposed statement matches the form of the conclusion \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest.\" Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
