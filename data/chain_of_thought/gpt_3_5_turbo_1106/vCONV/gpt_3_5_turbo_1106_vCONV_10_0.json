The premise \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" can be restated as \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside\" using contraposition. \n\nNow, let's compare the premise and the conclusion. The conclusion \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside\" is the contrapositive of the premise. This means that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
