The premise \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" can be rewritten as \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\" using contraposition. Similarly, the conclusion \"If the truck was blue, then the car was red\" can be rewritten as \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\" using contraposition.\n\nNow, if we compare the contrapositive of the premise with the conclusion, we can see that they match. This means that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
