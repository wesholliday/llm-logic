The premise \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" can be restated as \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\" using contraposition. Similarly, the conclusion \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red\" can be restated as \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\" using contraposition.\n\nNow, if we compare the restated premise and conclusion, we can see that they have the same logical form. This means that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
