The contrapositive of the premise \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\" If we can show that the conclusion \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball\" is logically equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise, then the argument is valid.\n\nFirst, let's consider the contrapositive of the premise: \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\" This statement is logically equivalent to the conclusion \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball\" because they both express the same relationship between Amy playing tennis and Jeff playing basketball.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
