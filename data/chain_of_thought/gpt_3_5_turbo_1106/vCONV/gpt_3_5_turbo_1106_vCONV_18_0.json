The premise \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" can be restated as \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\" Similarly, the conclusion \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic\" can be restated as \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\" \n\nNow, the argument is valid if the contrapositive of the premise leads to the conclusion. In this case, the contrapositive of the premise does lead to the conclusion, so the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
