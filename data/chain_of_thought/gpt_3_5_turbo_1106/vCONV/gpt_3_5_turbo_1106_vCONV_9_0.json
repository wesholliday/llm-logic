            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can use the principle of contraposition. The contrapositive of the premise \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". In this case, the premise \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" can be restated as \"If not Mark bought the blue shirt, then not Lisa bought the red shirt\". \n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive of the premise with the conclusion \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt\". If the conclusion matches the contrapositive of the premise, then the argument is logically valid.\n\nLet's check if the conclusion matches the contrapositive of the premise. \n\nContrapositive of the premise: If not Mark bought the blue shirt, then not Lisa bought the red shirt.\nConclusion: If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nBy comparing the two, we can see that the conclusion matches the contrapositive of the premise. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
