The contrapositive of the premise \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" is \"If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\" If we can show that the conclusion \"If Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta\" is equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise, then the argument is logically valid.\n\nLet's check if the conclusion is equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise:\n\nConclusion: \"If Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta\"\nContrapositive of the premise: \"If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\"\n\nBy comparing the conclusion and the contrapositive of the premise, we can see that they are not equivalent. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
