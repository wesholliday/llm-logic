In this case, the premise \"If the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den\" can be represented as \"if p then q\" and the conclusion \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case\" can be represented as \"if q then p\". \n\nSo, the argument can be represented as:\nPremise: If p then q\nConclusion: If q then p\n\nNow, we can use the hypothetical syllogism to determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. \n\nAnswer: yes",
