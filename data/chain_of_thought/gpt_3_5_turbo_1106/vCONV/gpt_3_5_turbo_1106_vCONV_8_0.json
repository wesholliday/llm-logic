            "content": "To determine the logical validity of the argument, we can use the principle of contraposition. The premise \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" can be restated as \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake\" using contraposition. \n\nNow, let's compare the premise and the conclusion. The premise is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" and the conclusion is \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.\" \n\nBy comparing the contrapositive of the premise with the conclusion, we can see that they are logically equivalent. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
