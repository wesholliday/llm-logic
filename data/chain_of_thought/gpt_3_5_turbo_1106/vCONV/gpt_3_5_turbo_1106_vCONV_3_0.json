The argument \"If A, then B\" is logically equivalent to \"If not B, then not A\" (the contrapositive). So, the premise \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is logically equivalent to \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\" \n\nNow, let's compare the conclusion \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James\" with the logical equivalent form. The conclusion is indeed the logical equivalent of the premise, so the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
