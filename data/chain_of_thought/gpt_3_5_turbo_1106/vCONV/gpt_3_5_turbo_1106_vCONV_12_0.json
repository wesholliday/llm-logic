            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can use the principle of contraposition. The contrapositive of the premise \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". In this case, the premise \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" can be restated as \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\". \n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive of the premise with the conclusion \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park\". If we substitute \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\" into the conclusion, we get \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe went to the park\", which matches the contrapositive of the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
