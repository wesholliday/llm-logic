The premise \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" can be represented as \"If A, then B\" where A is the alien visiting Mars and B is the robot visiting Jupiter. The conclusion \"If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars\" can be represented as \"If B, then A\".\n\nNow, in a hypothetical syllogism, if the antecedent of the conclusion matches the consequent of the premise, the argument is valid. In this case, the antecedent of the conclusion (B) matches the consequent of the premise (B), so the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
