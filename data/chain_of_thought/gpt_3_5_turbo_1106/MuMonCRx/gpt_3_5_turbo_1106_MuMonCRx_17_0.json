If we remove the word \"frazzle\" from the statement, we are left with \"The flonk must be quank by quimble.\" This is a valid inference because if the flonk must be both frazzle and quank by quimble, then it must also be quank by quimble. Therefore, we can infer \"The flonk must be quank by quimble\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
