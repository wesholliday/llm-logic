It only states that the floob must be in fribble and fribble glorp, which could mean that the floob is a part of both fribble and fribble glorp, but not necessarily the combination of the two. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The floob must be fribble glorp\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
