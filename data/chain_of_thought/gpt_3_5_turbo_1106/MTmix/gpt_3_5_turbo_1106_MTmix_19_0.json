This means that if the smonk was vreebled, then it definitely plagged.\n\n- The smonk might not have plagged. This suggests that it's possible that the smonk did not plagged.\n\nGiven these statements, we cannot infer whether the smonk was vreebled or not. The possibility that the smonk might not have plagged does not necessarily mean that it was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: no",
