So, if the splat did not quank, then it could not have been morphed.\n\nNow, let's consider statement 2. It says \"The splat might not have quanked.\" This means there is a possibility that the splat did not quank.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that it is possible that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
