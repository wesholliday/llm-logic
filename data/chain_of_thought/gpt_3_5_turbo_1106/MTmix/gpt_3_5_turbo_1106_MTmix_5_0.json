However, the second statement tells us that the zinger might not have been smoogled.\n\nGiven these statements, we cannot infer that the zinger was not fraggled. This is because the second statement only tells us that the zinger might not have been smoogled, but it doesn't provide conclusive information about whether the zinger was fraggled or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
