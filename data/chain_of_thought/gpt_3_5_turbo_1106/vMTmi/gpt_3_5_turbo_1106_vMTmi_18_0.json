Then, according to the first premise, the truck must have been metal. But the second premise states that the truck might not have been metal, which contradicts our initial assumption. Therefore, the assumption that the doll was plastic leads to a contradiction.\n\nNext, assume that the doll was not plastic. Then, the conclusion that the doll was not plastic follows directly from this assumption.\n\nSince both assumptions lead to the conclusion, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
