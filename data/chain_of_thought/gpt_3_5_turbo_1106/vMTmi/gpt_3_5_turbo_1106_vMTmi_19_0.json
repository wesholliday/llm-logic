Then, according to the first premise, Jen must have watched basketball. However, the second premise states that Jen might not have watched basketball, which contradicts our initial assumption. Therefore, our assumption that Tom watched football leads to a contradiction.\n\nThis means that the conclusion 'Tom did not watch football' logically follows from the premises, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
