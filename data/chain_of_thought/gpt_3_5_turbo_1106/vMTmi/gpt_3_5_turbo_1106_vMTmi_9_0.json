Then, according to the first premise, Mark must have bought the blue shirt. However, the second premise states that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, which contradicts our initial assumption. Therefore, the assumption that Lisa bought the red shirt leads to a contradiction.\n\nNext, assume that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. In this case, the first premise does not provide any information about what Mark bought, so it is possible that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This assumption does not lead to a contradiction.\n\nSince assuming the negation of the conclusion does not lead to a contradiction, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
