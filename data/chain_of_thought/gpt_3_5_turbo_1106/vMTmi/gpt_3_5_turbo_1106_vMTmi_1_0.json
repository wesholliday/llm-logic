Then, according to the first premise, Sue must have been at the wedding. However, the second premise states that Sue might not have been at the wedding, which contradicts our initial assumption. \n\nTherefore, the assumption that Mary was at the wedding leads to a contradiction, and we can conclude that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
