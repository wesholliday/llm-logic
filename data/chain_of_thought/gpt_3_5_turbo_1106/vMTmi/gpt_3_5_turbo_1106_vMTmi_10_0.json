Then, according to the first premise, the cat must have been outside. However, the second premise states that the cat might not have been outside, which contradicts the first premise. \n\nTherefore, the assumption that the dog was inside leads to a contradiction, so the conclusion that the dog was not inside must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
