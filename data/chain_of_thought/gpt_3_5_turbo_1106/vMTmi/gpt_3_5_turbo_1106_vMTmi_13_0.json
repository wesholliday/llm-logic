Then, by the first premise, the truck must have been blue. However, the second premise states that the truck might not have been blue, which contradicts our initial assumption. Therefore, the assumption that the car was red leads to a contradiction.\n\nNow, assume the car was not red. In this case, the conclusion aligns with our assumption, as the car was not red. Therefore, there is no contradiction in this case.\n\nSince assuming the negation of the conclusion does not lead to a contradiction, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
