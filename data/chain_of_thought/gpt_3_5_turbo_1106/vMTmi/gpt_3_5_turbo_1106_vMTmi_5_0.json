Then, according to the first premise, Amy must have played tennis. However, the second premise states that Amy might not have played tennis, which contradicts the initial assumption. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion 'Jeff did not play basketball' logically follows from the premises, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
