If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. (Premise)\n2. Kate might not have eaten salad. (Premise)\n3. Assume Ben ate pasta. \n   - From premise 1, if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. \n   - But premise 2 states that Kate might not have eaten salad, which contradicts the implication in premise 1. \n   - Therefore, our assumption that Ben ate pasta leads to a contradiction. \n4. Thus, it must be the case that Ben did not eat pasta. \n\nThis argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows from the premises using the method of proof by contradiction.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
