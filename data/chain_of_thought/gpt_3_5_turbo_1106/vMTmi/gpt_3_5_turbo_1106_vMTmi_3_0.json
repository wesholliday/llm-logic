The first premise is a conditional statement, and the second premise contradicts the consequent of the conditional statement. This allows us to use the rule of denying the consequent, which states that if a conditional statement is true and its consequent is false, then its antecedent must be false. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
