According to the first premise, if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter. However, the second premise states that the robot might not have visited Jupiter, which contradicts the first premise. \n\nTherefore, if we assume the opposite, that the alien did not visit Mars, then the conclusion follows logically. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
