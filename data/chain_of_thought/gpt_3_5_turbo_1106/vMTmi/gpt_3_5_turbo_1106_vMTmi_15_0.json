Then, according to the first premise, Erin must have taken a train. However, the second premise states that Erin might not have taken a train, which contradicts our initial assumption. Therefore, our assumption that Sam took a plane leads to a contradiction.\n\nSince assuming the opposite of the conclusion leads to a contradiction, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
