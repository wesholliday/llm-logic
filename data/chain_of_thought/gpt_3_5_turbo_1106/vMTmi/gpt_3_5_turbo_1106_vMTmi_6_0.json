According to the first premise, if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. However, the second premise states that Bob might not have chosen pasta, which contradicts the first premise. \n\nTherefore, the assumption that Sue chose pizza leads to a contradiction. This means that the conclusion 'Sue did not choose pizza' is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
