Then, according to the first premise, Chris must have finished the race as well. However, the second premise states that Chris might not have finished the race, which contradicts our initial assumption. Therefore, our assumption that Alex finished the race leads to a contradiction.\n\nNext, we can assume that Alex did not finish the race. In this case, the conclusion aligns with this assumption, and there is no contradiction.\n\nBased on this analysis, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
