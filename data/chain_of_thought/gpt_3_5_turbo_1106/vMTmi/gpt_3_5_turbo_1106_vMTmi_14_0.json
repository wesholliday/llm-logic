Then, according to the first premise, the wolf must have been in the den. However, the second premise states that the wolf might not have been in the den, which contradicts our initial assumption. Therefore, the assumption that the bear was in the cave leads to a contradiction.\n\nNow, assume the bear was not in the cave. In this case, the first premise does not make any specific claim about the wolf's location, so it is possible that the wolf was not in the den. This aligns with the second premise. Therefore, the assumption that the bear was not in the cave does not lead to a contradiction.\n\nSince assuming the negation of the conclusion does not lead to a contradiction, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
