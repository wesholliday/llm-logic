If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n2. The banana might not have been yellow.\n\nNow, let's assume the conclusion 'The apple was red' is false. This means the apple was not red. \n\nIf the apple was not red, then the first premise 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow' does not lead to any contradiction. \n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
