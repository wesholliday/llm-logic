From the first premise, if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\n3. But the second premise states that the muffins might not have been blueberry, which contradicts the first premise.\n4. Therefore, the assumption that the cake was chocolate leads to a contradiction.\n\nNow, let's assume the cake was not chocolate.\n1. From the first premise, if the cake was not chocolate, then the argument does not make any specific claim about the muffins.\n2. The second premise does not contradict this assumption.\n3. Therefore, the assumption that the cake was not chocolate does not lead to a contradiction.\n\nBased on this analysis, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
