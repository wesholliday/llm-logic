Then, according to the first premise, Lucy must have gone to the zoo. However, the second premise states that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo, which contradicts our initial assumption. Therefore, our assumption that Joe went to the park leads to a contradiction.\n\nSince assuming the opposite of the conclusion leads to a contradiction, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
