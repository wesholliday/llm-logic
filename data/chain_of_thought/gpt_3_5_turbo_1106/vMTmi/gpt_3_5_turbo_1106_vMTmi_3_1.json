'If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel'\n2. 'The book might not be a mystery novel'\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion:\n3. 'The book was not written by James'\n\nWe can use a method called modus tollens to assess the validity of the argument. Modus tollens states that if the consequent of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent must also be false.\n\nSo, if we apply modus tollens to the first premise (\"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\") and the second premise (\"The book might not be a mystery novel\"), we get the following:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\n2. The book might not be a mystery novel\n3.
