Therefore, the conclusion \"The car was not red\" seems to logically follow from the premises.\n\nNow, it's important to confirm that the premises are true in the context of the argument. Let's assume the truth of the premises and determine if the conclusion logically follows.\n\nThe first premise states that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.

Let's imagine a scenario where the first premise is true, the second premise is true, and the conclusion is false. Specifically, consider a situation where the car is red, the truck is not blue, and the conclusion \"The car was not red\" is false. By doing so, we can test if the premises being true lead to the conclusion being false.\n\nNow, if the car was red and the truck was not blue, then the first premise \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\" is false, because the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. Similarly, the second premise \"The truck might not have been blue\" is also true in this scenario.\n\nGiven this counterexample, we find that the premises being true do not guarantee the truth of the conclusion, which means the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
