            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can use the rules of inference. The first premise 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake' is a conditional statement. The second premise 'The mummy might not have been awake' suggests that it is possible that the mummy was not awake. From these premises, we can deduce that the conclusion 'The vampire was not awake' follows logically if we assume the truth of the premises.\n\nNow let's use the rules of inference to evaluate the validity of the argument.\n\n1. Modus Tollens states that if P implies Q and Q is false, then P must be false. This can be used to show that the vampire was not awake based on the given premises.\n\n2. The law of non-contradiction states that a statement and its negation cannot both be true at the same time.\n\nGiven the truth of the premises, we can infer the conclusion using modus tollens, which establishes the logical validity of the argument.\n\nTherefore, the form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
