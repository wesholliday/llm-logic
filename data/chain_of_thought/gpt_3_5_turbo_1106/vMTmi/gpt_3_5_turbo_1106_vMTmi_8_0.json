Then, according to the first premise, the mummy must have been awake. However, the second premise states that the mummy might not have been awake, which contradicts our initial assumption. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion that the vampire was not awake logically follows from the premises, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
