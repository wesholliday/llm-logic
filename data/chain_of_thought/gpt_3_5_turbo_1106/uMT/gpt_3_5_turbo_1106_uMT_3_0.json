The book is not a mystery novel.\n\nFrom the given information, we can infer that the book was not written by James. This is because if the book was written by James, it would have to be a mystery novel according to the first statement. However, the second statement tells us that the book is not a mystery novel, which contradicts the condition that the book would have to be a mystery novel if it was written by James.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
