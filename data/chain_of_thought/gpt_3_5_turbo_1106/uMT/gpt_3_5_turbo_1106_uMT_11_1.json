Also, the muffins were not blueberry. \n\nFrom the given information, we can deduce that:\n- If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n- The muffins were not blueberry.\n\nNow, if we assume the cake was chocolate, then according to statement 1, the muffins should be blueberry. However, statement 2 contradicts this assumption by stating that the muffins were not blueberry. \n\nSo, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
