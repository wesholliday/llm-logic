This is a negation of the consequent in the conditional statement.\n\nNow, let's use logical reasoning:\nIf the conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is true, and the negation of the consequent \"Bob did not choose pasta\" is also true, then we can infer that the antecedent \"Sue chose pizza\" must be false. This is based on the logical rule of modus tollens, which states that if the consequent of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent must also be false.\n\nSo, can we infer that Sue did not choose pizza?\nAnswer: yes",
