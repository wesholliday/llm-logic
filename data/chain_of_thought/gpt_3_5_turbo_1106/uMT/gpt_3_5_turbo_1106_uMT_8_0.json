The mummy was not awake.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake. However, the second statement tells us that the mummy was not awake.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\nIf the mummy was not awake, it does not necessarily mean that the vampire was not awake. It only means that the condition for the mummy being awake (if the vampire was awake) was not met. The vampire could still be awake for other reasons.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the vampire was not awake based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
