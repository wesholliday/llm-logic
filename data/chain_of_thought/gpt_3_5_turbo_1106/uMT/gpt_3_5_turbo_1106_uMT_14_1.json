This contradicts the initial implication from the first statement, which means that it can't be the case that the bear was in the cave.\n\nIt's important to recognize that the first statement sets up a conditional relationship between the bear and the wolf. In formal logic, if the antecedent is true (bear in cave), then the consequent must be true (wolf in den). If the consequent is false (wolf not in den), then the antecedent (bear in cave) must also be false.
