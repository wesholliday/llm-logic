Adding \"or tomorrow\" to this statement would imply that the delivery could also take place on the following day. However, this is not necessarily true based on the original statement alone. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The package must have been delivered today or tomorrow\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
