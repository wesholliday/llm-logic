However, it does not necessarily imply that the flight was rescheduled. It is possible that the flight was delayed and then departed at a later time without being rescheduled. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The flight must have been delayed or rescheduled\" from the statement \"The flight must have been delayed.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
