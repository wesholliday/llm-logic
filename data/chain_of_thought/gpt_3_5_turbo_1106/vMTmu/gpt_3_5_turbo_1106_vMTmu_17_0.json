From the first premise, if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\n3. But the second premise states that it's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad, which contradicts the first premise.\n4. Therefore, the assumption that Ben ate pasta leads to a contradiction.\n\nSince assuming the opposite of the conclusion leads to a contradiction, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
