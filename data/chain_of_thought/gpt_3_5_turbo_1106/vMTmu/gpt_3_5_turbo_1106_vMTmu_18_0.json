From the first premise, if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n3. But the second premise states that it's not the case that the truck must have been metal, which contradicts the assumption that the doll was plastic.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion that the doll was not plastic logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
