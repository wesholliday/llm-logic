If we assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false, we can derive a contradiction. \n\nAssuming the premises are true:\n1. If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n2. It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\n\nNow, let's assume the conclusion 'Sam did take a plane' is false. This means Sam did not take a plane.\n\nIf Sam did not take a plane, then the first premise 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train' does not provide any information about Erin's mode of transportation. Therefore, the second premise 'It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train' is irrelevant in this case.\n\nSince the premises do not logically lead to the conclusion, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
