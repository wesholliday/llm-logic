Assume the first premise 'If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball' is true.\n2. Assume the second premise 'It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball' is true.\n3. From the first premise, if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. But the second premise states that Jen did not watch basketball, which contradicts the first premise.\n4. Therefore, the assumption that Tom watched football leads to a contradiction, so it must be false.\n5. This means that the conclusion 'Tom did not watch football' follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
