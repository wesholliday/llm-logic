Then, according to the first premise, Mark must have bought the blue shirt. However, the second premise states that it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt, which contradicts our initial assumption. Therefore, if we assume the conclusion is false (i.e., Lisa did buy the red shirt), we arrive at a contradiction.\n\nThis means that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
