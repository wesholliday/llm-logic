If we assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false, we can check if this leads to a contradiction.\n\nAssume the bear was in the cave (P), and the wolf was not in the den (~Q). Then, according to the first premise, if P then Q, which means if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. But the second premise states that it's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den, which contradicts our assumption.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
