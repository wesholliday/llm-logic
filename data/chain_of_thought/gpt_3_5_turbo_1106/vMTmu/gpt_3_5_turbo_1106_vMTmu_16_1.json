This is because the first premise establishes a conditional relationship between the shirt being cotton and the pants being denim. If the condition for the consequent (pants being denim) is not met, then the antecedent (shirt being cotton) cannot be true.\n\nConclusion: 'The shirt was not cotton'\n\nBased on this analysis, the argument form is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",

This is an implication (if-then statement).\n- It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.
