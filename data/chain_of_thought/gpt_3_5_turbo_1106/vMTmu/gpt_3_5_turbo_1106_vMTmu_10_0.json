From the first premise, if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\n3. But the second premise states that it's not the case that the cat must have been outside.\n4. This contradicts the assumption that the dog was inside.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that the dog was not inside logically follows from the premises, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
