If J, then A\n2. \u00acA\nConclusion: \u00acJ\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus tollens, a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus tollens states that if a conditional statement (if P, then Q) is true and Q is false, then P must be false. Here, the conditional statement is 'If J, then A' and the conclusion drawn in the argument ('J did not play basketball') is consistent with the modus tollens form.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
