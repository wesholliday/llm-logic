If we assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false, we can check if this leads to a contradiction.\n\nAssuming the first premise \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\" is true, and the second premise \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim\" is also true, we can conclude that the conclusion \"The shirt was not cotton\" must be true to avoid a contradiction.\n\nThis means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true, which makes the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
