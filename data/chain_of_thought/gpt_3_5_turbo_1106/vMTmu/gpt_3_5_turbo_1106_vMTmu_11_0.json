Then, according to the first premise, the muffins must have been blueberry. However, the second premise states that it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry, which contradicts our initial assumption.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that the cake was not chocolate logically follows from the premises, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
