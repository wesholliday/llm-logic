This can be represented as A -> B, where A is \"the alien visited Mars\" and B is \"the robot visited Jupiter\".\n\nSecond premise: It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter. This can be represented as \u00acB, where \u00ac is the symbol for negation.\n\nConclusion: The alien did not visit Mars. This can be represented as \u00acA.\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\n1. If A -> B (If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter)\n2. \u00acB (It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter)\n3. \u00acA (The conclusion: The alien did not visit Mars)\n\nBy using the rules of implication and negation, we can see that if the first premise is true and the second premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
