Then, according to the first premise, the banana must have been yellow. However, the second premise states that it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow, which contradicts our initial assumption.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that the apple was not red logically follows from the premises, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
