            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can use the rules of inference. The argument is in the form of a modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, then we can conclude that P is also false. In this case, the first premise is a conditional statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\" and the second premise is the negation of the consequent \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel\". Therefore, the conclusion \"The book was not written by James\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
