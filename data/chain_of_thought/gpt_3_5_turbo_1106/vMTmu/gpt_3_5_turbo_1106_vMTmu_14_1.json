If we assume both premises are true, but the conclusion is false, then there must be a logical contradiction.\n\n1. Assume the bear was in the cave: If the bear was in the cave, then according to the first premise, the wolf must have been in the den. \n2. But the second premise states that it's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den.\n\nThis leads to a contradiction because if the bear was in the cave and the wolf must have been in the den, then the second premise directly contradicts this, indicating that the bear was not in the cave. This contradicts our assumption. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
