From the first premise, if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n3. But the second premise states that it's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta, which contradicts the first premise.\n4. Therefore, the assumption that Sue chose pizza leads to a contradiction.\n\nSince the assumption leads to a contradiction, the conclusion that Sue did not choose pizza logically follows.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
