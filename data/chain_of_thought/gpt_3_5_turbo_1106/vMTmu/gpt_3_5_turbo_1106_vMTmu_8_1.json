This can also be represented as 'not B -> not A' using the contrapositive rule.\n\nThe second premise is 'not B', which means \"it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake\".\n\nNow, we can use the contrapositive rule to derive 'not A' from premise 2 and premise 1. This means that if it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake (not B), then the vampire was not awake (not A).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion 'The vampire was not awake' logically follows from the premises and the rules of deductive reasoning.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
