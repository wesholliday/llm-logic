According to the first premise, if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. However, the second premise states that it's not the case that Amy must have played tennis. This contradicts the assumption that Jeff played basketball.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Jeff did not play basketball\" logically follows from the premises, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
