In this case, \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\" means that if the glip was slogged, then it was also tragged.\n\nGiven the second statement \"The glip was slogged\", we can conclude that the condition of the first statement is satisfied, so we can infer that \"The glip was tragged\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
