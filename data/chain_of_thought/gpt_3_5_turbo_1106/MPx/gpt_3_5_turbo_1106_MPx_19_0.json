Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we also have the premise \"P,\" then we can infer the conclusion \"Q.\" \n\nSo, in this case, we have the conditional statement \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\" and the premise \"The smonk was vreebled.\" \n\nNow, we can apply modus ponens to infer the conclusion \"The smonk plagged.\" \n\nAnswer: yes",
