It states that if the whiffle was shanked, then it tinked.\n\nNow, let's consider the inference \"The whiffle did not tink\" based on the given statements.\n\nGiven that the whiffle was not shanked, we cannot directly infer whether the whiffle tinked or not, as the second statement only provides information about what happens if the whiffle was shanked. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The whiffle did not tink\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
