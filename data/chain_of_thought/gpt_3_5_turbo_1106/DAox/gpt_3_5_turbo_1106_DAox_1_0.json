The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nSo, the contrapositive of \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled\" is \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nNow, combining the first statement with the contrapositive of the second statement, we can infer \"The flugel was not zargled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
