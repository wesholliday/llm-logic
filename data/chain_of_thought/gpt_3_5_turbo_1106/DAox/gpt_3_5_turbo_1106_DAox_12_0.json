It says that if the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.\n\nNow, let's analyze the inference:\n\nGiven the first statement, \"The smip was not shripped,\" we cannot directly infer anything about whether the smip lupped the zoint or not. This is because the second statement is conditional and does not provide any information about what happens if the smip was not shripped.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The smip did not lup the zoint\" from the given statements.",
