The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\" is \"If the smonk was not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled.\"\n\nSo, based on the given statements and the contrapositive of statement 2, can we infer \"The smonk was not plagged\"?",
