Then, from statement 2, if the sprocket was cranked, it would have been daggled. However, since we know the sprocket was not cranked, we cannot make any inference about whether it was daggled or not.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot infer \"The sprocket was not daggled.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
