From statement 2, we have a conditional statement: if the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\n\nNow, let's consider the inference we want to make: \"The wug did not bim the zoint.\"\n\nTo make this inference, we need to consider the contrapositive of the conditional statement in statement 2. The contrapositive of \"if p then q\" is \"if not q then not p.\"\n\nSo, the contrapositive of \"if the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint\" is \"if the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\"\n\nGiven that we know the wug did not floop (from statement 1), we can conclude that the wug did not bim the zoint.\n\nAnswer: yes",
