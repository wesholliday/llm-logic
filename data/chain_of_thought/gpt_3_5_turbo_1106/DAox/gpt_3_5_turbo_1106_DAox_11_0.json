If the antecedent (flug was blummed) is true, then the consequent (flug was zimmed) is also true.\n\nNow, let's consider the contrapositive of statement 2. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If p, then q\" is \"If not q, then not p\". In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\" is \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed\".\n\nSo, from the given information, we can infer \"The flug was not zimmed\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
