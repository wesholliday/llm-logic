In this case, the statement \"The plimp must be fribble\" does not necessarily imply \"The plimp must be fribble and zump.\" The original statement only asserts that the plimp must be fribble, but it does not provide any information about whether the plimp must also be zump. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The plimp must be fribble and zump\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
