            "content": "First, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. The first statement \"The griffin might not have been in the forest\" suggests that there is a possibility that the griffin was not in the forest. The second statement \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\" indicates that it is not necessary for the griffin to be in the forest.\n\nGiven the first statement, the possibility exists that the griffin was not in the forest. The second statement reinforces this by indicating that it is not a requirement for the griffin to be in the forest. Therefore, based on the logic, we can infer that the griffin is not necessarily in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
