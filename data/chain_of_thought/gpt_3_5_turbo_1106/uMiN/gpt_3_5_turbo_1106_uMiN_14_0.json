If the initial statement is \"The milk might not be on the counter,\" it means there is a possibility that the milk is not on the counter, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that it could still be on the counter. Therefore, we cannot infer that it's not the case that the milk must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: no",
