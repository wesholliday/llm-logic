Therefore, we cannot directly infer that the notebook must not be in the drawer from this statement.\n\nNow, the negation of \"The notebook might not be in the drawer\" would be \"It is not the case that the notebook might not be in the drawer.\" This is equivalent to \"It is the case that the notebook must be in the drawer.\" If the original statement is true, its negation would be false, and vice versa.\n\nSo, in summary, we cannot infer that it's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer from the statement \"The notebook might not be in the drawer.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
