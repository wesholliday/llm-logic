If something \"might not\" be the case, it doesn't necessarily mean that it \"must not\" be the case. It only indicates that there's a possibility it's not the case.\n\nSo, we can infer from \"The newspaper might not be in the driveway\" that it is not necessarily the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes",
