Assume the first premise 'Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge' is true.\n2. Assume the second premise 'The milk might not be chilling in the fridge' is true.\n3. Assume the conclusion 'The milk is on the counter' is false.\n\nIf we assume all of these statements are true, we can derive a contradiction. If the milk is not on the counter and it's not chilling in the fridge, then it would violate the first premise. Since the conclusion being false leads to a contradiction, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
