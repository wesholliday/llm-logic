This means that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack, according to the first premise. \n\nHowever, the second premise states that the scarf might not be draped on the coat rack, which contradicts our initial assumption. \n\nTherefore, the only remaining possibility is that the scarf is indeed stuffed in the backpack. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
