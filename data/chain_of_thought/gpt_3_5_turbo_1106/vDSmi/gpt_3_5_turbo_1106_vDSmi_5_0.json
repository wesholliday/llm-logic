The first premise presents a disjunction (either/or statement), and the second premise introduces a possibility. The conclusion then asserts a specific location for the cookies.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess whether the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion \"The cookies are in the jar\" does not necessarily follow from the premises. The possibility that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry does not logically entail that they must be in the jar.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
