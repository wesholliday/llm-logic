If we assume that both premises are true and the conclusion is false, we can check if it leads to a contradiction.\n\nAssuming the first premise \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" is true, and the second premise \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" is also true, we can conclude that the remote control is on the coffee table. \n\nThis is because if the remote control is not hiding under the couch, then it must be on the coffee table according to the first premise. Therefore, the conclusion is true based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
