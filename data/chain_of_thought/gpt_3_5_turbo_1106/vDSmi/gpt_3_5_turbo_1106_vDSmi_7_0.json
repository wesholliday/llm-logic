Then, according to the first premise, it must be tucked away in the closet. However, the second premise states that the umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet, which contradicts our initial assumption. \n\nTherefore, the only remaining possibility is that the umbrella is in the car. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
