The first premise states that either the pen is in the bag or it must be on the desk. The second premise states that the pen might not be on the desk. From these premises, we can logically conclude that the pen is in the bag, as it must be in one of the two locations. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
