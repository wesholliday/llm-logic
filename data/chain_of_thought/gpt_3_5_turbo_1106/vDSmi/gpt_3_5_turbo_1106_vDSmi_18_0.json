This means that the first premise 'Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand' must be true, and the notebook is not in the drawer. \n\nNow, if the notebook is not in the drawer, then the second premise 'The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand' must be false, because if it's not in the drawer, it must be on the nightstand according to the first premise. \n\nHowever, this leads to a contradiction, as both premises cannot be true at the same time. Therefore, the conclusion 'The notebook is in the drawer' must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
