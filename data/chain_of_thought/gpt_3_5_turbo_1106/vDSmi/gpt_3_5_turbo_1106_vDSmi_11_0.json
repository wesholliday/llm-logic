Then, according to the first premise, it must be sitting on the porch. However, the second premise states that the newspaper might not be sitting on the porch, which contradicts our assumption. \n\nTherefore, the only remaining possibility is that the newspaper is in the driveway. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
