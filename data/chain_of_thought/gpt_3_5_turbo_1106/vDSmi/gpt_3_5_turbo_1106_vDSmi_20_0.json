If we assume that the premises are true and the conclusion is false, we can check if this leads to a contradiction.\n\n1. Assume the first premise 'Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head' is true.\n2. Assume the second premise 'The sunglasses might not be perched on her head' is true.\n3. Assume the conclusion 'The sunglasses are in her bag' is false.\n\nIf the conclusion is false, then the first part of the disjunction in the first premise must be true, meaning the sunglasses must be perched on her head. However, this contradicts the second premise, which states that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head. Therefore, the conclusion must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
