If we assume that both premises are true and the conclusion is false, we can show that it leads to a contradiction.\n\n1. Assume the missing puzzle piece is not in the box and is not blending in on the floor.\n2. From the first premise, if the missing puzzle piece is not in the box, then it must be blending in on the floor.\n3. But the second premise states that the missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor, which contradicts our assumption.\n\nSince assuming the premises are true and the conclusion is false leads to a contradiction, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
