The second premise states that the toy might not be sitting on the shelf. From these premises, we cannot logically conclude that the toy must be in the toy box, as there is still the possibility that the toy is not in the toy box and not sitting on the shelf. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
