If we assume that both premises are true and the conclusion is false, we can check if that leads to a contradiction.\n\n1. Assume the cat is not napping on the couch.\n2. From the first premise, if the cat is not napping on the couch, then it must be playing in the bedroom.\n3. But the second premise states that the cat might not be playing in the bedroom, which contradicts the first premise.\n4. Therefore, the assumption that the cat is not napping on the couch leads to a contradiction.\n\nSince assuming the negation of the conclusion leads to a contradiction, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
