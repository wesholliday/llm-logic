If we assume that the premises are true and the conclusion is false, we can check if this leads to a contradiction.\n\n1. Assume the keys are not in the drawer.\n2. From the first premise, if the keys are not in the drawer, then they must be dangling in the cabinet.\n3. But the second premise states that the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet, which contradicts our assumption from the first premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
