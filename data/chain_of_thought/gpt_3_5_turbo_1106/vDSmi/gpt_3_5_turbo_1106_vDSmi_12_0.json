The first premise states that either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet. The second premise states that the jacket might not be hanging in the closet. From these premises, we can logically conclude that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nThis is because if it's not hanging in the closet, and the first premise tells us that it must be either draped over the chair or hanging in the closet, then the only remaining option is that it is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
