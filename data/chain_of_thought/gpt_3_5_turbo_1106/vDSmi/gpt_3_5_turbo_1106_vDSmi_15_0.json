If we assume that the premises are true and the conclusion is false, we can check if this leads to a contradiction.\n\n1. Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door (Premise)\n2. The shoes might not be lined up by the door (Premise)\n\nAssume for the sake of contradiction that the conclusion 'The shoes are in the closet' is false.\n\nIf the conclusion is false, then it must be the case that the shoes are not in the closet. This means the first premise 'Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door' must be true, and the shoes must be lined up by the door. However, this contradicts the second premise 'The shoes might not be lined up by the door'.\n\nSince assuming the conclusion to be false leads to a contradiction, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
