            "content": "To determine the logical validity of the argument, we can use the form of the argument known as modus tollens. Modus tollens has the following form:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, the premise \"The toy might not be in the toy box\" can be represented as \"It's not the case that the toy is in the toy box\" (not P), and the conclusion \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" can be represented as \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" (not Q).\n\nSo, the argument can be structured as follows:\n1. If the toy is in the toy box, then it must be in the toy box. (P \u2192 Q)\n2. It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box. (not Q)\n3. Therefore, it's not the case that the toy is in the toy box. (not P)\n\nNow, we can determine if the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
