The premise \"The vampire might not have been awake\" can be represented as \"It is possible that the vampire was not awake.\" The conclusion \"It's not the case that the vampire must have been awake\" can be represented as \"It is not necessary that the vampire was awake.\"\n\nThe argument can be symbolized as:\nPremise: \u00acNecessarily (Vampire was awake)\nConclusion: \u00acNecessarily (Vampire was awake)\n\nTo evaluate the validity of the argument, we can use the rule of inference called \"modus tollens,\" which states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, then we can conclude that P is false. In this case, the argument follows the form of modus tollens.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
