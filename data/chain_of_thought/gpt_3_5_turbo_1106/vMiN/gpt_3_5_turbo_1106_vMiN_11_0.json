If the premise \"The newspaper might not be in the driveway\" is true, then the conclusion \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway\" logically follows. This is because if something might not be the case, then it is not necessary that it must be the case. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
