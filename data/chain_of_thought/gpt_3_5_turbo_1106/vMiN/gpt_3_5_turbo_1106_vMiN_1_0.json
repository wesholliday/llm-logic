If the premise 'Mary might not have been at the wedding' is true, then the conclusion 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding' must also be true. This is because if there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding, then it cannot be the case that she must have been there. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
