If the premise 'The dog might not have been inside' is true, then the conclusion 'It's not the case that the dog must have been inside' must also be true. This is because if the dog might not have been inside, then it cannot be the case that the dog must have been inside. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
