If the premise 'Alex might not have finished the race' is true, then the conclusion 'It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race' logically follows. This is because if there is a possibility that Alex did not finish the race, then it cannot be the case that he must have finished the race. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
