If the premise \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\" is true, then the conclusion \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\" logically follows. This is because if there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then it is not necessary that she bought it. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
