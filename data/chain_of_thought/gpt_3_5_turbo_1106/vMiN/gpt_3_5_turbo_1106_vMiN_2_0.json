            "content": "To determine the logical validity of the argument, we can use the form of the argument known as modus tollens. Modus tollens has the following form:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn the given argument, the premise \"The griffin might not have been in the forest\" can be represented as \"It's not the case that the griffin was in the forest\" (not Q), and the conclusion \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\" can be represented as \"It's not the case that the griffin was in the forest\" (not P).\n\nSo, the argument can be represented as:\n\n1. If the griffin was in the forest, then it must have been in the forest.\n2. It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest.\n3. Therefore, it's not the case that the griffin was in the forest.\n\nNow, we can see that the argument follows the form of modus tollens, making it logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
