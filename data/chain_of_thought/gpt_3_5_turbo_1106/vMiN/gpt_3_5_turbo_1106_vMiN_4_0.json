The premise \"The alien might not have visited Mars\" can be symbolized as \u00ac(A), where A represents the statement \"The alien visited Mars.\" The conclusion \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars\" can be symbolized as \u00ac(A). \n\nNow, if the premise is \u00ac(A), then the conclusion \u00ac(A) follows directly from it. This is because if it is not the case that the alien visited Mars (\u00ac(A)), then it follows that it's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars (\u00ac(A)).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
