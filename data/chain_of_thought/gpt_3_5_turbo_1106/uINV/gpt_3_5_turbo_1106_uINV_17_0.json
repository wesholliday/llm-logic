The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"if p, then q\" is \"if not q, then not p.\" In this case, the contrapositive of \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" is \"If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\nSo, if we assume the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. This means that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad.\n\nAnswer: yes",
