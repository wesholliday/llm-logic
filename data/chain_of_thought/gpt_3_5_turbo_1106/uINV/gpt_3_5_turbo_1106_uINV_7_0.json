The contrapositive of \"if p, then q\" is \"if not q, then not p.\" In this case, the contrapositive would be \"if Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\nSo, if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. This means that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
