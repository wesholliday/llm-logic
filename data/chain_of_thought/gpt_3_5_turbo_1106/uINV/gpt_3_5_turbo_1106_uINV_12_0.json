            "content": "First, let's break down the original statement. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\" where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nNow, we want to determine if the inverse of the original statement is true. The inverse of \"P \u2192 Q\" is \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\" where \u00acP is \"Joe did not go to the park\" and \u00acQ is \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\"\n\nTo determine if the inverse is true, we need to consider if the original statement guarantees the truth of the inverse. In this case, the original statement does not guarantee the truth of the inverse. Just because Joe did not go to the park does not necessarily mean that Lucy did not go to the zoo. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo, unrelated to Joe going to the park.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: no",
