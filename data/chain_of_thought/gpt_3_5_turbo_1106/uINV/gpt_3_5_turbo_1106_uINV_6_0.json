The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"if p, then q\" is \"if not q, then not p.\"\n\nSo, the contrapositive of the original statement is: \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can we infer that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta?\"\n\nBased on the contrapositive of the original statement, we can infer that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
