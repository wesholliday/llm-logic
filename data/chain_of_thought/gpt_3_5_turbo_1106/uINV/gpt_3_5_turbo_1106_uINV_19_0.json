The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"if p, then q\" is \"if not q, then not p.\" In this case, the contrapositive of the original statement is \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nSo, if Tom did not watch football, according to the contrapositive, we can infer that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
