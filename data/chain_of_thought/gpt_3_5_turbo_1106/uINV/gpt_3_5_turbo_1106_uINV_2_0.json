The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"if A, then B\" is \"if not B, then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive of the original statement would be \"if the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nSo, if the griffin was not in the forest, we can infer from the contrapositive that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
