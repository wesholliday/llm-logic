The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"if p, then q\" is \"if not q, then not p.\" In this case, the contrapositive of \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n\nSo, if we consider the contrapositive, we can infer that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
