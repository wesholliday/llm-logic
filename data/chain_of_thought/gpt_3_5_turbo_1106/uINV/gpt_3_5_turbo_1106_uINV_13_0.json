            "content": "First, let's break down the original statement. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This means that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. However, it does not tell us anything about what happens if the car is not red.\n\nTo infer whether \"if the car was not red, then the truck was not blue,\" we can use the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing the order. In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\"\n\nSo, based on the contrapositive, if the truck was not blue, then the car was not red. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the car was not red, then the truck was not blue. This is because the original statement only tells us about the relationship between the car being red and the truck being blue, and does not provide information about what happens if the car is not red.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\n\nAnswer: no",
