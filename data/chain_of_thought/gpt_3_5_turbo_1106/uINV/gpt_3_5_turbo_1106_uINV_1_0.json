The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive of the original statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nSo, based on the contrapositive, if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
