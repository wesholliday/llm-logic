The original statement is: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be represented as \"Vampire \u2192 Mummy.\"\n\nNow, to determine if the inverse is true, we need to consider the statement \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acVampire \u2192 \u00acMummy.\"\n\nTo determine if the inverse is true, we need to consider the original statement and its inverse. In logic, the inverse of a statement is not necessarily equivalent to the original statement.\n\nSo, let's consider the possibility that the mummy could be awake for reasons other than the vampire being awake. For example, the mummy could be awake due to some other factor unrelated to the vampire's state.\n\nGiven this, we cannot infer that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
