This means \"It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door or they are in the closet.\"\n\nThen combine \u00acp \u2228 q with p \u2228 q using the Rule of Addition to get (\u00acp \u2228 q) \u2227 (p \u2228 q).\n\nBy the Distributive Property, this simplifies to (\u00acp \u2227 p) \u2228 (\u00acp \u2227 q) \u2228 (p \u2227 p) \u2228 (p \u2227 q).
