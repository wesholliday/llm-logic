Now we want to infer if the book is on the shelf, which is represented by Q.\n\nTo check if we can infer Q, we can use the following logic:\n- If \u00acP is true, then P must be false.\n- If P v Q is true, and P is false, then Q must be true.\n\nSo, considering the given statements:\n- If it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table, then the book is not on the table.\n- If the book is not on the table, but either it must be on the table or on the shelf, then it must be on the shelf.\n\nNow, we can answer the question!",

Now, if we substitute this into the combined statements:\n(B \u2227 \u00acT) \u2227 (B \u2228 S)\n\nLooking at this more closely, we can see that B \u2227 \u00acT can't both be true at the same time due to the law of non-contradiction. Therefore, one of them has to be false, meaning the book is either on the table or not. Since the second option is S (the book is on the shelf), and we've already determined that B \u2227 \u00acT can't both be true, it follows that the book must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
