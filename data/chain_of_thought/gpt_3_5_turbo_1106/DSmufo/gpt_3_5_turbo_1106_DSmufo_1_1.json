Apply the law of excluded middle, which states that for any proposition P, P \u2228 \u00acP is true. In this case, we have (Fido must be in the garden) \u2228 (Fido is inside), so we can conclude that Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside.\n2. Apply De Morgan's law to \u00ac(Fido must be in the garden) to get Fido is inside \u2228 (Fido is inside). This simplifies to Fido is inside.\n\nHaving gone through these logical steps, we can now provide an answer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
