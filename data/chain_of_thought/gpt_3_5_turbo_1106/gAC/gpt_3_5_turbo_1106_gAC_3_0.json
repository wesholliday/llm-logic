This means that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel.\n\nSecond, we are given that \"The book is a mystery novel\" is true.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can conclude that the book being a mystery novel does not necessarily mean that it was written by James. It could have been written by someone else and still be a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, it does not follow that \"The book was written by James\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
