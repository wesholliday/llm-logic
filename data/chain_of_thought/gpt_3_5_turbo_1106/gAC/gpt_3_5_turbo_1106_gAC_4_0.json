If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter (If A, then B)\n2. The robot visited Jupiter (B)\n\nWe want to determine if A is true.\n\nTo do this, we can use the concept of the contrapositive. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" So, if the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nSince the robot did visit Jupiter, we cannot conclude anything about the alien visiting Mars based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
