This means that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nSecond, we are given the statement \"Chris finished the race\" is true.\n\nNow, based on these two pieces of information, we can conclude that Alex may or may not have finished the race. The fact that Chris finished the race does not necessarily mean that Alex also finished the race. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"Alex finished the race\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
