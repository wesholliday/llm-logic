Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, then we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" and we know that \"The pants were denim\" is true. Therefore, we can use modus ponens to conclude that \"The shirt was cotton\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
