It tells us that if the fribble was snurgled, then it crinked.\n\nNow, let's use logical reasoning to determine if we can infer \"The fribble was not snurgled\" from the given information. \n\nIf the fribble did not crink, and the only condition for it to crinkle is being snurgled, then we can infer that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
