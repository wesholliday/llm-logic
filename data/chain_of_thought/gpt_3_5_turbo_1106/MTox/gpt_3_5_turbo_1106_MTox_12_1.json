It says, \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.\" This means if the smip was shripped (p), then the smip lupped the zoint (q). In logic, this can be represented as p \u2192 q.\n\nNow, to use modus tollens, we can assume the negation of q, which is \u00acq. From the implication p \u2192 q, if q is false (\u00acq), then p must also be false (\u00acp). This is the notion of modus tollens: if the consequence is false, then the condition is also false.\n\nSo, if the smip did not lup the zoint, it implies that the smip was not shripped.\n\nTherefore, the inference \"The smip was not shripped\" can be made.",
