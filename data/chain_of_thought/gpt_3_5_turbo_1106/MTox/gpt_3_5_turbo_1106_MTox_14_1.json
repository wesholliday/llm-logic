It says that if the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\n\nGiven these statements, we cannot infer whether the clug was fleeked or not. This is because the first statement does not give us information about whether the clug was fleeked or not. The second statement only tells us that if the clug was fleeked, then it snugged, but it does not tell us anything about whether the clug was actually fleeked or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
