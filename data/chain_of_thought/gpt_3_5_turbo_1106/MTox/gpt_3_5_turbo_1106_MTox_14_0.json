It tells us that if the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\n\nNow, let's use logical reasoning to determine if we can infer \"The clug was not fleeked\" from the given information. \n\nIf the clug did not snugged, it does not necessarily mean that the clug was not fleeked. The second statement only tells us what happens if the clug was fleeked, but it does not tell us anything about whether the clug was actually fleeked or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The clug was not fleeked\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
