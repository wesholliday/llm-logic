It can be rewritten as a logical implication: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"p \u2192 q\" where p is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and q is \"the dreb was spened.\"\n\nGiven the original statement \"The dreb was not spened,\" we can infer the negation of q, which is \"The dreb was not spened.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the contrapositive of the second statement. The contrapositive of \"p \u2192 q\" is \"\u00acq \u2192 \u00acp,\" which in this case would be \"The dreb was not spened \u2192 The dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nSo, based on the given information and the contrapositive of the second statement, we can infer \"The dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
