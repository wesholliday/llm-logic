From the second statement, we know that if the whiffle was shanked, then it tinked.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\nIf the whiffle did not tink, it could be because it was not shanked (based on the second statement). However, it could also be for other reasons not mentioned in the given information.\n\nGiven this, we cannot definitively infer \"The whiffle was not shanked\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
