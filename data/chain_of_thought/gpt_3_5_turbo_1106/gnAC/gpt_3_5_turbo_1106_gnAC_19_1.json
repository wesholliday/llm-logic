The statement \"If P, then Q\" is a conditional statement, and the form \"P implies Q\" is used in propositional logic. \n\nGiven the true conditional statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" (P implies Q), and the true statement \"Jen watched basketball\" (Q), we need to determine if it necessarily follows that \"Tom watched football\" (P).\n\nWhen the conclusion of a conditional statement is true, it does not necessarily imply that the antecedent is also true. This means that just because Q is true, P does not have to be true.\n\nWe can't infer from the given information whether Tom watched football. It's possible that Tom watched football, or it's possible that he did not.
