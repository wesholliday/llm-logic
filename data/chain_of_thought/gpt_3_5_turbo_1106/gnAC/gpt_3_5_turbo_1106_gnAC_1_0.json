To do this, we can use the concept of the contrapositive. The contrapositive of the statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nGiven that \"Sue was at the wedding\" is true, we can conclude that \"Sue was not not at the wedding\" (i.e., Sue was at the wedding). Therefore, based on the contrapositive, we can conclude that \"Mary was not not at the wedding\" (i.e., Mary was at the wedding).\n\nSo, based on the given information and the concept of the contrapositive, it necessarily follows that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
