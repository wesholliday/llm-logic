Then, we are given the statement \"The pants were denim\" is true. \n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot conclude that \"The shirt was cotton\" is true. This is because the first statement only tells us about the relationship between the shirt and the pants, but it does not tell us anything about the pants being denim. Therefore, we cannot make a definite conclusion about the shirt based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
