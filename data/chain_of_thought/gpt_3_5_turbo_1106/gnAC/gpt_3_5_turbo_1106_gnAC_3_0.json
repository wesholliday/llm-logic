This is represented as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nWe are also given that \"The book is a mystery novel,\" which means Q is true.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot conclude that \"The book was written by James\" is true. This is because the statement \"If P, then Q\" does not necessarily mean \"If Q, then P.\" Just because the book is a mystery novel (Q) does not mean it was necessarily written by James (P).\n\nAnswer: no",
