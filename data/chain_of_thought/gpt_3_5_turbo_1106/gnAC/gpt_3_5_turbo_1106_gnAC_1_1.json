            "content": "First, we need to understand that the statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is an implication. In symbolic logic, this implication is denoted as p -> q, where p is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nGiven that we have the implication \"p -> q\" and the statement q (Sue was at the wedding), we want to determine if it necessarily follows that p (Mary was at the wedding).\n\nWhen an implication \"p -> q\" is true and the consequent q is true, it does not guarantee that the antecedent p is true. This is because the implication holds even if p is false, as long as q is true. So, in this case, knowing that Sue was at the wedding does not necessarily imply that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"Mary was at the wedding\" does not necessarily follow from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
