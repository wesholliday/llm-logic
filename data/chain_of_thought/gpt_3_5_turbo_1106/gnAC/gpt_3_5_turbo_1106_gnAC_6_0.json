This means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. \n\nWe are also given the statement \"Bob chose pasta\" is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if it necessarily follows that \"Sue chose pizza\" is true based on the given information.\n\nTo do this, we can use the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive of \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\nSo, if Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza. However, we are given that Bob chose pasta, so we cannot conclude anything about Sue's choice based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
