Then, we are given the information that \"Kate ate salad\" is true. \n\nNow, we need to determine if it necessarily follows that \"Ben ate pasta\" is true based on the given information. \n\nTo do this, we can use the concept of logical implication. If the first statement is true and the second statement is true, then the implication holds and the conclusion is necessarily true. \n\nSo, based on the given information, does it necessarily follow that \"Ben ate pasta\" is true?",
