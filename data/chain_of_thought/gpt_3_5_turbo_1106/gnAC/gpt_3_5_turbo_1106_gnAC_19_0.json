This means that the second part of the conditional statement is true.\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude anything about whether the first part of the conditional statement (\"Tom watched football\") is true based solely on the fact that the second part is true. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if the first part is true, but it doesn't tell us anything about what happens if the first part is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot necessarily conclude that \"Tom watched football\" is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
