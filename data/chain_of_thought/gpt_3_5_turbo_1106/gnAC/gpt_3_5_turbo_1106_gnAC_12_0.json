This means that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nSecond, we are given the information that \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if it necessarily follows that \"Joe went to the park\" is true based on the given information.\n\nTo do this, we can use the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive of \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nSo, if Lucy went to the zoo, then it follows that Joe went to the park. \n\nAnswer: yes",
