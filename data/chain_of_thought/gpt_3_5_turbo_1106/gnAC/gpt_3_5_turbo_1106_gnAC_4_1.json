B (The robot visited Jupiter) - True\n\nTo determine if the alien visited Mars, we need to check if the statement \"A -> B\" and \"B\" being true entails that \"A\" is true. In other words, we want to see if \"A -> B\" and \"B\" being true necessitates \"A\" to be true.\n\nIf A -> B is true, then there are two cases to consider:\n- If A is true, then B must be true.\n- If B is false, then A can be either true or false.\n\nSince in this case B is true, we don't have enough information to determine the truth value of A.
