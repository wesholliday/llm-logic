This means that whenever the vampire is awake, the mummy is also awake. \n\nGiven that \"The mummy was awake\" is true, we cannot conclude whether the vampire was awake or not. The statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" does not tell us anything about the vampire's state when the mummy is awake. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the vampire was awake based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
