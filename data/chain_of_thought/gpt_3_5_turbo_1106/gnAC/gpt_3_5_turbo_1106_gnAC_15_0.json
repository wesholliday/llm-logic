The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive of \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\nSince we know that Erin took a train, the contrapositive tells us that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it does not necessarily follow that Sam took a plane.",
