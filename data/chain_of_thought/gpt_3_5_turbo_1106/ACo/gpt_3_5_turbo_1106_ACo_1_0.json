Then, we have the statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This is a conditional statement, and the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. So, the contrapositive of \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\" \n\nGiven that Sue was at the wedding, we can conclude that Mary was at the wedding based on the contrapositive of the conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
