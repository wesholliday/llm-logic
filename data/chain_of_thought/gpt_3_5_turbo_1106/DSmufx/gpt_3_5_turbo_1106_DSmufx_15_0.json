It's not the case that the dreb must be spened.\n\nNow, let's use the rule of inference called modus tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know \"not Q\", then we can infer \"not P\".\n\nSo, if we rewrite the first statement as a conditional statement, we get \"If the dreb must be spened, then it is vroombed\". Then, using modus tollens with the second statement \"It's not the case that the dreb must be spened\", we can infer \"It is not the case that the dreb is vroombed\".\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The dreb is not vroombed\" from the given statements.",
