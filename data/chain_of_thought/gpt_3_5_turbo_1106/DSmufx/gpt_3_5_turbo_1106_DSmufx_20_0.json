So, it could be the case that the fleeg is surned, or it could be bluttered, or both.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned.\" This means that the fleeg is not surned.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered.\" This is because the first statement allows for the possibility that the fleeg is bluttered without the need for it to be surned. Therefore, we cannot make the inference that the fleeg is bluttered based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
