Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement \"if P then Q\" and we know that Q is false, then we can infer that P is also false.\n\nGiven the statements:\n1. Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked.\n2. It's not the case that the shank must be nugged.\n\nWe can infer:\n3. The shank is plooked.\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer that if it's not the case that the shank must be nugged, then the shank must be plooked. Therefore, we can infer that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
