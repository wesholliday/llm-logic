(not A)\n\nNow, we can use the rule of inference called disjunctive syllogism, which states that if we have a disjunction (A or B) and the negation of one of the disjuncts (not A), then we can infer the other disjunct (B).\n\nSo, applying the disjunctive syllogism:\n- From (A or B) and not A, we can infer B.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The smip is shripped'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
