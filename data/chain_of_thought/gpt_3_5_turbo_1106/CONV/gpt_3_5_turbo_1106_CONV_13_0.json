The converse of a conditional statement switches the hypothesis and the conclusion. In this case, the converse would be \"If the truck was blue, then the car was red.\"\n\nTo determine if the converse is true, we need to consider whether the original statement guarantees the truth of the converse. In this case, the original statement does not guarantee the truth of the converse. Just because the truck was blue does not necessarily mean that the car was red.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the truck was blue, then the car was red\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
