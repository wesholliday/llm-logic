The contrapositive of a statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\" \n\nSo, if we can infer the contrapositive statement from the original statement, then we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nNow, let's check if we can infer the contrapositive statement from the original statement. In this case, it seems that we cannot infer the contrapositive statement from the original statement, as there could be other authors who write mystery novels. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no",
