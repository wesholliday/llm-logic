The contrapositive of \"if p, then q\" is \"if not q, then not p.\"\n\nSo, the contrapositive of the original statement is \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nNow, let's consider if the contrapositive statement is true based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
