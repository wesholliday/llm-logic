The contrapositive of \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\" \n\nNow, let's compare the original statement with its contrapositive. If the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. \n\nSo, if the original statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is true, then the contrapositive \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\" is also true. \n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
