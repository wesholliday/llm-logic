The original statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is in the form of a conditional statement: If P, then Q.\n\nTo infer the second statement \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red\" from the original statement, we need to check if the original statement implies the converse of the original conditional statement. The converse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If Q, then P\".\n\nIn this case, the original statement does not necessarily imply the converse. Just because the apple being red implies the banana being yellow, it does not necessarily mean that the banana being yellow implies the apple being red. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
