The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" is \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\"\n\nSo, the contrapositive statement is not the same as the statement we want to infer. Therefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
