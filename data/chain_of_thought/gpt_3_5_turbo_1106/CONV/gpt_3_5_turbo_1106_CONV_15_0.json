The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is a conditional statement in the form \"if P, then Q.\" This means that if the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the inverse of the original statement: \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane.\" This is the inverse of the original conditional statement. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
