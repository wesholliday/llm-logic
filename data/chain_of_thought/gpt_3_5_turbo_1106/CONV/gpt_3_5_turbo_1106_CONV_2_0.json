The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"if p, then q\" is \"if not q, then not p.\" In this case, the contrapositive of the original statement is \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\" \n\nSo, to determine if we can infer the statement \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest,\" we need to check if the contrapositive holds true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
