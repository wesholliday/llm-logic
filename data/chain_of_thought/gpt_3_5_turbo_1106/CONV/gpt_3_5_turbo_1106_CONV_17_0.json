The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"if p, then q\" is \"if not q, then not p.\"\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the original statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" is \"If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\nNow, let's compare the original statement with its contrapositive. If the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
