The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den\" is \"If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the case.\" \n\nSo, if we can infer the contrapositive statement, then we can infer \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
