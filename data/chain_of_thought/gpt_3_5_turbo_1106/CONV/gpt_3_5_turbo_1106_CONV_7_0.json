The converse of \"if p, then q\" is \"if q, then p.\"\n\nIn this case, the converse of the original statement would be \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race.\"\n\nNow, let's consider whether the original statement and its converse are logically equivalent. In other words, if the original statement is true, does it necessarily mean that its converse is also true?\n\nAnswer: no",
