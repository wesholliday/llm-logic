The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" \n\nSo, the contrapositive of \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" is \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside.\" \n\nNow, let's analyze the original statement and its contrapositive to see if we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nOriginal statement: If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\nContrapositive: If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside.\n\nBy comparing the original statement and its contrapositive, we can see that they are not equivalent. The original statement does not necessarily imply the contrapositive, as there could be other reasons for the cat to be outside or the dog to be inside. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
