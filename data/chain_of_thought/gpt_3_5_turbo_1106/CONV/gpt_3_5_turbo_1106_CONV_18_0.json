The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\" \n\nNow, let's consider the contrapositive statement: \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\" This statement is not the same as \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.\" Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
