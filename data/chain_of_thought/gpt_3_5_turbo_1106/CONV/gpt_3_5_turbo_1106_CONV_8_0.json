The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake\". \n\nSo, based on the contrapositive, we can infer that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
