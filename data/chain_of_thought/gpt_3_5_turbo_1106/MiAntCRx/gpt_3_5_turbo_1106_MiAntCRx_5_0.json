However, we cannot infer that the flimble might be both wobble and grooble based solely on the original statement. The original statement only provides information about the possibility of the flimble being grooble, and does not mention anything about wobble. Therefore, we cannot infer the combination of wobble and grooble from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
