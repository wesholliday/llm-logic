However, we cannot infer that the glorp might be shimble and bimboozle from this statement alone. The original statement does not provide any information about the relationship between shimble and bimboozle, so we cannot make any conclusions about the glorp being both shimble and bimboozle based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
