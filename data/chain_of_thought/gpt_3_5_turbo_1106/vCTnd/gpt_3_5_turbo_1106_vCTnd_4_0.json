If we assume the premise is true (Ben studied -> \u00ac(Ben studied diligently)), and then we also assume the conclusion is false (Ben studied diligently and Ben studied), it should not lead to a contradiction.\n\nLet's consider the case where Ben studied diligently (Ben studied diligently is true) and Ben studied (Ben studied is true). In this case, the premise \"If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently\" is false, and the conclusion \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study\" is also false. This means that the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise, and the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
