            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze it using the rules of logical implication. The premise \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice\" can be represented as A -> ~B, where A stands for \"advice was offered\" and ~B stands for \"not helpful advice.\" The conclusion \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered\" can be represented as B -> ~A, where B stands for \"helpful advice\" and ~A stands for \"advice was not offered.\"\n\nNow, let's check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. If we assume the premise \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice\" (A -> ~B) to be true, and then we also assume the conclusion \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered\" (B -> ~A) to be false, we can find a counterexample where the premise is true but the conclusion is false. \n\nFor example, if we have A as true (advice was offered) and B as true (helpful advice was offered), then the premise A -> ~B is false (since advice was offered and it was helpful), and the conclusion B -> ~A is also false (since helpful advice was offered but advice was also offered). This counterexample shows that the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise, making the argument invalid.\n\nTherefore, the form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
