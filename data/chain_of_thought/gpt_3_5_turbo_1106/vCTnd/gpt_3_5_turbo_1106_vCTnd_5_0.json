            "content": "To determine the logical validity of the argument, we can analyze it using the form of a hypothetical syllogism. The premise \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly\" can be represented as P \u2192 Q, and the conclusion \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\" can be represented as Q \u2192 R.\n\nNow, if we combine these two statements, we get the following syllogism:\nP \u2192 Q\nQ \u2192 R\nTherefore, P \u2192 R\n\nThis form of argument is known as the hypothetical syllogism, and it is logically valid. It states that if P implies Q, and Q implies R, then P implies R. This means that if the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly, and if it was not cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
