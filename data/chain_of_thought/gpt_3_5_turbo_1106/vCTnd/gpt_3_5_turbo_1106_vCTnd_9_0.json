The premise \"If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly\" can be represented as P -> Q, where P is \"instructions were given\" and Q is \"instructions were not explained clearly.\" The conclusion \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given\" can be represented as Q -> ~P, where ~P is \"instructions were not given.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n1. If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly (P -> Q)\n2. If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given (Q -> ~P)\n\nBy chaining these two conditional statements together, we get:\n3. If instructions were given, then instructions were not given (P -> ~P)\n\nThis argument is not logically valid because it leads to a contradiction. If instructions were given, it cannot be the case that instructions were not given. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
