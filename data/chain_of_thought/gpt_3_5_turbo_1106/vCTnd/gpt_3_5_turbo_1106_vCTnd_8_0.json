The premise \"If the issue was addressed, then it was not addressed effectively\" can be represented as P -> \u00acQ, where P is \"the issue was addressed\" and Q is \"the issue was addressed effectively\". The conclusion \"If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed\" can be represented as Q -> \u00acP.\n\nNow, let's check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. If P -> \u00acQ is true, and we also have Q -> \u00acP, then the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
