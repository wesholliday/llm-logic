For the given argument to be logically valid, the conclusion must follow from the premise. This means that if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nGiven p \u2192 \u00acq (the premise) and q \u2192 \u00acp (the conclusion), we can observe that these two conditional statements form a logical fallacy known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent. In formal logic, this fallacy occurs when the conclusion of a conditional statement is assumed to be false because the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional statement is false.\n\nIn the given argument, the form is not logically valid because it commits the fallacy of denying the antecedent. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
