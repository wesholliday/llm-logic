The premise \"If the meal was prepared, then it was not prepared carefully\" can be represented as P \u2192 \u00acQ, and the conclusion \"If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared\" can be represented as Q \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nNow, let's check if the argument is logically valid by using the hypothetical syllogism form: If P \u2192 \u00acQ and Q \u2192 \u00acP, then the valid conclusion should be P \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nAnswer: no",
