(p \u2192 \u00acq)\nConclusion: If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal. (q \u2192 \u00acp)\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument using the hypothetical syllogism:\n\nPremise: If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal. (p \u2192 \u00acq)\nPremise: If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal. (q \u2192 \u00acp)\n\nUsing the hypothetical syllogism, we can combine the premises to form the conclusion:\n\nIf I ate a meal (p), then I did not eat a large meal (\u00acq).\nIf I did not eat a large meal (\u00acq), then I ate a meal (p).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
