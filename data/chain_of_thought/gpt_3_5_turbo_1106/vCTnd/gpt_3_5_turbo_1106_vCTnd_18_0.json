The premise \"If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth\" can be represented as P \u2192 \u00acQ, where P stands for \"the issue was discussed\" and Q stands for \"the issue was discussed in depth.\" The conclusion \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed\" can be represented as Q \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\nPremise: P \u2192 \u00acQ\nConclusion: Q \u2192 \u00acP\n\nTo check the logical validity, we can use the hypothetical syllogism form: If P \u2192 Q and Q \u2192 R, then P \u2192 R.\n\nIn this case, the argument can be represented as:\nP \u2192 \u00acQ (Premise)\nQ \u2192 \u00acP (Conclusion)\n\nUsing the hypothetical syllogism form, we can combine the premise and conclusion to form:\nP \u2192 \u00acQ\nQ \u2192 \u00acP\nTherefore, P \u2192 \u00acP\n\nNow, let's analyze the combined statement P \u2192 \u00acP. This statement is a logical contradiction, as it asserts that if the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed, which is inherently contradictory.\n\nBased on this analysis, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
