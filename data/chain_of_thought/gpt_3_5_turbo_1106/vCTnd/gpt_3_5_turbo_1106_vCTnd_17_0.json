The premise \"If the customer was greeted, then they were not greeted warmly\" can be represented as P -> Q, and the conclusion \"If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted\" can be represented as Q -> R.\n\nNow, if we combine these two conditional statements, we get the following chain: P -> Q, Q -> R. This forms a valid hypothetical syllogism, where if P implies Q and Q implies R, then P implies R.\n\nSo, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
