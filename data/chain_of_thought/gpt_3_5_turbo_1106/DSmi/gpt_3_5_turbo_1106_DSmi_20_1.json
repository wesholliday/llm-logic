In this case, the disjunction \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" would lead us to conclude that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nNow, if the sunglasses are indeed perched on her head, the disjunction \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" would still be true.\n\nSo, in either case, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
