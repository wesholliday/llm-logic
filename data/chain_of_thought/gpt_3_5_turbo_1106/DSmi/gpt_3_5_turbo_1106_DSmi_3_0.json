From statement 2, we know that it's possible that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can't definitively infer that the keys are in the drawer, as they could still be in the cabinet. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The keys are in the drawer\" from the given statements.",
