The first statement, \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge,\" indicates that the milk is in one of two places: either on the counter or chilling in the fridge.\n\n2. The second statement, \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge,\" suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not chilling in the fridge.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can conclude that if the milk is not chilling in the fridge based on the second statement and it must be in one of two places mentioned in the first statement, then it must be on the counter. Therefore, we can infer that \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
