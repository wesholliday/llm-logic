In a conditional statement of the form \"if A then B\", if we know that B is true, we cannot necessarily infer that A is true. In this case, we know that \"quank quork\" is true, but we cannot infer that \"The wump must be quank on zibber\" is true based on the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
