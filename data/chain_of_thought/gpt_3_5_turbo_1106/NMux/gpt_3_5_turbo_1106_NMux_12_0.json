The original statement \"It's not the case that the smip must have been shripped\" can be rewritten as \"It's not necessarily true that the smip must have been shripped.\" This means that the possibility exists that the smip was not shripped. Therefore, we can infer \"The smip might not have been shripped\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
