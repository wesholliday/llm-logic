The original statement \"It's not the case that the clug must have been fleeked\" can be rewritten as \"It's not necessary that the clug has been fleeked.\" This can be further rewritten as \"It's possible that the clug has not been fleeked.\" Therefore, we can infer \"The clug might not have been fleeked\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
