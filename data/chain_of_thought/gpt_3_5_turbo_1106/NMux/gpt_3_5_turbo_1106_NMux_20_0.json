The original statement \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered\" can be rewritten as \"It's not necessarily true that the fleeg has been bluttered.\" This means that the possibility exists that the fleeg has not been bluttered. Therefore, we can infer \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
