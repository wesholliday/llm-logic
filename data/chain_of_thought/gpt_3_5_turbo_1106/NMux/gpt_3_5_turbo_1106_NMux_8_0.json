The original statement \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been cranked\" can be rewritten as \"It's not necessary that the sprocket has been cranked\". This can be further rewritten as \"It's possible that the sprocket has not been cranked\". Therefore, we can infer \"The sprocket might not have been cranked\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
