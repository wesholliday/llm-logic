The original statement \"It's not the case that the grommet must have been sploffed\" can be rewritten as \"It's not necessary that the grommet has been sploffed.\" This can be further rewritten as \"It's possible that the grommet has not been sploffed.\" Therefore, we can infer \"The grommet might not have been sploffed\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
