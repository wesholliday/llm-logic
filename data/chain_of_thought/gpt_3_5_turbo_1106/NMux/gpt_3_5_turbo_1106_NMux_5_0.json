The original statement \"It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled\" can be rewritten as \"It's not necessary that the zinger has been fraggled.\" This can be further simplified to \"It's possible that the zinger has not been fraggled.\" Therefore, we can infer \"The zinger might not have been fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
