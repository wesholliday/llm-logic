(not B)\n\nNow, let's use the rule of inference called disjunctive syllogism:\nIf we have a disjunction (A or B) and the negation of one of the disjuncts (not B), then we can infer the other disjunct (A).\n\nSo, applying the disjunctive syllogism to the given statements, we can infer 'The sneg is crampled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
