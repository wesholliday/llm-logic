Let S represent \"the wug is sproinged\"\n2. Let G represent \"the wug must be garpled\"\n\nThe given statements can be represented as:\n1. S v G (Either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled)\n2. ~G (It's not the case that the wug must be garpled)\n\nNow, we want to infer \"The wug is sproinged\" from the given statements.\n\nTo do this, we can use the rule of disjunctive syllogism, which states that if we have a disjunction (A v B) and the negation of one of the disjuncts (~B), then we can infer the other disjunct (A).\n\nSo, applying the disjunctive syllogism to the given statements, we can infer \"The wug is sproinged\" if the rule is applicable.\n\nNow, let's determine if the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
