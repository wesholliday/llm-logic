(not B)\n\nNow, we can use the rule of inference called disjunctive syllogism, which states that if we have a disjunction (A or B) and the negation of one of the disjuncts (not B), then we can infer the other disjunct (A).\n\nUsing this rule, we can infer 'The dreb is vroombed' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
