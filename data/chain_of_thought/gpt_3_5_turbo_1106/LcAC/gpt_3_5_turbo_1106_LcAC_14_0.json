Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"if p, then q\" and we also have p, then we can logically conclude q.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" and we have the statement \"The wolf was in the den.\" Therefore, we can use modus ponens to conclude that \"The bear was in the cave.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
