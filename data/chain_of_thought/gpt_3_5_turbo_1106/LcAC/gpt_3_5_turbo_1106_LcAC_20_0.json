However, we cannot conclude that the apple was red based solely on this information. The conditional statement \"If A, then B\" does not necessarily mean that if B is true, then A must also be true. There could be other reasons for the banana being yellow.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude \"The apple was red\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
