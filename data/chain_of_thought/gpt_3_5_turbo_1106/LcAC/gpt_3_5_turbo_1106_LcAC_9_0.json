It only establishes a relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt.\n\nNow, if we add the statement \"Mark bought the blue shirt,\" we can conclude that the second part of the conditional statement is true. However, this does not necessarily mean that the first part of the conditional statement is true. It's possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt even though Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
