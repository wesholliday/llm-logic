It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these statements. If the mummy must have been awake, then the vampire must have been awake. However, the second statement tells us that it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake. This means that the mummy could have been awake or not awake.\n\nGiven this information, we cannot definitively infer whether the vampire was awake or not. The information provided does not allow us to make a conclusive inference about the state of the vampire.\n\nAnswer: no",
