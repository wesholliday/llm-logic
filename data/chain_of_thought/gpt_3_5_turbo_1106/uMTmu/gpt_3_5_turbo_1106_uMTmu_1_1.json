This is equivalent to \"P implies Q\" or \"P \u2192 Q.\"\nThis is also given: It's not the case that Q. This is equivalent to \"not Q\" or \"\u00acQ.\"\n\nNow, we have P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ.\n\nNow we use the rule of Modus Tollens, which says if we have P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, we can infer \u00acP.\nThis gives us the conclusion: \u00acP, meaning Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nNow let's reason step by step. \n\nFirst, if Mary was at the wedding (P), then Sue must have been at the wedding (Q). This can be represented as P \u2192 Q.\n\nSecond, it is given that it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding, which can be represented as \u00acQ.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use Modus Tollens to conclude \u00acP, meaning Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
