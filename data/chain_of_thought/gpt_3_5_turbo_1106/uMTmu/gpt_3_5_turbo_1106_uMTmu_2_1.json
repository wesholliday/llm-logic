The second part \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest\" is the negation of the consequent of the premise.\n\nTo infer that the griffin was not in the forest, we need to use modus tollens on the original premise, which goes as follows: \"If p then q\" and \"not q,\" therefore \"not p.\"\n\nThe original premise is in the form \"If p then q\", with p being the griffin in the forest and q being the unicorn in the forest. Since the negation of q is given, we can use modus tollens to infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",

Let's analyze them step by step.\n\nStatement 1: If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\nThis is a conditional statement. The form of a conditional statement is \"if A, then B.\" In this case, A is \"the griffin was in the forest\" and B is \"the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" \n\nStatement 2: It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\nThis statement is the negation of B in the conditional statement.\n\nNow, let's think about the logical relationship between these two statements. The first statement tells us a condition under which the second statement must be true. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.
