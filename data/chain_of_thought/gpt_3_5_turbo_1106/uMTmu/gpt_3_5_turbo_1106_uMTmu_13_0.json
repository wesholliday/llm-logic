It's not the case that the truck must have been blue. (Negation of the previous statement)\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. This means that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. However, this doesn't tell us anything about the actual color of the car or the truck.\n- It's not the case that the truck must have been blue. This statement negates the previous conditional statement, so it tells us that the truck doesn't have to be blue.\n\nGiven this information, we cannot infer that the car was not red. The given information doesn't provide any direct evidence about the color of the car. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about the color of the car based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
