It means that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim.\n\nThe second part of the statement \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim\" is a negation of the previous statement. This is equivalent to saying \"It's not true that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\"\n\nCombining both parts, it means that it's not true that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. This leaves room for the possibility that the shirt was cotton without the pants being denim.\n\nNow let's address the question: \"Can we infer that the shirt was not cotton?\"\n\nAnswer: no",
