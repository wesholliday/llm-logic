This means that if the antecedent (the apple being red) is true, then the consequent (the banana being yellow) must also be true. However, if the antecedent is false, we cannot infer anything about the consequent.\n\nThe second statement \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow\" introduces a negation, indicating that the banana was not necessarily yellow.\n\nGiven these statements, we cannot directly infer whether the apple was not red. The original conditional statement does not give us information about the actual color of the apple, and the negation of the second statement does not provide us with enough information to determine the color of the apple.\n\nAnswer: no",
