It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta. This is a negation of the previous statement.\n\nNow, let's consider the inference:\nGiven the information, we cannot directly infer that Sue did not choose pizza. The negation of the statement \"Bob must have chosen pasta\" does not necessarily mean that Sue did not choose pizza. It only tells us that Bob's choice is not necessarily pasta. Therefore, we cannot infer Sue's choice based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
