This can be represented as \u00acQ.\n\nSo, we have the original statement P -> Q and the negation of the conclusion \u00acQ.\n\nNow, if we have P -> Q and \u00acQ, we can use the rule of modus tollens to infer \u00acP. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement P -> Q and the negation of the consequent \u00acQ, then we can infer the negation of the antecedent \u00acP.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer \"The book was not written by James\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
