The first statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This is a conditional statement. The next statement is \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\" This is a negation of the second part of the conditional statement.\n\nNow, based on these two statements, we are asked if we can infer \"The apple was not red.\" To make this inference, we can use the contrapositive of the original conditional statement. The contrapositive of \"If p then q\" is \"If not q, then not p.\"\n\nGiven that the negation of \"The banana must have been yellow\" is \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow,\" we can infer \"The apple was not red\" only if we assume the contrapositive of the original conditional statement. \n\nAnswer: Yes",

If we let A represent \"the apple was red\" and B represent \"the banana was yellow\", the original statement can be translated to \"If A, then B\" or A -> B.

The contrapositive of A -> B is \u00acB -> \u00acA, which states that if B is false, then A is false. \n\nSo, when we consider the contrapositive with the negation of B, we can indeed infer that \"The apple was not red\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
