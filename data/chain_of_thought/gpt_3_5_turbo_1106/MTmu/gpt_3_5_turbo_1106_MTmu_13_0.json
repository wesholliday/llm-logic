Let's represent \"the car was red\" as C and \"the truck must have been blue\" as T. So the original statement becomes \"If C, then T.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\" This can be represented as \u00acT.\n\nWe want to infer \"The car was not red,\" which can be represented as \u00acC.\n\nTo infer \u00acC from the given statements, we can use the contrapositive of the original statement \"If C, then T,\" which is \"If \u00acT, then \u00acC.\"\n\nSo, if we can show that \u00acT is true, then we can infer that \u00acC is true.\n\nNow, let's see if we can infer \u00acT from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
