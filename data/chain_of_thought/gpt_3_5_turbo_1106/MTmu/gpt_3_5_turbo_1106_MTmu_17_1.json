The first statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad\" can be represented as \"Ben ate pasta -> Kate ate the salad.\" The second statement \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad\" can be represented as \"~Kate ate the salad.\"\n\nGiven these two premises, we can infer that \"Ben did not eat pasta\" based on the logical rule of contraposition. The contrapositive of the first statement is \"Not Kate ate the salad -> Not Ben ate pasta.\" Since we know that \"Not Kate ate the salad\" is true, we can infer that \"Not Ben ate pasta\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
