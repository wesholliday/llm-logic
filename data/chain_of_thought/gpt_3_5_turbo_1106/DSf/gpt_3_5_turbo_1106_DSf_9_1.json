There could be other places where the puzzle piece might be located. Therefore, we cannot directly infer \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box\" from the given statements.\n\nBased on this analysis, the inference \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box\" cannot be made from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
