This rule states that if we have a disjunction \"p or q\" and the negation of one of the disjuncts \"not p\", then we can infer the other disjunct \"q\".\n\nApplying this rule to the given statements, we have:\n1. Either the remote control is hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table.\n2. The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\n\nFrom 1 and 2, we can infer:\n3. The remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, the inference 'The remote control is on the coffee table' can be made from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
