The first statement \"Either the jacket is hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair\" indicates that one of these two options must be true. The second statement \"The jacket isn't hanging in the closet\" rules out the possibility of the jacket hanging in the closet.\n\nWhen we consider both statements together, we can infer that if the jacket is not hanging in the closet and it must be either hanging in the closet or draped over the chair, then it follows that \"The jacket is draped over the chair.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationship between the statements:\n1. Either the jacket is hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair.\n2. The jacket isn't hanging in the closet.\n\nBased on these premises, the conclusion can be drawn that \"The jacket is draped over the chair.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
