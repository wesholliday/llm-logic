Modus ponens states that if P then Q, and P is true, then Q must be true as well. Given that the first premise is in the form of \"if P then Q\" and the second premise is P, we can conclude that Q must be true. \n\nNow, let's apply the premises to the conclusion:\nPremise 1: If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim \nPremise 2: The pants were denim\nConclusion: The shirt was Cotton\n\nBased on the form of the argument (modus ponens) and the premises, the conclusion logically follows. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
