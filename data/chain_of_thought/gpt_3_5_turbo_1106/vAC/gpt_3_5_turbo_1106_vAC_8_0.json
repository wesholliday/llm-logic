The second premise \"The mummy was awake\" is simply P.\n\nSo, using modus ponens, if we have P \u2192 Q and P, we can logically conclude Q.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the argument:\nP \u2192 Q (If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake)\nP (The mummy was awake)\n\nBy modus ponens, we can conclude:\nQ (The vampire was awake)\n\nNow, based on this analysis, we can determine if the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
