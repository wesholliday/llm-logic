The first premise 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis' can be represented as 'If P, then Q'. The second premise 'Amy played tennis' can be represented as 'Q'. Using hypothetical syllogism, if 'If P, then Q' and 'Q' are true, then 'P' must also be true. Therefore, the conclusion 'Jeff played basketball' logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
