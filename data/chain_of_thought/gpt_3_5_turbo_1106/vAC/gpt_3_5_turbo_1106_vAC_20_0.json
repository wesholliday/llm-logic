The first premise \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\" where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow\". The second premise \"The banana was yellow\" can be represented as \"Q\". \n\nNow, using the hypothetical syllogism, if P \u2192 Q and Q, then we can conclude P. Therefore, the conclusion \"The apple was red\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
