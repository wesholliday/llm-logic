Sue was at the wedding.\n\nGiven these premises, we can't directly conclude that Mary was at the wedding. The first premise only tells us about the relationship between Mary and Sue, not whether Mary was actually at the wedding. However, the second premise tells us that Sue was at the wedding, which means that the first premise is satisfied, but it doesn't directly prove that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nBased on this analysis, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premises.",

If the premises are true and the form of the argument is valid, then the conclusion must be true.\n2. The form of the argument is valid (modus ponens).\n3. The premises are true (as stipulated).\n4.
