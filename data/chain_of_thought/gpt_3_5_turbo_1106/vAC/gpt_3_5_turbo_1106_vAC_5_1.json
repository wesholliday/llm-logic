The first premise is an \"if-then\" statement: 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis' (P1: If J, then A).\n2. The second premise is a statement: 'Amy played tennis' (P2: A).\n\nNow let's see if we can logically infer the conclusion 'Jeff played basketball' based on the premises.\n\nFor the conclusion to be logically valid given the premises, it must follow a valid logical form. In this case, we are using modus ponens, a valid form of argument where if P implies Q, and P is true, then Q must also be true.\n\nSo, substituting J for P and A for Q, the argument form would be: (P1: If J, then A), (P2: A), therefore the conclusion: J.\n\nNow, considering the premises and the form of the argument, we can see that the conclusion 'Jeff played basketball' logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
