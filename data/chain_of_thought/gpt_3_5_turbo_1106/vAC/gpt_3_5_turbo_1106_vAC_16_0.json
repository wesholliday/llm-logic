            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can use the method of modus ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement \"if P, then Q\" and we also have P, then we can logically conclude Q.\n\nIn this case, the first premise \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\" where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim\". The second premise \"The pants were denim\" can be represented as \"Q\".\n\nUsing modus ponens, if we have \"P \u2192 Q\" and \"Q\", we can logically conclude \"P\".\n\nSo, let's apply modus ponens to the premises:\n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim (P \u2192 Q)\n2. The pants were denim (Q)\n\nBy modus ponens, we can conclude:\n3. The shirt was cotton (P)\n\nNow, let's compare the conclusion with the original conclusion \"The shirt was cotton\". If the conclusion we derived matches the original conclusion, then the argument is logically valid.\n\nSo, is this form of argument logically valid?",
