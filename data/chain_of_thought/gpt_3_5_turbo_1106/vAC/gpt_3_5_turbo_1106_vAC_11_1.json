Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"if P then Q\" and we also have P, then we can validly infer Q. In your argument, the first premise is a conditional statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" (if P then Q), and the second premise is \"The muffins were blueberry\" (P). According to modus ponens, we should be able to logically infer the conclusion \"The cake was chocolate\" (Q). Now, let's apply this principle step by step:\n\n1. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry (if P then Q)\n2. The muffins were blueberry (P)\n3. Therefore, the cake was chocolate (Q)\n\nIs this form of argument logically valid?",
