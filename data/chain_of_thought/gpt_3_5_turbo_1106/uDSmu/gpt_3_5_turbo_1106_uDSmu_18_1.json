It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can infer the following:\n\n- The notebook is not necessarily on the nightstand, but it could be.\n- The notebook could be in the drawer, as that option was not ruled out.\n\nNow the question becomes, \"Can we infer that the notebook is in the drawer?\"\n\nLet's analyze the given statements:\n1. The first statement allows for the possibility of the notebook being in the drawer.\n2. The second statement does not confirm that the notebook is on the nightstand, leaving open the possibility that it could be in the drawer.\n\nConsidering both statements, it is plausible that the notebook is in the drawer, but we cannot make a definitive inference based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
