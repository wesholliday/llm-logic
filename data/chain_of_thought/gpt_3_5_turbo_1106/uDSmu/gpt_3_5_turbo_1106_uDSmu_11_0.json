It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that the newspaper is either in the driveway or on the porch. From the second statement, we can infer that it's not necessary for the newspaper to be on the porch.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we cannot definitively infer that the newspaper is in the driveway. It could still be on the porch. Therefore, we cannot make the inference that the newspaper is in the driveway.",
