The principle of contraposition states that if a conditional statement \"if A, then B\" is true, then the contrapositive \"if not B, then not A\" is also true.\n\nIn this case, the premise \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" can be represented as \"If A, then B\" where A is \"the doll was plastic\" and B is \"the truck was metal\". \n\nThe conclusion \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal\" can be represented as \"If not B, then not A\" where not B is \"the doll was not plastic\" and not A is \"the truck was not metal\".\n\nBy the principle of contraposition, the conclusion is logically equivalent to the premise, so the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
