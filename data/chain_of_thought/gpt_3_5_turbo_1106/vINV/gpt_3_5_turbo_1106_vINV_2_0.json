            "content": "To determine the logical validity of the argument, we can analyze it using the form of a hypothetical syllogism. The premise \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the griffin was in the forest\" and Q is \"the unicorn was in the forest.\" The conclusion \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest\" can be represented as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ.\n\nNow, we can check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, which is a valid form of argument. According to the rules of logical equivalence, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
