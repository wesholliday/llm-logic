The premise \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" can be represented as P -> Q, where P is \"the alien visited Mars\" and Q is \"the robot visited Jupiter.\" The conclusion \"If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter\" can be represented as ~P -> ~Q, where ~P is \"the alien did not visit Mars\" and ~Q is \"the robot did not visit Jupiter.\"\n\nNow, we can check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, the argument takes the form of the valid argument form of contraposition, which states that if P -> Q is true, then ~Q -> ~P is also true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
