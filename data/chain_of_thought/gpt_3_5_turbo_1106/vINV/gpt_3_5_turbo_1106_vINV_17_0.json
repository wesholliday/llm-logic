            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can use the principle of contraposition. The principle of contraposition states that if a conditional statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"if A, then B\" is \"if not B, then not A\".\n\nIn this case, the premise \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" can be represented as \"If A, then B\", and the conclusion \"If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad\" can be represented as \"If not B, then not A\".\n\nBy the principle of contraposition, if the premise \"If A, then B\" is true, then the conclusion \"If not B, then not A\" must also be true for the argument to be logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
