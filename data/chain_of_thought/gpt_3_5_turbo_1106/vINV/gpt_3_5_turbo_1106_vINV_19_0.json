(if p then q)\nConclusion: If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball. (if not p then not q)\n\nNow, we can see that the conclusion is the negation of the premise. This is not a valid form of argument. The conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
