            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can analyze it using the rules of logical implication. The premise \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" can be represented as \"M -> S\" where M stands for \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S stands for \"Sue was at the wedding\". The conclusion \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\" can be represented as \"~M -> ~S\" where ~M stands for \"Mary was not at the wedding\" and ~S stands for \"Sue was not at the wedding\".\n\nNow, we can use the rule of logical implication to check if the conclusion follows from the premise. The rule states that if P -> Q is true, then ~Q -> ~P is also true. In this case, if \"M -> S\" is true, then \"~S -> ~M\" is also true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
