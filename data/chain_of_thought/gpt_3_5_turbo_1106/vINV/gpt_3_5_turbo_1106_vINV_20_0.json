The premise \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" can be restated as \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\" using contraposition. \n\nNow, let's compare the conclusion \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\" with the restated premise \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\". If the conclusion matches the restated premise, then the argument is logically valid.\n\nLet's compare:\nConclusion: If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\nRestated premise: If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\n\nBy comparing the conclusion with the restated premise, we can determine if the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
