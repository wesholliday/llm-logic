The contrapositive of the premise \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\" \n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive with the conclusion \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\" If we replace \"Erin did not take a train\" with \"Sam did not take a plane\" in the contrapositive, we get \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Sam did not take a plane,\" which is a tautology and always true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
