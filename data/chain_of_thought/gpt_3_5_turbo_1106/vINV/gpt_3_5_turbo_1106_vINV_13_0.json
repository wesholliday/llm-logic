(p \u2192 q)\nConclusion: If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue. (~p \u2192 ~q)\n\nNow, we can see that the conclusion is the inverse of the premise. In logic, the inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
