            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can use the principle of contraposition. The contrapositive of the premise \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". In this case, the premise \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" can be contraposed to \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\". \n\nSo, the argument's conclusion \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\" matches the contrapositive of the premise. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
