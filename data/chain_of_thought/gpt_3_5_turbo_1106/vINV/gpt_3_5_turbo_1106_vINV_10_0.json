            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can use the method of logical equivalence. The premise \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" can be represented as \"D \u2192 C\" (where D stands for \"the dog was inside\" and C stands for \"the cat was outside\"). The conclusion \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside\" can be represented as \"\u00acD \u2192 \u00acC\" (where \u00acD stands for \"the dog was not inside\" and \u00acC stands for \"the cat was not outside\").\n\nTo check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise, we can use the logical equivalence of the contrapositive. The contrapositive of \"D \u2192 C\" is \"\u00acC \u2192 \u00acD\". If the conclusion \"\u00acD \u2192 \u00acC\" is logically equivalent to the contrapositive \"\u00acC \u2192 \u00acD\", then the argument is logically valid.\n\nLet's check if \"\u00acD \u2192 \u00acC\" is logically equivalent to \"\u00acC \u2192 \u00acD\".\n\nAnswer:  yes",
