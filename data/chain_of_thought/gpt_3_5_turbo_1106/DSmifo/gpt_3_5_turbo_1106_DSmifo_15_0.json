So, it's saying that the shoes are either by the door or in the closet.\n\nGiven these statements, we cannot infer that \"The shoes are in the closet\" because the first statement only tells us that the shoes might not be by the door, but it doesn't confirm their location. The second statement tells us that the shoes are either by the door or in the closet, but it doesn't give us enough information to determine their exact location.\n\nAnswer: no",
