If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. (P \u2192 Q)\n2. The book is a mystery novel. (Q)\n\nTo determine if \"The book was written by James\" necessarily follows, we need to check if the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nWe can use the method of modus ponens, which states that if P implies Q and P is true, then Q must be true.\n\nSo, applying modus ponens:\n1. P \u2192 Q (If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.)\n2. P (The book is a mystery novel.)\n\nBy modus ponens, we can conclude:\n3. Q (The book was written by James)\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises and using modus ponens, it necessarily follows that \"The book was written by James\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
