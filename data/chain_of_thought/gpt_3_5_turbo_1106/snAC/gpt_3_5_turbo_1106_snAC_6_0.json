This means that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob definitely chose pasta. \n\nNext, we are given that \"Bob chose pasta\" is true. This tells us that Bob indeed chose pasta.\n\nNow, based on the given information, we cannot conclude whether Sue chose pizza or not. It is possible that Sue chose pizza, but it is also possible that she chose something else. The statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" does not tell us anything about what Sue actually chose.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"Sue chose pizza\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
