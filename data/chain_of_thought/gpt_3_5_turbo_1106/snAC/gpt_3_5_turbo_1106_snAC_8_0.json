If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (Vampire \u2192 Mummy)\n2. The mummy was awake (Mummy)\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake. This is because the first statement implies that the mummy being awake requires the vampire to be awake.\n\nTherefore, it necessarily follows that \"The vampire was awake\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
