This means that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\nWe are also given that \"Chris finished the race\" is true.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot conclude that Alex finished the race. This is because the first statement only tells us what happens if Alex finishes the race, but it doesn't tell us whether Alex actually finished the race.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"Alex finished the race\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
