This means that if Jeff played basketball, then it guarantees that Amy played tennis.\n\nSecond, we are given the statement \"Amy played tennis\" is true.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can conclude that Amy playing tennis does not necessarily mean that Jeff played basketball. This is because the original statement only guarantees that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. It does not guarantee the reverse.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"Jeff played basketball\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
