This means that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. \n\nSecond, we are given the information that \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is true.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can conclude that Joe going to the park is not necessarily true. This is because the first statement only tells us what happens if Joe goes to the park, but it does not tell us whether Joe actually went to the park or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Joe went to the park based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
