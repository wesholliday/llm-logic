If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal (P \u2192 Q)\n2. The truck was metal (Q)\n\nTo determine if \"The doll was plastic\" necessarily follows, we need to check if the first statement is true and if the second statement is true. If both are true, then the conclusion \"The doll was plastic\" necessarily follows.\n\nLet's check:\n1. The first statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is true.\n2. The second statement \"The truck was metal\" is true.\n\nNow, based on the given information, we can conclude that \"The doll was plastic\" necessarily follows.\n\nAnswer: yes",
