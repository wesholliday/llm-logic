The statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter\" simply denies a necessity, but it doesn't establish the possibility of the milk not being on the counter. The conclusion \"The milk might not be on the counter\" goes beyond what the premise can support. Therefore, the argument is not valid based on the form alone.\n\nWhen something \"must be\" the case, its negation doesn't necessarily imply that it \"might not\" be the case. For example, if we say \"It's not the case that it must rain today,\" it doesn't logically follow that \"It might not rain today.\" The possibility that it might not rain has to be established separately.\n\nSo, the form of the argument is not logically valid.",
