If the premise \"It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair\" is true, then the conclusion \"The jacket might not be draped over the chair\" must also be true. This is because if it's not necessary for the jacket to be draped over the chair, then it is possible for the jacket not to be draped over the chair. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
