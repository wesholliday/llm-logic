If the premise \"It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter\" is true, then the conclusion \"The milk might not be on the counter\" must also be true. This is because if it's not necessary for the milk to be on the counter, then it is possible for the milk not to be on the counter. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
