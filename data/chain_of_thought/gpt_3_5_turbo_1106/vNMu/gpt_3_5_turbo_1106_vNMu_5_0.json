The premise \"It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball\" can be translated as \"It is not necessary that Jeff played basketball.\" The conclusion \"Jeff might not have played basketball\" can be translated as \"It is possible that Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n\nGiven these translations, the argument is logically valid. If it is not necessary for Jeff to have played basketball, then it is indeed possible that he did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
