The premise \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars\" can be represented as \u00ac(A \u2192 M), where A represents \"the alien must have visited Mars\" and M represents \"the alien visited Mars\". The conclusion \"The alien might not have visited Mars\" can be represented as \u00ac(A \u2192 M) or \u00ac(M \u2192 A).\n\nNow, let's consider the form of the argument. If the premise is \u00ac(A \u2192 M) and the conclusion is \u00ac(M \u2192 A), then the argument form is denying the consequent, which is a valid form of argument. This form of argument is valid because if the consequent (M) is denied, then the antecedent (A) cannot be affirmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
