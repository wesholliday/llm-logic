If the premise 'It's not the case that the book must have been written by James' is true, then the conclusion 'The book might not have been written by James' must also be true. This is because if it's not the case that the book must have been written by James, then it is possible that the book was not written by James. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
