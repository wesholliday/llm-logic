The premise \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" can be translated as \"It is not necessary for the toy to be in the toy box.\" The conclusion \"The toy might not be in the toy box\" can be translated as \"It is possible that the toy is not in the toy box.\"\n\nGiven these translations, the argument form is logically valid. If it is not necessary for the toy to be in the toy box, then it is indeed possible that the toy is not in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
