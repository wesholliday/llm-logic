If the premise \"It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser\" is true, then the conclusion \"The watch might not be charging on the dresser\" must also be true. This is because if it's not necessary for the watch to be charging on the dresser, then it's possible that the watch is not charging on the dresser. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
