If the premise 'It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet' is true, then the conclusion 'The shoes might not be in the closet' must also be true. This is because if it's not necessary for the shoes to be in the closet, then it is possible for them not to be in the closet. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
