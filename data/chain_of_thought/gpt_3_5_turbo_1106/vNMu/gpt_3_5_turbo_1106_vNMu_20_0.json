If the premise \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag\" is true, then its negation \"The sunglasses might not be in her bag\" must also be true. This is because if it's not necessary for the sunglasses to be in her bag, then it is possible that they are not in her bag. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
