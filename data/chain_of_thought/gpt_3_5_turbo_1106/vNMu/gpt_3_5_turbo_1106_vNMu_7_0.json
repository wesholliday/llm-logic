If the premise \"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race\" is true, then the conclusion \"Alex might not have finished the race\" must also be true. This is because if it's not necessary for Alex to have finished the race, then it is possible that Alex did not finish the race. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
