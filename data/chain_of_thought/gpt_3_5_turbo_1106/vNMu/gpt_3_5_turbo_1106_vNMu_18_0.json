The premise \"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer\" can be translated into \"It is not necessary for the notebook to be in the drawer.\" The conclusion \"The notebook might not be in the drawer\" can be translated into \"It is possible that the notebook is not in the drawer.\"\n\nGiven these translations, the argument is logically valid. If it is not necessary for the notebook to be in the drawer, then it is indeed possible that the notebook is not in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
