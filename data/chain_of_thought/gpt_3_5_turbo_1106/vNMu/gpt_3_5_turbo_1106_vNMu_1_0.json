The premise \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" can be represented as \u00ac(necessarily Mary was at the wedding). The conclusion \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" can be represented as possibly (Mary was not at the wedding).\n\nThe argument form can be represented as \u00ac(necessarily p) therefore possibly \u00acp. This is a valid form of argument known as the rule of negation introduction in modal logic. This rule states that if it is not necessary that p, then it is possible that not p.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
