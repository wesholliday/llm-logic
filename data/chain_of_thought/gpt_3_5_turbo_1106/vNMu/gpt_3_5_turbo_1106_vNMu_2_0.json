If the premise \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\" is true, then it follows that the griffin is not necessarily in the forest. If the conclusion \"The griffin might not have been in the forest\" is also true, then it is consistent with the premise. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
