The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" can be translated as \"Not red or yellow.\"\n2. The statement \"The banana was yellow\" can be simply stated as \"Yellow.\"\n\nSo, combining these two pieces of information, we have \"Not red or yellow\" and \"Yellow.\" From this, we cannot conclude that the apple was red, as there is no direct information about the color of the apple.\n\nAnswer: no",
