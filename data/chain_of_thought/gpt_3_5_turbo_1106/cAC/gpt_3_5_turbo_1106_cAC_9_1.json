According to 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt', the implication is 'If P, then Q'. In this case, P is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and Q is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. Since the statement is given to be true, then P implies Q.\n\n2. Check if the second statement is true. According to 'Mark bought the blue shirt', this statement is true.\n\n3. Determine whether we can conclude 'Lisa bought the red shirt' from the given information.\n\nBy applying modus ponens (affirming the antecedent), if P implies Q and P is true, then we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",

The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" can be symbolized as \"L -> M\" (where L stands for Lisa buying the red shirt and M stands for Mark buying the blue shirt). The second statement \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" can be symbolized as \"M\".\n\nNow, let's reason through it. If the first statement is true and Lisa bought the red shirt (L), then Mark would have had to buy the blue shirt (M), which confirms the validity of the first statement. However, we don't know if Lisa bought the red shirt; it could be that she didn't buy any shirt at all. We only know that Mark bought the blue shirt. So, based on the given statements, we cannot conclude for certain that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
