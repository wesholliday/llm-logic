However, it does not tell us anything about the doll if the truck is metal.\n\nNow, we are given the statement \"The truck was metal.\" This tells us that the truck is indeed metal.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot conclude that \"The doll was plastic.\" This is because the first statement only tells us about the relationship between the doll and the truck, but it does not provide any information about the doll when the truck is metal.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that the doll was plastic based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
