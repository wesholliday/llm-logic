It only tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This statement tells us that Sue was indeed at the wedding.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot conclude that Mary was at the wedding. The first statement does not provide any information about Mary's actual presence at the wedding, and the second statement only tells us about Sue's presence.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Mary was at the wedding based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
