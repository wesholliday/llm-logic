The conditional statement did not state that the only way for the truck to be blue is if the car was red. There may be other possibilities for the color of the car in the given scenario.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclusively infer \"The car was red\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",

If there are other conditions that can make the truck blue (apart from the car being red), then we cannot conclude that the car was red.\n\nGiven the information, \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and \"The truck was blue\", we cannot directly conclude that \"The car was red\" unless we assume there are no other ways for the truck to be blue.\n\nBy using the contrapositive of the initial conditional statement, we can conclude that \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\".

Since we are given that \"The truck was blue\", and the conditional statement states \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue,\" we can't conclusively say that \"The car was red\" based on the information given.
