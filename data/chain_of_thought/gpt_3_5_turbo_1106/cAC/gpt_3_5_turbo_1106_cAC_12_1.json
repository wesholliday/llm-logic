If the first statement is true and the second statement is true, then the implication holds. It is possible that Joe went to the park and Lucy went to the zoo.\n2. If the first statement is true and the second statement is false, then the implication is false.\n\nBased on this, we cannot directly conclude whether Joe went to the park.
