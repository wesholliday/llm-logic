The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" The second statement is a simple statement: \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nNow, we can use the law of detachment, which states that if a conditional statement is true and its hypothesis is true, then its conclusion is also true. In this case, the conditional statement is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo,\" and the hypothesis \"Joe went to the park\" is not given as true. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Joe went to the park based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
