The contrapositive of \"if p, then q\" is \"if not q, then not p.\" In this case, it would be \"if Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nSince we know that Jen watched basketball, the contrapositive tells us that Tom did watch football.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that Tom watched football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
