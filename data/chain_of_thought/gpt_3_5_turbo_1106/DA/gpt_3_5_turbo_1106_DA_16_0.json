The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If p, then q\" is \"If not q, then not p\".\n\nSo, the contrapositive of \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\".\n\nGiven that the shirt was not cotton, we can infer from the contrapositive that the pants were not denim.\n\nAnswer: yes",
