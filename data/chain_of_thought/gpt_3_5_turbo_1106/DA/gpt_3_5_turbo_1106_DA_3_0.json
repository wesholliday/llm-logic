The contrapositive of the original conditional statement is \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\"\n\nSo, when we combine \"The book was not written by James\" with the contrapositive of the original statement, we can infer \"The book is not a mystery novel.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
