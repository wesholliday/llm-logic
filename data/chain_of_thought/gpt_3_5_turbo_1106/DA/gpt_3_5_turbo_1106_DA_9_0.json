This is because the original conditional statement does not provide any information about what happens if Lisa did not buy the red shirt. It only tells us what happens if she did buy the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
