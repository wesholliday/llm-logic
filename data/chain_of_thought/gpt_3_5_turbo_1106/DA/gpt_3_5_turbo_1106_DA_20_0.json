This statement can be represented as \"P -> Q\" where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow\".\n\nNow, we are given the additional information \"The apple was not red\", which can be represented as \"~P\" where \"~\" denotes \"not\".\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"The banana was not yellow\", which can be represented as \"~Q\".\n\nTo do this, we can use the rule of inference called Modus Tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement \"P -> Q\" and the consequent Q is false, then the antecedent P must also be false.\n\nSo, applying Modus Tollens to our situation, we have:\n1. P -> Q (original statement)\n2. ~P (given information)\n\nUsing Modus Tollens, we can infer ~Q.\n\nNow, based on this logical reasoning, can we infer \"The banana was not yellow\"?\n\nAnswer: yes",
