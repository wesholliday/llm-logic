This means that if the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true. \n\nGiven that Erin took a train, we can infer that the first statement is true, and therefore Sam took a plane. This is because the first statement states a conditional relationship, and if the second part of the conditional statement is true, then the first part must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
