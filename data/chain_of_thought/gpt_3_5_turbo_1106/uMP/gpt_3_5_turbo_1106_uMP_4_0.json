From these two statements, we can infer that the robot visited Jupiter. This is because the first statement establishes a conditional relationship between the alien visiting Mars and the robot visiting Jupiter. Since the alien did visit Mars, it satisfies the condition, and we can conclude that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
