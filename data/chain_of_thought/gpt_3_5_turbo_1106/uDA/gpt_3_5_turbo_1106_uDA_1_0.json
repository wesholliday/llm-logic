Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. However, the second statement tells us that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\nIf Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. Since Mary was not at the wedding, we cannot make any conclusions about Sue.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer whether Sue was at the wedding or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
