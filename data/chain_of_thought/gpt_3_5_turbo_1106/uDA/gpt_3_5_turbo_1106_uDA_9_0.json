Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nFrom the given information, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, so the first part of the conditional statement is false. This means we cannot make any conclusions about Mark buying the blue shirt based on this conditional statement.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement:\n3. Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nFrom this statement, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. However, this does not provide any information about whether Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
