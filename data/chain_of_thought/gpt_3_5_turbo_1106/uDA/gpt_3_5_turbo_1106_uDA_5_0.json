Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nGiven the information, we can conclude that Amy did not play tennis. Now, let's think about it step by step and reason through it.\n\n1. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. Since Jeff did not play basketball, we cannot infer anything about Amy's activity based on this statement alone.\n\n2. Jeff did not play basketball. This means that the condition in the conditional statement is not met, so we cannot conclude anything about Amy's activity based on this conditional statement.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot infer that Amy did not play tennis.\n\nAnswer: no",
