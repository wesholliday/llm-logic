Joe did not go to the park.\n\nFrom the given information, we can infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo. This is because the first statement creates a conditional relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo. Since Joe did not go to the park, the condition for Lucy going to the zoo is not met, so we can infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: yes",
