(~p)\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer that Kate did not eat salad. To do this, we can use the contrapositive of the first statement:\n- The contrapositive of p \u2192 q is ~q \u2192 ~p.\n\nSo, if we apply the contrapositive to the first statement, we get:\n3. If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta. (~q \u2192 ~p)\n\nNow, combining statement 2 and 3, we can infer:\n4. Ben did not eat pasta, so Kate did not eat salad. (~p \u2192 ~q)\n\nNow, we can conclude that Kate did not eat salad.\n\nAnswer: yes",
