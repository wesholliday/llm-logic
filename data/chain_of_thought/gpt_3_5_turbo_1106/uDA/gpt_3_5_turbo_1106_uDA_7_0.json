(Not A)\n\nFrom the given information, we can infer that Chris did not necessarily finish the race. This is because the first statement does not guarantee that Chris finished the race if Alex did not. It only states the condition if Alex finished, then Chris finished. Since we know Alex did not finish, we cannot conclude anything about Chris.\n\nAnswer: no",
