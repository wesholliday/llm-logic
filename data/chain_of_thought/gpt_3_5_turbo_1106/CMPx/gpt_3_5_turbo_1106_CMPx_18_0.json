    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a blimfet, a crongle, and a narzil are the leading bafwidgers. Experts expect the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most this year, followed by the crongle, with the narzil bafwidging much less. These are the only major bafwidgers, so if the crongle doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, then if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most. Moreover, the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most, and hence the crongle likely won\u2019t bafwidge the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will?",

If the crongle doesn't bafwidge the most, then if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most.\n3. The blimfet is likely to bafwidge the most, and hence the crongle likely won't bafwidge the most.\n\nGiven this information, if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, it's likely that the narzil will bafwidge the most.\n\nNow, let's consider the logic:\n- If the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, then the crongle likely won't bafwidge the most, and according to the second point, the narzil will bafwidge the most.\n\nSo, based on the given information, it is likely that if the blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most, the narzil will.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
