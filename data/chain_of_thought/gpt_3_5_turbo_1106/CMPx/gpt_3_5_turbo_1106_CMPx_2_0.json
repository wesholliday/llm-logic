    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

Since the jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, it is likely that the jantiz will get the zulision.\n\nNow, let's consider the cramen. If the cramen doesn't get the zulision, then it is stated that if the jantiz doesn't get it, the sulect will. This means that if the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, the sulect is likely to get it.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it is likely that if the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, the sulect will.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
