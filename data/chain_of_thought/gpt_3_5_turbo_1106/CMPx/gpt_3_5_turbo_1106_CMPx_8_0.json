    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trendel, a laxum, and a doffen are candidates for Best Ploggel at the National Zorple Championship. Handlers consider the trendel the frontrunner for Best Ploggel, followed by the laxum, while the doffen is a long shot to win. Since these are the only contenders, if the laxum doesn\u2019t win Best Ploggel, then if the trendel doesn\u2019t win, the doffen will win. Moreover, the trendel likely will win Best Ploggel and hence the laxum likely won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trendel doesn\u2019t win Best Ploggel, the doffen will?",

The doffen is a long shot to win.\n\nNow, let's consider the conditional statements:\n- If the laxum doesn\u2019t win Best Ploggel, then if the trendel doesn\u2019t win, the doffen will win.\n- Moreover, the trendel likely will win Best Ploggel and hence the laxum likely won\u2019t win.\n\nGiven these statements, if the trendel doesn\u2019t win Best Ploggel, it is likely that the laxum won\u2019t win. And if the laxum doesn\u2019t win, then if the trendel doesn\u2019t win, the doffen will win. So, it is likely that if the trendel doesn\u2019t win Best Ploggel, the doffen will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
