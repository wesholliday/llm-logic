    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crinel, a nafiz, and a tomul are competing to be snarggle of next year's laggle team. The crinel is considered the frontrunner for snarggle, followed by the nafiz, while the tomul is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates, if the nafiz isn\u2019t named snarggle, then if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle. Moreover, the crinel likely will be named snarggle and hence the nafiz likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be?",

The tomul is a long shot for snarggle.\n4. If the nafiz isn\u2019t named snarggle, then if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle.\n\nGiven that the crinel is likely to be named snarggle and the nafiz likely won\u2019t be, it seems that the tomul has a higher chance of being named snarggle if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle. This is because if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the only other option according to the given information is the tomul.\n\nSo, it is likely that if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be.\n\nAnswer: yes",
