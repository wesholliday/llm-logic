    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a garplex, a beelhet, and a peedonk are competing to be domer of the year. Experts think the garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, with the peedonk having a much lower chance. Since these are the only domer candidates, if the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer. Moreover, it is likely the garplex will become domer and hence the beelhet likely won\u2019t become domer. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will?",

            "content": "First, let's consider the likelihood of the garplex becoming domer. The experts think the garplex is most likely to win, so it is reasonable to assume that it is likely that the garplex will become domer.\n\nNext, let's consider the likelihood of the beelhet becoming domer. The experts think the beelhet has a lower chance than the garplex, and it is also mentioned that it is likely the garplex will become domer and hence the beelhet likely won\u2019t become domer. So, it is reasonable to assume that it is less likely for the beelhet to become domer.\n\nNow, let's consider the likelihood of the peedonk becoming domer. It is mentioned that if the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer. Since the beelhet is less likely to become domer, it follows that if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk is likely to become domer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it is likely that if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
