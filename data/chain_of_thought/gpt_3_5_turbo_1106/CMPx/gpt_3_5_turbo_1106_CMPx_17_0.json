    "user_prompt": "Suppose a flinker, a dringen, and a n\u00fcffen have the best projections to have a breakout season next year. Talent scouts believe it's highly probable the flinker will have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen, while the n\u00fcffen is an outside shot. Since these are the only top prospects, if the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. Moreover, scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season and hence the dringen likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will?",

            "content": "First, let's consider the likelihood of the flinker having a breakout season. The scouts believe it's highly probable, so we can assume it's likely.\n\nNext, let's consider the dringen. The scouts believe it's closely followed by the flinker in terms of likelihood, but also that it's likely the dringen won't have a breakout season if the flinker does.\n\nNow, if the dringen doesn't have a breakout season, the scouts believe it's likely that the n\u00fcffen will. This means that the likelihood of the n\u00fcffen having a breakout season is tied to the dringen not having one.\n\nGiven that the scouts think it's likely the flinker will have a breakout season, we can infer that it's unlikely for the dringen to have one. Therefore, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, it's likely that the dringen won't either, which in turn makes it likely that the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season.\n\nSo, based on the given information, it does follow that it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
