    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trenist, a lanken, and a draloid are shortlisted for Drij of the Year. The trenist is considered the front runner, followed by the lanken, while the draloid is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates in contention, if the lanken doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the trenist doesn\u2019t win it, the draloid will win it. Moreover, the trenist likely will win the award and hence the lanken likely won\u2019t win it. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trenist doesn\u2019t win Drij of the Year, the draloid will?",

If the lanken doesn\u2019t win, and the trenist doesn\u2019t win, then the draloid will win.\n5. The trenist likely will win the award, and hence the lanken likely won\u2019t win it.\n\nGiven this information, if the trenist doesn\u2019t win, it means the lanken also doesn\u2019t win. According to the information, if the trenist doesn\u2019t win, the draloid will win. Additionally, it is likely that the trenist will win, so it is likely that if the trenist doesn\u2019t win, the draloid will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
