    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a tropin, a loment, and a dralid are the top scoring vilcants this season. Experts expect the tropin likely will have the highest vilcant rate, followed by the loment, with the dralid significantly lower. These lead the vilcants, so if the loment doesn\u2019t have the top vilcant rate, then if the tropin doesn\u2019t, the dralid will. Moreover, the tropin likely will lead in vilcants and hence the loment likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the tropin doesn\u2019t lead in vilcants, the dralid will?",

If the loment doesn't have the top vilcant rate, then if the tropin doesn't, the dralid will.\n3. The tropin likely will lead in vilcants and hence the loment likely won't.\n\nGiven this information, if the tropin doesn't lead in vilcants, then the loment won't either, and the dralid will have the top vilcant rate.\n\nSo, it is likely that if the tropin doesn't lead in vilcants, the dralid will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
