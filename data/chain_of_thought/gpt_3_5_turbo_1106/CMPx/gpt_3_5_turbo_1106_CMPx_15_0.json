    "user_prompt": "Suppose a fantole, a dribban, and a snorpul have the best odds to win this season's Rizzle Cup. Oddsmakers believe it's most probable the fantole will capture the cup, followed by the dribban, while the snorpul is a heavy longshot. Since these are the only top contenders, if the dribban doesn\u2019t win the cup, then if the fantole doesn\u2019t win, the snorpul will win. Moreover, the fantole likely will win the cup and hence the dribban likely won't win. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will?",

            "content": "First, let's break down the information given:\n1. The fantole has the best odds to win the cup, followed by the dribban, while the snorpul is a heavy longshot.\n2. If the dribban doesn\u2019t win the cup, then if the fantole doesn\u2019t win, the snorpul will win.\n3. The fantole likely will win the cup and hence the dribban likely won't win.\n\nGiven this information, if the fantole doesn't win, the snorpul will win. This is because if the fantole doesn't win, and the dribban also doesn't win (as indicated by the third statement), then according to the second statement, the snorpul will win.\n\nSo, it is likely that if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
