    "user_prompt": "Suppose a stribben, a vanoon, and a jentapp are applying to rent a bondle. The owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant, followed by the vanoon, while the jentapp seems much less qualified to rent a bondle. Since these are the only applicants, if the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, then if the stribben isn\u2019t selected, the jentapp will be selected. Moreover, the stribben likely will be chosen and hence the vanoon likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the stribben isn\u2019t selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be?",

            "content": "First, let's consider the likelihood of the stribben being selected. The owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant, so it is likely that the stribben will be selected.\n\nNext, let's consider the likelihood of the vanoon being selected. The owner thinks the vanoon is the second strongest applicant, but it is mentioned that the stribben is likely to be chosen and hence the vanoon likely won\u2019t be. So, it is less likely that the vanoon will be selected.\n\nNow, let's consider the jentapp. It is mentioned that if the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, then if the stribben isn\u2019t selected, the jentapp will be selected. Since the vanoon is less likely to be selected, there is a higher likelihood that if the stribben isn\u2019t selected, the jentapp will be.\n\nSo, based on the given information, it is likely that if the stribben isn\u2019t selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be.\n\nAnswer: yes",
