    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantole, a dribban, and a cruggit are the most downloaded fillip apps this month. Market watchers expect the fantole likely will retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit download rate significantly lower. These lead the downloads, so if the dribban isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn\u2019t, the cruggit will be. Moreover, the fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fantole isn\u2019t the most downloaded, the cruggit will be?",

The cruggit is expected to have significantly lower downloads.\n4. If the dribban isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn\u2019t, the cruggit will be.\n5. The fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won\u2019t.\n\nGiven this information, if the fantole isn\u2019t the most downloaded, the cruggit will be. This is because if the fantole isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then according to the information provided, the cruggit will be the most downloaded.\n\nSo, it does follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fantole isn\u2019t the most downloaded, the cruggit will be.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
