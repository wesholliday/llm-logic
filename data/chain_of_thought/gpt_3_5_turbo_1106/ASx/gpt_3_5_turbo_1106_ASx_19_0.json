The original statement \"If the krimp is in the zool, then the snarf will be glonked\" can be represented as P -> Q, where P is \"the krimp is in the zool\" and Q is \"the snarf will be glonked\". \n\nNow, to infer the second statement \"If the krimp is in the zool and the zool is zapped, then the snarf will be glonked\", we need to use the rule of conjunction. This means we combine the original statement with the new information \"the zool is zapped\" to form the compound statement (P and R) -> Q, where R is \"the zool is zapped\".\n\nSo, the inference is valid if we assume that \"the zool being zapped\" is a necessary condition for \"the snarf will be glonked\" in addition to \"the krimp being in the zool\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
