The first statement \"If the klank is hooped, then the wuggy will zink\" does not provide any information about the wuggy being out of zloat. Therefore, we cannot directly infer the second statement from the first without additional information.\n\nWe would need a separate statement that connects the hooped klank and the wuggy being out of zloat in order to make the inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
