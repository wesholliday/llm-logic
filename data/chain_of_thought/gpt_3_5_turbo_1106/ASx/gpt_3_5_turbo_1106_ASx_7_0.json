The original statement \"If the tizzer is on, then the goom is snurpled\" does not provide any information about the plink light. Therefore, we cannot directly infer the second statement from the first.\n\nHowever, if there is additional information or a logical connection between the tizzer being on, the plink light being out, and the goom being snurpled, then we may be able to make the inference.\n\nDo you want to proceed with this reasoning?",
