The original statement can be represented as \"p \u2192 q,\" where p is \"the zink is in the snaffle\" and q is \"it is tinking.\" \n\nTo infer the new statement, we need to add a new condition, \"it is bazoogled,\" to the original statement. This can be represented as \"p \u2227 r \u2192 q,\" where r is \"it is bazoogled.\" \n\nNow, we need to check if the new statement is a valid inference based on the original statement and the added condition.\n\nAnswer: yes",
