The original statement \"If the plim is grobbled, then the whiffle will sploosh\" can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the plim is grobbled\" and Q is \"the whiffle will sploosh\". \n\nNow, to infer the second statement \"If the plim is grobbled and the drazzle is drooped, then the whiffle will sploosh\", we can use the rule of conjunction. This rule states that if P \u2192 Q is true and R \u2192 Q is true, then (P and R) \u2192 Q is also true. \n\nSo, in this case, we can infer the second statement from the first using the rule of conjunction. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
