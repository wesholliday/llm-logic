It only establishes a conditional relationship between paying the bill and the services continuing.\n\nIn the new statement \"If the bill is paid and the check bounces, then the services will continue,\" we are adding a new condition (the check bouncing) to the original statement. However, the original statement does not provide any information about what happens if the check bounces.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
