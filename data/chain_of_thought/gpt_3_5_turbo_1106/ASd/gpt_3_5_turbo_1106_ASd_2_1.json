It just states that going to the concert will lead to a good time.\n\nSecondly, introducing a bomb going off to the statement changes its meaning and introduces a completely different scenario. It does not logically follow from the original statement.\n\nThirdly, the addition of the scenario of a bomb going off has no direct correlation or logical connection to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
