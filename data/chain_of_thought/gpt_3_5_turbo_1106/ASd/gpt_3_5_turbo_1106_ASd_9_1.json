If we have \"if p then q\" and we also have \"p and r\", then we cannot directly infer \"q and r\". \nGiven the statement \"If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A\", if we also have the statement \"the essay is well-written and turned in late\", we cannot directly infer that \"the student will get an A\". This is because in the original implication, there is nothing directly stated about the relationship between turning in late and receiving an A. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that combination from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
