The original statement \"If you fill up the gas tank, the car will run\" implies that filling up the gas tank is a sufficient condition for the car to run. However, the second statement introduces a new condition (the presence of a hole in the gas tank) in addition to filling up the gas tank. \n\nTo infer the second statement, we need to know whether the presence of a hole in the gas tank affects the car's ability to run, in addition to the gas tank being filled. Without this information, we cannot make a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
