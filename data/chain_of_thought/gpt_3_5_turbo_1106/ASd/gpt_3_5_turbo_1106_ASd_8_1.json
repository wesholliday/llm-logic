The original statement can be rewritten as \"If A, then B\", where A represents \"the package has shipped\" and B represents \"it will arrive today\".\n\nNow, let's consider the new statement \"If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today\". This can be rewritten as \"If A and C, then B\", where A is \"the package has shipped\", C is \"it was misrouted\", and B is \"it will arrive today\".\n\nFor the new statement to be a correct inference, it must be the case that if A and C are true, then B is also true.
