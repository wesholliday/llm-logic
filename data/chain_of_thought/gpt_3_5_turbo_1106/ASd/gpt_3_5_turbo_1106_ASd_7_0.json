If the pilot light being out does not affect the warmth of the kitchen when the oven is on, then we can infer the second statement. However, if the pilot light being out does affect the warmth of the kitchen when the oven is on, then we cannot infer the second statement.\n\nTo determine this, we need to know if the pilot light being out affects the warmth of the kitchen when the oven is on.
