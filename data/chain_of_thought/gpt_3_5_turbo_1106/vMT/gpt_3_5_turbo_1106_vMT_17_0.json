If we assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false, we can derive a contradiction. \n\nAssuming the premises are true:\n1. If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad (Premise)\n2. Kate did not eat salad (Premise)\n\nNow, let's assume the conclusion 'Ben did not eat pasta' is false:\n3. Ben ate pasta (Assumption for contradiction)\n\nFrom premise 1, if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. But from premise 2, Kate did not eat salad. This contradicts the assumption that Ben ate pasta, leading to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
