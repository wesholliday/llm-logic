From the first premise, if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n3. But the second premise states that the cat was not outside, which contradicts the first premise.\n4. Therefore, the assumption that the dog was inside leads to a contradiction.\n\nNow, let's assume the conclusion is false, i.e., the dog was inside.\n1. If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside (from the first premise).\n2. But the second premise states that the cat was not outside, which contradicts the assumption.\n3. Therefore, the assumption that the conclusion is false leads to a contradiction.\n\nSince assuming the conclusion is false leads to a contradiction, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
