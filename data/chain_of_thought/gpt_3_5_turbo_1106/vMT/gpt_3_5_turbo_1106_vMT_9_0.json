If we assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false, we can derive a contradiction. \n\nAssuming the first premise \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true, and the second premise \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" is also true, we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is a valid logical deduction based on the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
