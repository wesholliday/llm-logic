Then, by the first premise, the truck was metal. But the second premise states that the truck was not metal, which contradicts our initial assumption. \n\nNext, assume the doll was not plastic. Then, the conclusion follows directly from the first premise. \n\nSince in both cases the conclusion follows logically from the premises, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
