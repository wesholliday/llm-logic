If we assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false, we can derive a contradiction. \n\nAssuming the premises are true:\n1. If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n2. The truck was not blue.\n\nNow, let's assume the conclusion is false:\n3. The car was red.\n\nFrom premise 1, if the car was red, then the truck was blue. But from premise 2, the truck was not blue. This contradicts the assumption that the conclusion is false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
