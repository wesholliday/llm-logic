According to the first premise, if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. But the second premise states that the wolf was not in the den, which contradicts the first premise. \n\nTherefore, if we assume the bear was in the cave, it leads to a contradiction. This means that the conclusion 'The bear was not in the cave' logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
