According to the first premise, if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. But the second premise states that the robot did not visit Jupiter, which contradicts the first premise. \n\nTherefore, if we assume the opposite, that the alien did not visit Mars, then the conclusion follows logically. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
