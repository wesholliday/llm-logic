If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n2. Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's assume the conclusion is false:\n3. Joe went to the park.\n\nIf we assume Joe went to the park, then according to the first premise, Lucy went to the zoo. But the second premise states that Lucy did not go to the zoo, which contradicts our assumption. Therefore, the conclusion 'Joe did not go to the park' must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
