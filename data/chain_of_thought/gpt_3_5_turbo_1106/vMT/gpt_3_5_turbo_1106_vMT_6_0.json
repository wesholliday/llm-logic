If we assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false, we can derive a contradiction. \n\nAssuming the premises are true:\n1. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n2. Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nNow, let's assume the conclusion is false:\n3. Sue chose pizza.\n\nFrom premise 1, if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. But from premise 2, Bob did not choose pasta, which contradicts the assumption that Sue chose pizza.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
