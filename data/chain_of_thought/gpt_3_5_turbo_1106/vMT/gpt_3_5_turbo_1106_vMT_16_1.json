Let's use C for \"the shirt was cotton\" and D for \"the pants were denim\". \n\nPremise 1: If C, then D.\nPremise 2: Not D.\nConclusion: Not C.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the argument form to see if it is logically valid. We can see that the argument form is a valid form of reasoning known as modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if 'If A, then B' and 'not B' are true, then 'not A' must be true. In this argument, the premises and the conclusion match this form, so this is a valid form of argument.\n\nAnswer: Yes",

The first premise \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" can be written as \"Shirt \u2192 Pants\". The second premise \"The pants were not denim\" can be written as \"\u00acPants\". \n\nNow, if we assume that the shirt was cotton and use the first premise, we would conclude that the pants were denim. However, since the second premise states that the pants were not denim, this assumption leads to a contradiction. Therefore, we can infer that if the pants were not denim (\u00acPants), then the shirt was not cotton (\u00acShirt). \n\nThis leads us to the logically valid argument form:\n\n1. If A, then B\n2. Not B\n3. Therefore, not A\n\nThis argument form is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of reasoning in propositional logic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
