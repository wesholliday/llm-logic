The argument is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A, then B.\" The first premise is the antecedent (A), the second premise is the negation of the consequent (\u00acB), and the conclusion is the negation of the antecedent (\u00acA).\n\nThe form of the argument is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens states that if \"If A, then B\" and \"\u00acB\" are true, then \"\u00acA\" must also be true.\n\nSo, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
