Then, according to the first premise, Erin took a train. But the second premise states that Erin did not take a train, which contradicts our initial assumption. Therefore, our assumption that Sam took a plane leads to a contradiction.\n\nThis means that the conclusion 'Sam did not take a plane' is logically valid based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
