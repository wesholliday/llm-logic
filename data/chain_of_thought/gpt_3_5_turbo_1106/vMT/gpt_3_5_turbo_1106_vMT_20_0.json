If we assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false, we can derive a contradiction. \n\nAssuming the first premise \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is true, and the second premise \"The banana was not yellow\" is also true, we can conclude that the apple was not red. This is because if the apple was red, then the banana would have been yellow, but the second premise states that the banana was not yellow, so the apple cannot be red.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
