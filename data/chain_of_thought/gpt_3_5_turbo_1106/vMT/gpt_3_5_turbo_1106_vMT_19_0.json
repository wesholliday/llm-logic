This means that Tom watched football despite Jen not watching basketball. \n\nUsing the first premise 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball', and the fact that Jen did not watch basketball, we can conclude that Tom did not watch football. \n\nSince our assumption led to a contradiction, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
