Then, according to the first premise, Amy played tennis. However, the second premise states that Amy did not play tennis, which contradicts our initial assumption. Therefore, our assumption that Jeff played basketball leads to a contradiction.\n\nThis means that the conclusion 'Jeff did not play basketball' logically follows from the premises, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
