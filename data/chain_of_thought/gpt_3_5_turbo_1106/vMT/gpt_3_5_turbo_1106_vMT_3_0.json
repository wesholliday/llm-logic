If we assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false, we can check if that leads to a contradiction.\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. (Premise)\n2. The book is not a mystery novel. (Premise)\n3. Assume the conclusion is false: The book was written by James.\n\nIf the book was written by James (as assumed), then according to premise 1, it must be a mystery novel. But premise 2 states that the book is not a mystery novel, which contradicts our assumption. Therefore, the conclusion 'The book was not written by James' must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
