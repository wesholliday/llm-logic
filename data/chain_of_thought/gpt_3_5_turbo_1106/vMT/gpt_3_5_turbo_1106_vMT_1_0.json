If we assume that Mary was at the wedding and then use the first premise 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', we can conclude that Sue was at the wedding. However, the second premise states 'Sue was not at the wedding', which contradicts our initial assumption. Therefore, the argument is logically valid if we assume that the premises are true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
