If we assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false, we can derive a contradiction. \n\nAssuming the cake was chocolate, from the first premise, we can conclude that the muffins were blueberry. However, the second premise states that the muffins were not blueberry, which contradicts our initial assumption. Therefore, the conclusion 'The cake was not chocolate' must be true if the premises are true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
