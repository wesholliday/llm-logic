It doesn't tell us anything about the cat being inside or the dog being outside.\n2. \"The cat was not outside\" - This tells us that the cat was inside.\n\nNow, let's combine the information:\n- If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n- The cat was not outside.\n\nFrom the given information, we cannot directly infer that the dog was inside. The first statement only tells us about the relationship between the dog being inside and the cat being outside, but it doesn't provide any information about the dog being outside or the cat being inside.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the dog was inside based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
