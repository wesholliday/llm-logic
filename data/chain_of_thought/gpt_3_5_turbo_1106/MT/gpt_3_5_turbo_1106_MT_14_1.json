We have the statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\"\n2. We also have the statement \"The wolf was not in the den.\"\n\nNow, let's use the law of contrapositive, which states that the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\n3. Therefore, if we take the contrapositive of the first statement, it becomes \"If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nNow, our conclusion is based on these two premises: the original conditional statement and the negation of the consequent.\n\nSo, based on these steps, can we infer \"The bear was not in the cave\"?",
