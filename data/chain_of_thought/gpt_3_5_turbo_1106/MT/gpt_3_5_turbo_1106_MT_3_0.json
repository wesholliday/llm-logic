The contrapositive of \"If p, then q\" is \"If not q, then not p\". In this case, the contrapositive of the given conditional statement is \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James\".\n\nNow, based on the given premises and the contrapositive, can we infer \"The book was not written by James\"?\n\nAnswer: yes",
