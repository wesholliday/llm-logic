However, if the car is not red, we cannot make any conclusions about the color of the truck.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"The truck was not blue.\" This tells us that the truck was not blue, but it doesn't provide any information about the color of the car.\n\nGiven this, we cannot infer \"The car was not red\" from the original statement and the second statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
