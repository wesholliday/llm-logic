It only tells us about the muffins when the cake is chocolate.\n\nStep 2: The second statement \"The muffins were not blueberry\" tells us that the muffins cannot be blueberry, but it doesn't tell us anything about the cake.\n\nStep 3: Combining the two statements, we know that the cake was not chocolate, because if it were chocolate, then the muffins would have been blueberry, which is not the case. So, the cake cannot be chocolate.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The cake was not chocolate.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
