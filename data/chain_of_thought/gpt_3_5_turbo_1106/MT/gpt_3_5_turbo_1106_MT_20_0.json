            "content": "First, let's break down the original statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" into its logical form. This statement can be represented as \"A -> B\" where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow\".\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"The banana was not yellow\". This can be represented as \"~B\" where \"~\" represents \"not\".\n\nUsing these representations, we can apply the contrapositive of the original statement to the second statement. The contrapositive of \"A -> B\" is \"~B -> ~A\". So, if we apply the contrapositive to the second statement, we get \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\".\n\nTherefore, from the original statement together with \"The banana was not yellow\", we can infer \"The apple was not red\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
