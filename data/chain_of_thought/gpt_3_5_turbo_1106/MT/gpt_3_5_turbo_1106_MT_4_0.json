The robot did not visit Jupiter (~R)\n\nNow, we want to determine if we can infer \"The alien did not visit Mars\" from the given information.\n\nTo do this, we can use the contrapositive of the first statement:\n- The contrapositive of \"If A, then R\" is \"If ~R, then ~A\" (If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars)\n\nGiven that the robot did not visit Jupiter (~R), we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars (~A) based on the contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: yes",
