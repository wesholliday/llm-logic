This implies the negation of the consequent in the original conditional statement.\n\nFrom these two statements, we are not able to directly infer \"Ben did not eat pasta\", as the absence of Kate eating the salad does not establish whether Ben ate pasta or not. The original conditional statement tells us what happens if Ben ate pasta, but it does not tell us anything about Ben not eating pasta.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer that \"Ben did not eat pasta\".\n\nNow, from the given question, we can see that the logical connection is based on modus tollens, a valid form of argument. This form of argument states that if a conditional statement is true and the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false. However, in this case, the original conditional statement does not provide direct information about whether Ben did or did not eat pasta.
