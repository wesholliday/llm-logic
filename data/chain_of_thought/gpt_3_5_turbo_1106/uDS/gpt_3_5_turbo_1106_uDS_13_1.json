This is a disjunction (an \"or\" statement), which means at least one part of the statement is true.\n2. The toy isn't sitting on the shelf. This is a negation, which means the statement \"the toy is sitting on the shelf\" is false.\n\nGiven this information, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box. If the toy is not sitting on the shelf and the options are the toy being in the toy box or sitting on the shelf, then the only remaining possibility is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
