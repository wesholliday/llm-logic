This is because the statement \"Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked\" implies that one of these two conditions must be true. Since we know the splat is not quanked, it follows that it must be morphed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The splat is morphed\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
