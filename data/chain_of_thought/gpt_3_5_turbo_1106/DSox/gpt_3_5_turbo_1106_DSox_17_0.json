This is because the statement \"Either A or B\" means that at least one of A or B is true. So, if it is not B (movated), then it must be A (skizzled).\n\nNow, combining the two statements, we have \"The flob is not movated\" and \"If it is not movated, then it is skizzled.\" Therefore, we can infer that \"The flob is skizzled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
