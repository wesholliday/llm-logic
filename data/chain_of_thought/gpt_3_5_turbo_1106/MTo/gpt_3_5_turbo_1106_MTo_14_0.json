From statement 2, we can infer that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. \n\nNow, let's consider the contrapositive of statement 2: \"If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\" \n\nSo, if the wolf was not in the den, it follows that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
