This is because if Tom had watched football, then Jen would have watched basketball according to the second statement. But we already know that Jen did not watch basketball. So, it follows that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: Yes",

            "content": "First, let's look at the statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This is an example of a conditional statement. In a conditional statement \"if p, then q,\" the only situation where the statement is false is when p is true and q is false. In all other cases, the statement is true. \n\nNow, let's consider the original statement \"Jen did not watch basketball.\" This is a straightforward negative statement.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that if Tom watched football (p), then Jen watched basketball (q). Now if Jen did not watch basketball (~q), we can conclude that Tom did not watch football (~p). This is based on the logical relationship between the original conditional statement and the negation of its consequent.\n\nSo, based on the given information \"Jen did not watch basketball\" together with \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball,\" we can infer \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
