In this case, if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n\nNow, let's combine this with the statement \"The pants were not denim.\" This tells us that the pants were not denim, which means the consequent of the conditional statement is false.\n\nGiven that the consequent of the conditional statement is false, we cannot make any definitive inference about the shirt being cotton or not. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if the shirt is cotton, but it does not tell us anything about the shirt if the pants are not denim.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The shirt was not cotton\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
