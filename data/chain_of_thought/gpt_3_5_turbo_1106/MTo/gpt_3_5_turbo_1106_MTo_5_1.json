            "content": "To solve this, let's first look at the statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\". This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", which translates to \"P implies Q\". In this case, P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis\". The only way for a conditional statement to be false is if the hypothesis (P) is true and the conclusion (Q) is false.\n\nGiven \"Amy did not play tennis\", we know that Q is false. So, if P (Jeff played basketball) were true, the conditional statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" would be false, which is not allowed. Therefore, P (Jeff played basketball) must be false as well.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that \"Jeff did not play basketball\".\n\nAnswer: yes",

The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" Applying this to the given conditional statement, we get \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n\nNow we have the statement \"Amy did not play tennis\" and its contrapositive \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\" Combining these two statements, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball based on the original statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
