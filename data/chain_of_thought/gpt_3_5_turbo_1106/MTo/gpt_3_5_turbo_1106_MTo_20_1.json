We can also represent it as \"If P, then Q\" where P represents \"the apple is red\" and Q represents \"the banana is yellow.\"\n\nNow, looking at the statement \"The banana was not yellow,\" we can infer the negation of Q: \"The banana was yellow\" is false, so \"The banana was not yellow\" is true. This is represented as \u00acQ.\n\nFrom these two statements, if the apple was red (P), then the banana was yellow (Q), and since the banana was not yellow (\u00acQ), we can infer that the apple was not red (\u00acP).\n\nSo, considering all of this information, can we infer \"The apple was not red\"?\n\nAnswer: yes",
