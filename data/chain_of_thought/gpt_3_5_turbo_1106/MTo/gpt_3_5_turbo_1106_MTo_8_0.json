It tells us that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake.\n\nNow, let's use these two statements to see if we can infer \"The vampire was not awake.\"\n\nIf the mummy was not awake, then it means the condition \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" was not met. This means the antecedent of the conditional statement (the vampire being awake) did not occur.\n\nSo, can we infer \"The vampire was not awake\" based on the given information?\n\nAnswer: yes",
