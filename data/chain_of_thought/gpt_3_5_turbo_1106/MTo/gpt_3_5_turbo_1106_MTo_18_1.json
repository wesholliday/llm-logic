However, we know that the truck was not metal, so the antecedent of the conditional statement is false, and therefore the whole statement is considered true.\n\nNow, if the \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" statement is true and we know that the truck was not metal, it leads us to the conclusion that the doll was not plastic.\n\nNow the question is: Can we infer \"The doll was not plastic\"?\n\nAnswer: Yes",
