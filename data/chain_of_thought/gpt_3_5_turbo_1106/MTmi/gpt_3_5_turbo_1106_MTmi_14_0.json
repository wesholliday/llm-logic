This means that if the wolf was not in the den, then the bear could not have been in the cave.\n\nFrom statement 2, we are given that the wolf might not have been in the den, which means it's possible that the wolf was not in the den.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that it's possible that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes",
