This means if the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nGiven that \u00acR is true (the robot might not have visited Jupiter), we can infer that \u00acA is true (the alien did not visit Mars).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer \"The alien did not visit Mars\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
