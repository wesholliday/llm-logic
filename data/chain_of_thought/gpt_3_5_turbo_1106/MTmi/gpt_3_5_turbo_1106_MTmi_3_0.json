This is because the first statement establishes a conditional relationship between James being the author and the book being a mystery novel. The second statement suggests that the book might not be a mystery novel, which means it is possible that the condition \"the book was written by James\" is not met.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The book was not written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
