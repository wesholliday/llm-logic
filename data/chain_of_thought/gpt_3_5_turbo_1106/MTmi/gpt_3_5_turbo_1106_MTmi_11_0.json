The possibility that the muffins might not have been blueberry does not necessarily mean that the cake was not chocolate. It only indicates a possibility, but it does not provide enough information to conclude that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The cake was not chocolate\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
