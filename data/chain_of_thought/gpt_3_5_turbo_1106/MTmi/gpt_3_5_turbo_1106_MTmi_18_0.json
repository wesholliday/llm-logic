This means if the doll is not plastic, we cannot conclude anything about the truck.\n\n- The statement \"The truck might not have been metal\" does not provide any information about the doll.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we cannot infer \"The doll was not plastic\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
