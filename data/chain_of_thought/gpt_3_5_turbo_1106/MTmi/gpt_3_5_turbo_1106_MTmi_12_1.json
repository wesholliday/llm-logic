So we have \"If A, then B\", where A represents \"Joe went to the park\" and B represents \"Lucy went to the zoo\".\n\nNow, the second statement \"Lucy might not have gone to the zoo\" can be expressed as \"It is possible that not B\".\n\nTo find out if we can infer \"Joe did not go to the park\" from these statements, we can use the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\".\n\nSo if \"Lucy might not have gone to the zoo\" can be expressed as \"It is possible that not B\", then we have \"It is possible that not B\", which is equivalent to \"not B\". Following the contrapositive, this implies \"not A\", which means \"Joe did not go to the park\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
