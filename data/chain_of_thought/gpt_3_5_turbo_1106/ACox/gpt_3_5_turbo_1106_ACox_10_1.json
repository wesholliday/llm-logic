The second statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" gives us a conditional statement.\n\nNow, using the two statements, we can apply modus ponens, a valid form of argument. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement in the form \"if P, then Q\" and we also know that P is true, then we can infer that Q is true.\n\nGiven this, if we apply modus ponens to the conditional statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" and the fact \"The wug was garpled,\" we can infer \"The wug was sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
