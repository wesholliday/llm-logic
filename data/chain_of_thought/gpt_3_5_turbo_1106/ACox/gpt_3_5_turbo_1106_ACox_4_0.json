According to this law, if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we also have \"A\", then we can infer \"B\". In this case, \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\" is the conditional statement, and \"The fribble crinked\" is the fact that A is true. Therefore, we can infer \"The fribble was snurgled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
