Then, according to the first premise, it must be ringing in the kitchen. However, the second premise states that it's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen, which contradicts our initial assumption. \n\nTherefore, the only remaining possibility is that the phone is in the living room. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
