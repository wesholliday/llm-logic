If we assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false, we can check if this leads to a contradiction. \n\nAssuming the first premise 'Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom' is true, and the second premise 'It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom' is also true, then the conclusion 'The cat is napping on the couch' logically follows. This is because if it's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom, then the only remaining option from the first premise is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
