The first premise is a disjunction (either/or statement), and the second premise is the negation of the second disjunct. This allows us to use the rule of disjunctive syllogism, which states that if we have a disjunction and the negation of one of the disjuncts, we can infer the other disjunct.\n\nGiven that the premises allow us to use the disjunctive syllogism, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
