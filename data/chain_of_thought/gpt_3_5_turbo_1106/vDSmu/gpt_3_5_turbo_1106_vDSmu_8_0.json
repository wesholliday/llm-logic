This means that both premises are true (the remote control is either on the coffee table or hiding under the couch, and it's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch), but the conclusion (the remote control is on the coffee table) is false.\n\nIf the premises are true and the conclusion is false, it leads to a contradiction. This means that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
