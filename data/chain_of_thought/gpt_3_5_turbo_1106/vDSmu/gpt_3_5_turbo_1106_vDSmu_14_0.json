Then, according to the first premise, it must be chilling in the fridge. However, the second premise states that it's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge, which contradicts our initial assumption. \n\nTherefore, the only remaining possibility is that the milk is on the counter. \n\nAnswer: Yes",
