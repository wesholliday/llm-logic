If we assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false, we can check if that leads to a contradiction.\n\n1. Assume the first premise 'Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet' is true.\n2. Assume the second premise 'It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet' is true.\n3. Assume the conclusion 'The jacket is draped over the chair' is false.\n\nIf the conclusion is false, then the only remaining possibility is that the jacket must be hanging in the closet. However, this contradicts the second premise. Therefore, the conclusion must be true, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
