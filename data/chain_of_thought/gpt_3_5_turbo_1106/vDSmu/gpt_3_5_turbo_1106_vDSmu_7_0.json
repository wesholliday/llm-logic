This means that the umbrella is not in the car. \n\nNow, if the umbrella is not in the car, then the first premise 'Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet' is false, because the umbrella is not in the car. \n\nHowever, the second premise 'It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet' is true, as it directly states that the umbrella is not in the closet. \n\nThis leads to a contradiction, as both premises cannot be true while the conclusion is false. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
