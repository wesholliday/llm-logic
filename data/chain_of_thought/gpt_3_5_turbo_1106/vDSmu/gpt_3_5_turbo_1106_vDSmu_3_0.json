If we assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false, we can check if this leads to a contradiction. \n\n1. Assume the keys are not in the drawer.\n2. From the first premise, if the keys are not in the drawer, then they must be dangling in the cabinet.\n3. But the second premise states that it's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet, which contradicts our assumption from the first premise.\n4. Therefore, the assumption that the keys are not in the drawer leads to a contradiction.\n\nSince assuming the negation of the conclusion leads to a contradiction, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
