This means that the scarf is not stuffed in the backpack. \n\nIf the scarf is not stuffed in the backpack, then it must be draped on the coat rack according to the first premise. \n\nHowever, the second premise states that it's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack, which contradicts our previous conclusion.\n\nTherefore, if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
