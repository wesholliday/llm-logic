If we assume that both premises are true and the conclusion is false, we can check if this leads to a contradiction.\n\nAssuming the first premise 'Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry' is true, and the second premise 'It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry' is also true, then the only remaining possibility is that 'The cookies are in the jar'. \n\nSo, if we assume the premises are true and the conclusion is false, it leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
