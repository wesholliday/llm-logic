Then, we use the first premise 'Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head' to conclude that the sunglasses must be perched on her head. \n\nHowever, the second premise states 'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head', which contradicts our previous conclusion. \n\nTherefore, the assumption that the conclusion is false leads to a contradiction, which means the original argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
