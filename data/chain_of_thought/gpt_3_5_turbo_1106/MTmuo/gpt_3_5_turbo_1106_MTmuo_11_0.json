If the cake was chocolate, then by the second statement, the muffins must have been blueberry. However, the first statement says that it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The cake was not chocolate.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
