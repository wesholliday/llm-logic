Assume the opposite, that is, assume the shirt was cotton (Shirt was cotton). Then, using the second statement, we have (Shirt was cotton) \u2192 (Pants must have been denim). However, the first statement tells us \u00ac(Pants must have been denim). This leads to a contradiction, as it would mean that the shirt was cotton and the pants were not denim, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
