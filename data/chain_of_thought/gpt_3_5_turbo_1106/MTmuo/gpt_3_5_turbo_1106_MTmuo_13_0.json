Then, using the second statement, we have (car was red) \u2192 (truck must have been blue). However, this contradicts the first statement \u00ac(truck must have been blue).\n\nTherefore, the assumption that the car was red leads to a contradiction, so we can infer that \"The car was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
