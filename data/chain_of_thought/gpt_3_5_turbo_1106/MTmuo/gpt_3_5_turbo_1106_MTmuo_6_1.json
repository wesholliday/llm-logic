The first statement tells us that it's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta, which can be written as \u00acP.\n2. The second statement tells us that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta, which can be written as S \u2192 P.\n\nUsing these two statements, we want to determine if we can infer \"Sue did not choose pizza\".\n\nTo infer that \"Sue did not choose pizza\", we would need to have S \u2192 \u00acS, which is the same as \u00acS \u2228 \u00acS (by the material implication, S \u2192 P is equivalent to \u00acS \u2228 P).
