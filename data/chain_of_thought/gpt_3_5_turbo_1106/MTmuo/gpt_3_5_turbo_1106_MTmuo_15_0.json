Then, according to the second statement, Erin must have taken a train (Erin took a train). However, the first statement says that it's not the case that Erin must have taken a train (\u00ac(Erin took a train)). This leads to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that Sam took a plane leads to a contradiction, so we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
