Suppose that the car was red, then from the second statement, the truck must have been blue. However, the first statement says that it's not the case that the truck must have been blue, which contradicts the previous conclusion. Therefore, the assumption that the car was red leads to a contradiction.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can conclude that \"The car was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
