If we assume Mary was at the wedding, we must conclude that Sue was at the wedding, based on the second statement. This means that ~Sue must have been at the wedding is false, which in turn makes Sue must have been at the wedding true.\n\nSince both ~Sue must have been at the wedding and Sue must have been at the wedding cannot be true at the same time, we know that our assumption, Mary at the wedding, leads to a contradiction. Therefore, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nNow, based on this analysis, the answer to your question is: Answer: yes",
