Assume that the doll was plastic, represented as D. This leads to the premise D --> M, which means the truck must have been metal. But the first premise states that it is not necessary for the truck to have been metal, represented as \u00ac(T --> M). This contradicts the assumption that the doll was plastic. Therefore, by contradiction, we can infer that the doll was not plastic, represented as \u00acD.\n\nIn summary, the given premises logically entail \"The doll was not plastic.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
