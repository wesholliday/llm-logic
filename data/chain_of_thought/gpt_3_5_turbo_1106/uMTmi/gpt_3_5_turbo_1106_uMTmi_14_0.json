If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\n2. The wolf might not have been in the den.\n\nFrom the given information, we can infer that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den. However, the second statement introduces uncertainty about the wolf's location. It does not confirm whether the wolf was in the den or not.\n\nGiven this, we cannot infer that the bear was not in the cave, as there is still a possibility that the bear was in the cave and the wolf was in the den.\n\nAnswer: no",
