The unicorn might not have been in the forest.\n\nFrom the first statement, if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest. However, the second statement introduces uncertainty about the unicorn's location.\n\nGiven this information, we cannot infer that the griffin was not in the forest. The possibility remains that the griffin was in the forest, and the unicorn may or may not have been there as well.\n\nAnswer: no",
