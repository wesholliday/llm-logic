It tells us that the pen is either on the desk or in the bag.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can infer that if the pen is not on the desk and it must be either on the desk or in the bag, then it must be in the bag.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can infer \"The pen is in my bag.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
