The original statement is in the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin took a train.\"\n\nFrom the original statement, we can infer the contrapositive, which is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In this case, it would be \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the contrapositive statement. If Erin did not take a train, it does not necessarily mean that Sam did not take a plane. Sam could have taken a plane or another mode of transportation. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: no",
