This is a conditional statement, where the first part is the antecedent (if Joe went to the park) and the second part is the consequent (then Lucy went to the zoo).\n\nNow, let's consider the inverse of the original statement: If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park. This is the inverse of the original conditional statement.\n\nIn logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
