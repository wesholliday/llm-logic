The original statement is in the form \"If A then B,\" where A is \"Sue chose pizza\" and B is \"Bob chose pasta.\" This statement does not imply that the reverse is true, meaning it does not necessarily follow that if B (\"Bob chose pasta\"), then A (\"Sue chose pizza\"). \n\nIn logic, just because A implies B, does not mean that B implies A. To illustrate, if we have \"If it is raining, then the streets are wet,\" it does not mean that \"If the streets are wet, then it is raining.\" The streets could be wet for other reasons, such as a recent washing or a burst water pipe.\n\nSo, based on the original statement, we cannot infer that if Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza.\n\nAnswer: no",
