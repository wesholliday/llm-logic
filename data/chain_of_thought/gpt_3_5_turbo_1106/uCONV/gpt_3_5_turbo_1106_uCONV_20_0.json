In logic, the reverse of a conditional statement is not always true. However, if the original statement is also a biconditional statement (meaning the antecedent and consequent are interchangeable), then the reverse would be true.\n\nSo, to determine if the reverse statement is true, we need to know if the original statement is a biconditional statement or not. If it is not a biconditional statement, we cannot infer the reverse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
