The statement asserts that if the antecedent (vampire awake) is true, then the consequent (mummy awake) must also be true.\n\nNow, to determine if we can infer the reverse statement, \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake,\" we need to consider the original conditional statement and its converse.\n\nThe converse of the original statement is \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.\"\n\nTo determine if the converse is true, we need to consider if the original conditional statement guarantees the truth of its converse.\n\nAnswer: no",
