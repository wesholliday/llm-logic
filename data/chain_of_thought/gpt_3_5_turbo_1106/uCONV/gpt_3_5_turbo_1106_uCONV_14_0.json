In logic, the reverse of a conditional statement is not always true. The reverse statement would be \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the cave.\"\n\nTo determine if this reverse statement is true, we need more information about the relationship between the wolf and the bear. Without additional information, we cannot infer that if the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the cave.\n\nAnswer: no",
