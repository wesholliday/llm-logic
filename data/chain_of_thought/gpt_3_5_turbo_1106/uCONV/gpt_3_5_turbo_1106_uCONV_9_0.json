This is a conditional statement, where the first part is the antecedent (if Lisa bought the red shirt) and the second part is the consequent (then Mark bought the blue shirt).\n\nNow, let's consider the inverse of the original statement. If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt. This is the inverse of the original conditional statement.\n\nIn logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
