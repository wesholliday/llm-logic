Bear in cave -> Wolf in den\n2. Wolf in den -> ?\n\nWe want to see if we can reverse the logic from the first statement to infer the second statement.\n\nIn logic, the reverse relationship of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. In other words, just because \"A implies B\" does not mean \"B implies A.\"\n\nSo, we cannot directly infer that if the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the cave based on the given conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
