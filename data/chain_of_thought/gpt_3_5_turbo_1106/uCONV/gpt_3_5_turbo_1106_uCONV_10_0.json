The original statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" is a conditional statement. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the cat was outside, then the dog was inside based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
