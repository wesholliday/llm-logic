If the original statement is true, then we can infer the reverse statement. However, if the original statement is false, we cannot infer the reverse statement.\n\nSo, we need to know if the car was red and the truck was blue to determine the validity of the original statement. If we have this information, we can proceed to infer the reverse statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
