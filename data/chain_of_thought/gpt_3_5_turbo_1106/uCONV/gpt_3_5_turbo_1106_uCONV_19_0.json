Just because Tom watching football implies Jen watching basketball, it does not mean that Jen watching basketball implies Tom watching football. This is because the original statement does not establish a biconditional relationship (if and only if) between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football.\n\nAnswer: no",
