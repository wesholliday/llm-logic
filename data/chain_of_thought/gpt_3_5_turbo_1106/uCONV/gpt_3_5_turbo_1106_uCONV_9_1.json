However, it is possible to infer that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt based on the original statement alone. This is because the original statement implies a one-to-one relationship - if one thing happens, then the other thing also happens. Therefore, if Mark bought the blue shirt, it implies that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
