However, it does not necessarily mean that if Sue attended, then Mary must have attended.\n\nTo illustrate this, consider that Mary and Sue could have attended the wedding together, but it's also possible that Sue attended for a different reason or with someone else, unrelated to Mary's attendance. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
