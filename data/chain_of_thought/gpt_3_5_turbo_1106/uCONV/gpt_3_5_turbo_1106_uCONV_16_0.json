The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\" \n\nSo, if we can infer that the pants were denim, then we can also infer that the shirt was cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
