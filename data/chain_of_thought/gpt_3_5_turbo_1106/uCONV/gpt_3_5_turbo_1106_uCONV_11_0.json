The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the condition and the result and then reversing their order.\n\nSo, the contrapositive of \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\"\n\nNow, let's consider if the contrapositive statement is true based on the original statement. If the muffins were not blueberry, it doesn't necessarily mean that the cake was not chocolate, as there could be other flavors of muffins. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
