The contrapositive of \"if A, then B\" is \"if not B, then not A.\"\n\nSo, the contrapositive of the original statement is \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the contrapositive statement in relation to the original question. If the robot did not visit Jupiter, we cannot conclude anything about the alien's visit to Mars based on the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: no",
