The converse of the original statement is \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.\"\n\nTo determine if the converse is true, we need to consider if the original statement guarantees the truth of the converse. In this case, the original statement does not guarantee the truth of the converse. It is possible that the truck is metal for reasons other than the doll being plastic.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: no",
