So, if the scarf is not draped on the coat rack, then it must be stuffed in the backpack.\n\nConsidering these two statements, we can infer that \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack\", as the second statement allows for this conclusion based on the first statement.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: \nAnswer: yes",
