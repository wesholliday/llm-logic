This means that if one statement is true, the other must be false. \n\nLet's start with the first statement \"The watch might not be on his wrist.\" This indicates uncertainty about the location of the watch.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\" This establishes a mutually exclusive relationship, suggesting that if the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser.\n\nGiven these two statements, the conclusion \"The watch is charging on the dresser\" can be validly inferred.\n\nAnswer: yes",
