In this case, it means that it is possible for the snork to be in the wibble, or it is possible for the snork to be on the quank, or it is possible for the snork to be in both the wibble and on the quank. Therefore, we can infer that \"The snork might be in the wibble or it might be on the quank\" is a valid interpretation of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
