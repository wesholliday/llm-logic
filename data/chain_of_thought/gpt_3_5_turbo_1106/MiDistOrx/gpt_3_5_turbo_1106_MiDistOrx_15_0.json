When we rephrase it as \"The quazzle might be quibble grazzle glorp or it might be flibbit,\" we are essentially restating the original statement in a different way, emphasizing that the quazzle could be any of the listed options, including flibbit. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
