Then, the statement \"The sprocket is not daggled\" can be represented as \"\u00acD\". Using these, we can infer \"S \u2192 C\" if we assume the original statement holds true.\n\nNow we can use the rules of inference. Firstly, we can use disjunctive syllogism on the original statement \"(S \u2192 D) \u2228 (S \u2192 C)\" and \"\u00acD\" to derive \"S \u2192 C\".
