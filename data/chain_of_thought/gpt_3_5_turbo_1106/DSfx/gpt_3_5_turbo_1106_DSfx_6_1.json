We are asked if we can infer \"The grommet is sploffed\" given the first two pieces of information.\n\nNow, let\u2019s consider the implications of the given statements:\n- The first statement tells us that the grommet could either be plopped or sploffed, but not both.\n- The second statement tells us that the grommet is not plopped.\n\nCombining the two statements, we cannot definitively infer that the grommet is sploffed because it could be true that the grommet is sploffed, or it could be something else altogether. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The grommet is sploffed\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
