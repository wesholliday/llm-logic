From the statement 'Either the wug is garpled or it is sproinged' (P or Q) and the statement 'The wug is not garpled' (\u00acP), we can make use of the rule of modus tollens. This rule states that if we have a conditional statement P implies Q (P \u2192 Q), and the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ), then we can infer the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP). In this case, we have 'Either the wug is garpled or it is sproinged' (P or Q), so if we know that the wug is not garpled (\u00acP), we can infer that 'The wug is sproinged' (Q).\n\nNow, let's use modus tollens to check if the inference is valid.\n\nStatement 1: Either the wug is garpled or it is sproinged (P or Q)\nStatement 2: The wug is not garpled (\u00acP)\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer: 'The wug is sproinged' (Q).\n\nTherefore, the inference is valid.",
