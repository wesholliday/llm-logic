This is because if the clug is not in the snugged state, and the disjunction statement tells us that it must be in one of the two states (snugged or fleeked), then it follows that it must be in the fleeked state.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The clug is fleeked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
