This is based on the logic of \"either/or\" statements.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that there is a possibility that the splat is not quanked.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can conclude that if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed. However, we cannot definitively infer that the splat is morphed without more information.\n\nAnswer: no",
