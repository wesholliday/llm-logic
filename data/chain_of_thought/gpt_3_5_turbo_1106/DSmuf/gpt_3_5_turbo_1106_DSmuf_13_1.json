This rule states that if we have a conditional statement \"if P then Q\" and we know that Q is false, then we can infer that P is also false.\n\n1. \"Either the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf or it is in the toy box\" can be represented as P v Q, where P is \"the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" and Q is \"the toy is in the toy box\".\n2. \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" can be represented as \u00acP.\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer that if Q is true, then P must be true.
