If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nWe want to infer whether \"The truck was not metal\" based on the given information.\n\nIf the doll was not plastic, it means the doll was made of a material other than plastic. Given the conditional statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\", we can infer that since the doll was not plastic, the consequent of the conditional statement (the truck was metal) does not necessarily need to apply.\n\nThis leaves us with two possibilities: \na) The truck could be metal or not metal.\nb) We cannot be certain whether the truck was metal or not metal.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer \"The truck was not metal.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
