It means if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n- If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then the conditional statement does not apply, and we cannot infer anything about Mark buying the blue shirt.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot infer whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
