It means if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n- If Sam did not take a plane, we cannot directly infer anything about Erin's mode of transportation based on the given information. This is because the conditional statement only applies if Sam took a plane.\n\nGiven this analysis, we cannot infer \"Erin did not take a train\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
