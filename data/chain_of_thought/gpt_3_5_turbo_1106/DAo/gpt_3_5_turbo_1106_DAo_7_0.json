The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In this case, it would be \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\nGiven the original statement \"Alex did not finish the race,\" we can use the contrapositive to infer that \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\" However, this does not directly lead to the conclusion that \"Chris did not finish the race.\"\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot directly infer that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
