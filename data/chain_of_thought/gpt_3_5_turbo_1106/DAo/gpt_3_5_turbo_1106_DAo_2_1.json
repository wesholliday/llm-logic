The statement can be symbolized as \u00acP \u2228 Q (not P or Q), which means either the griffin was not in the forest or the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nNow, if we combine \"The griffin was not in the forest\" (\u00acP) with the disjunction from the second statement (\u00acP \u2228 Q), we can infer that the unicorn was in the forest (Q).
