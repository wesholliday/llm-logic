We can do this by considering the contrapositive of the conditional statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\".\n\nSo, if we combine \"The apple was not red\" with the contrapositive of the conditional statement, we can infer \"The banana was not yellow\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
