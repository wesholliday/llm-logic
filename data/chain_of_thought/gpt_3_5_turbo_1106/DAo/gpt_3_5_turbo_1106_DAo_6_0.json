If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\n\nFrom the given information, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza. Then, using the second statement, if Sue did not choose pizza, we cannot make any inference about what Bob chose, as the conditional statement only applies if Sue chose pizza.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer whether Bob chose pasta or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
