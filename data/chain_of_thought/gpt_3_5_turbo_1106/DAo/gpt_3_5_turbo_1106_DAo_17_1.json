It states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\n\nNow, let's see if we can infer the statement \"Kate did not eat salad\" from the given information. We know that Ben did not eat pasta, and from the conditional statement, we can't make a direct inference about Kate's eating habits unless we know whether or not Ben ate pasta. So, without knowing whether Ben actually ate pasta, we cannot make the inference that Kate did not eat salad.\n\nAnswer: no",
