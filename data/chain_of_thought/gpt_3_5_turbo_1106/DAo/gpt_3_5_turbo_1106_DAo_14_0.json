The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nNow, let's apply the contrapositive to the given statement: \"If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nSo, if the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave. This means that we can infer \"The bear was not in the cave\" from \"The wolf was not in the den.\"\n\nNow, let's answer the question.",
