It means if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n\nNow, let's combine the two statements:\n- If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n- The dog was not inside (i.e., the dog was outside).\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the cat was not necessarily outside. This is because the conditional statement only tells us what happens if the dog was inside, but it doesn't tell us anything about the cat when the dog is outside.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The cat was not outside\" from the given statements.",
