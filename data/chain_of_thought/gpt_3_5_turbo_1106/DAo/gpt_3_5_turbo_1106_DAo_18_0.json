It tells us that if the doll was made of plastic, then the truck was made of metal.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\nIf the doll was not plastic, then the conditional statement does not provide any information about the truck. This is because the condition \"if the doll was plastic\" is not met, so we cannot draw any conclusions about the truck.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The truck was not metal\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
