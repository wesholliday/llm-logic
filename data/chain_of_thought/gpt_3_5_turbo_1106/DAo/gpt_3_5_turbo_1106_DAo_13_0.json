It tells us that if the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\nIf the car was not red, then the conditional statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" does not provide any information about the color of the truck, because the antecedent (the car being red) is not true.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we cannot infer the color of the truck.\n\nAnswer: no",
