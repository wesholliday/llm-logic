This is because the conditional statement only tells us about the situation when the griffin is in the forest, but it does not provide information about the situation when the griffin is not in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The unicorn was not in the forest\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
