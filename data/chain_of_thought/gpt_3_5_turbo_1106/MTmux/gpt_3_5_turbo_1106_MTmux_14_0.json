The contrapositive of \"F -> S\" is \"~S -> ~F\" (where ~S stands for \"it's not the case that the clug must have been snugged\" and ~F stands for \"the clug was not fleeked\").\n\nSo, if we combine the contrapositive of the first statement with the second statement, we get \"~S\" and \"~S -> ~F\", which allows us to infer \"~F\" (the clug was not fleeked).\n\nAnswer: yes",
