In this case, the statement \"The wumble might be plonk flump\" does not necessarily imply \"The wumble might be plonk flump and snork zibber quank.\" The addition of \"and snork zibber quank\" introduces new information that is not necessarily implied by the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The wumble might be plonk flump and snork zibber quank\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
