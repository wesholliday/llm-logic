The contrapositive of \"If p, then q\" is \"If not q, then not p.\" So, the contrapositive of the original statement is \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the contrapositive in relation to the original question. If we have the contrapositive \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park,\" and we negate the first part of the implication, it would become \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\" \n\nThis new statement is not equivalent to the statement \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" Therefore, we cannot infer the given statement from the original conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
