The first statement is a conditional statement, which means it has the form \"if p, then q.\" The second statement is the contrapositive of the first statement, which is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den, we can infer that if the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\n\nAnswer: yes",
