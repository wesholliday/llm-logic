The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"if p, then q\" is \"if not q, then not p.\"\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the original statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\"\n\nSo, the statement \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\" is not the contrapositive of the original statement. Therefore, we cannot directly infer it from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
