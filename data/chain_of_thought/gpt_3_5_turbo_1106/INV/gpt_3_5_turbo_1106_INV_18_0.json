            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal\" from the given statement, let's consider the logical relationship between the original statement and the inferred statement.\n\nThe original statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal\".\n\nThe inferred statement \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal\" can be represented as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, where \u00acP is \"the doll was not plastic\" and \u00acQ is \"the truck was not metal\".\n\nTo determine if the inferred statement is valid, we can use the contrapositive of the original statement, which is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. If the contrapositive is true, then the inferred statement is also true.\n\nLet's check if the contrapositive \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP is true based on the original statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\". If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic. This seems to be a valid inference based on the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
