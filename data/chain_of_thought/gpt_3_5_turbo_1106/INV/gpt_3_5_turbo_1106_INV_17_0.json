            "content": "First, let's consider the original statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This is a conditional statement in the form \"if p, then q.\" In this case, p represents \"Ben ate pasta\" and q represents \"Kate ate salad.\"\n\nThe inference \"If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad\" is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"if p, then q\" is \"if not q, then not p.\"\n\nTo determine if the inference is valid, we can use the logical equivalence of a conditional statement and its contrapositive. In other words, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent.\n\nSo, if the original statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
