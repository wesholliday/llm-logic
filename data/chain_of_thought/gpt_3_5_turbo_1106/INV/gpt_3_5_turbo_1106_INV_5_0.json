The contrapositive of \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\" \n\nNow, let's compare the original statement with its contrapositive. If the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. If the original statement is false, then its contrapositive is also false.\n\nGiven that the original statement is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis,\" we cannot infer the statement \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis\" without additional information. This is because the original statement does not provide information about what happens if Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis\" from the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
