The contrapositive of \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\" \n\nNow, let's compare the original statement with its contrapositive to see if they are equivalent. If they are, then the inference is valid.\n\nOriginal statement: If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\nContrapositive: If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\n\nBy comparing the original statement with its contrapositive, we can see that they are equivalent. Therefore, the inference \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\" is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
