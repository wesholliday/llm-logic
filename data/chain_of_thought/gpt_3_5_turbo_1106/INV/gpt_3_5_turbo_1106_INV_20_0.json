The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If p, then q\" is \"If not q, then not p.\"\n\nSo, the contrapositive of \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\"\n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive with the statement \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\" If the contrapositive matches the given statement, then we can infer the given statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
