The contrapositive of \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" \n\nSo, if we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement, then the answer is yes.\n\nNow, let's consider the original statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we cannot conclude anything about Mark's purchase based solely on this statement.\n\nTherefore, the second statement cannot be inferred from the first.\n\nAnswer: no",
