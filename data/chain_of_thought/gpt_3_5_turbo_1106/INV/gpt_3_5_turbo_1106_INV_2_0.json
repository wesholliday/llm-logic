            "content": "To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, let's consider the logical form of the original statement. The original statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" can be represented as \"G \u2192 U\" where G stands for \"the griffin was in the forest\" and U stands for \"the unicorn was in the forest\".\n\nNow, to infer the second statement \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest\" from the original statement, we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"G \u2192 U\" is \"\u00acU \u2192 \u00acG\" where \u00acU stands for \"the unicorn was not in the forest\" and \u00acG stands for \"the griffin was not in the forest\".\n\nSo, if the contrapositive holds true, then we can infer the second statement from the original statement.\n\nLet's check if the contrapositive holds true. If the unicorn was not in the forest (\u00acU), then we can conclude that the griffin was not in the forest (\u00acG) based on the contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: yes",
