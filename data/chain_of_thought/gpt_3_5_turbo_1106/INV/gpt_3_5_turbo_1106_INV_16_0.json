The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" \n\nSo, the contrapositive of \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive with the given statement to see if they are equivalent.\n\nGiven: If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\nContrapositive: If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\n\nBy comparing the contrapositive with the given statement, we can see that they are not equivalent. The contrapositive does not match the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
