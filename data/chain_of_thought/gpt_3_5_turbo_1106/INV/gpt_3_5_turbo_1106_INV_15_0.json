The contrapositive of \"if P, then Q\" is \"if not Q, then not P.\"\n\nSo, the contrapositive of the original statement is \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive with the statement \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\" They are not the same, so we cannot directly infer the second statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
