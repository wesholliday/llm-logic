            "content": "First, let's break down the original statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"Sue chose pizza\" and the consequent is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In this case, the contrapositive of the original statement would be \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\nSo, the question is asking if we can infer the contrapositive statement from the original statement.\n\nTo determine this, we can use the logical equivalence of a conditional statement and its contrapositive. In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, if the original statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
