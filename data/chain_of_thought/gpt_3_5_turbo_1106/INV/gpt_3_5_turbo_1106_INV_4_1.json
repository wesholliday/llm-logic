The contrapositive of \"A implies B\" is \"Not B implies not A\". This means if we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement, the inference is valid.\n\nFrom the original statement \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\", the contrapositive is \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars\".\n\nSo, if we can infer the contrapositive \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars\" from the original statement, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",

If we can prove that the contrapositive is true, then the original inference is also true.\n\nSo, if we take the contrapositive \"~R -> ~A\", it gives us \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars\". \n\nBy evaluating this, we see that the inference holds because if the robot did not visit Jupiter, according to the original statement \"A -> R\", it means that the alien did not visit Mars. \n\nTherefore, the inference \"If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter\" is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
