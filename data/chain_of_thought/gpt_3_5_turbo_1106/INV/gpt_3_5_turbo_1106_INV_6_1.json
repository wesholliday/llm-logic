            "content": "First, let's think about the logical relationship between the original statement and the inferred statement. The original statement is of the form \"if p then q\", where p is \"Sue chose pizza\" and q is \"Bob chose pasta\". The inferred statement is of the form \"if not p then not q\", where not p is \"Sue did not choose pizza\" and not q is \"Bob did not choose pasta\". \n\nNow, to determine if the inferred statement is logically valid based on the original statement, we can use the principle of contrapositive. The contrapositive of the original statement \"if p then q\" is \"if not q then not p\". \n\nTherefore, if we can show that \"if not q then not p\" is the same as the inferred statement \"if not p then not q\", then the inference is valid.\n\nLet's check:\nOriginal Statement: If p then q (If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta)\nContrapositive: If not q then not p (If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza)\n\nComparing the contrapositive with the inferred statement:\nInferred Statement: If not p then not q (If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta)\n\nBased on this comparison, we can see that the inferred statement \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta\" is equivalent to the contrapositive \"if not q then not p\", which is based on the original statement. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",

The contrapositive of \"P \u2192 Q\" is \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\". \n\nSo, if we want to infer \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\" from \"P \u2192 Q\", we can do so by using the contrapositive. \n\nNow, we can infer \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\" from \"P \u2192 Q\" using the law of contraposition. \n\nTherefore, \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta\" is a valid inference from the given conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",

This statement is the negation of the original statement, which would be \"If not P, then not Q\". \n\nTo determine if the inferred statement is valid, we can use the contrapositive rule: the contrapositive of a conditional statement P -> Q is the statement \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\nSo, we need to check if the contrapositive of the original statement matches the inferred statement \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta\".
