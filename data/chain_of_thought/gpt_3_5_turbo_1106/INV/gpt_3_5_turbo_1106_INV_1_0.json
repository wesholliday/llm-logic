The given statement is in the form of a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" In this case, the statement does not tell us anything about what happens if Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nTo infer the statement \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding,\" we would need to know the logical relationship between Mary and Sue's presence at the wedding when Mary is not there. However, the original statement does not provide this information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
