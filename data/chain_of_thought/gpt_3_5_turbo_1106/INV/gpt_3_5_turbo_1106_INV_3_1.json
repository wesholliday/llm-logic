The original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If p, then q\", where p is \"the book was written by James\" and q is \"the book is a mystery novel\". \n\nNow, the statement \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel\" is the negation of the original statement. It's important to remember that the negation of a conditional statement is not necessarily the inverse of the original statement.\n\nTo find the negation, we have to consider the original statement's truth table. In this case, the negation would be \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\". This is different from \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel\".\n\nGiven this, we cannot infer \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel\" from the original statement. \n\nAnswer: no",

The inverse of P -> Q is ~P -> ~Q. However, not all original conditional statements result in meaningful inferences when their inverses are taken.\n\nSo, let's test the inference by substituting different values for P and Q to see if the original statement always leads to the inference being true.\n\nLet's say P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel\". Now, let's consider different scenarios where P and Q have different truth values and see if they align with the inverse statement.\n\n1.
