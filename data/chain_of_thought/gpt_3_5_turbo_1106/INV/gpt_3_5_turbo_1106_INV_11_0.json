The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If p, then q\" is \"If not q, then not p.\"\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the given statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\"\n\nSo, the statement \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\" can be inferred from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
