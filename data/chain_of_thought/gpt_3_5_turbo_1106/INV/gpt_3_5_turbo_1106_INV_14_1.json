If the original statement is 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den', we can infer the contrapositive by negating both the antecedent and the consequent. \n\nNegating the original statement, 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den', yields 'If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.' Therefore, the contrapositive of the original statement is indeed 'If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.'\n\nSo, the inference holds true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
