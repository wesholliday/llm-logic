Start with the assumption that the fribble is not snurgled.\n2. Then, based on the given statements, if the fribble is not snurgled, it must be crinked by the second statement - 'Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked'.\n3. However, the first statement states 'The fribble might not be crinked', which contradicts the previous inference that the fribble must be crinked if it is not snurgled.\n4. Therefore, the assumption that the fribble is not snurgled leads to a contradiction.\n5. Thus, we can infer that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
