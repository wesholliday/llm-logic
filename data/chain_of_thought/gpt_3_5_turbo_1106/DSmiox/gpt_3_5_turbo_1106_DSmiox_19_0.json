From statement 2, we know that either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged.\n\nGiven this information, we cannot infer that \"The smonk is vreebled\" because we don't have enough information to determine whether the smonk is vreebled or not. The only information we have is that it might not be plagged and that it must be either vreebled or plagged, but we don't have enough information to conclude that it is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: no",
