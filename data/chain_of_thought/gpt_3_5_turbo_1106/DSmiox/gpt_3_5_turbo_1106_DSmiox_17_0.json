From statement 2, we know that if the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot directly infer that \"The flob is skizzled.\" This is because we don't have enough information to determine whether the flob is actually not movated. It's only a possibility based on the first statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
