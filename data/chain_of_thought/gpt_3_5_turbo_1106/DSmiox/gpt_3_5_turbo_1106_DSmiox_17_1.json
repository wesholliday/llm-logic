This statement does not give a definite answer about the state of the flob. It only allows for the possibility that the flob is not movated, meaning we cannot definitively conclude that the flob is skizzled based on this information alone.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can see that we cannot infer \"The flob is skizzled\" from the two original statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
