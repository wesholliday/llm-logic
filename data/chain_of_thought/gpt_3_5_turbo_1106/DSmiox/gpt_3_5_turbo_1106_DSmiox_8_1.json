It only indicates the possibility that the sprocket might not be daggled. Therefore, we cannot immediately conclude that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nNow, let's compare the first and the combined statement. We will get 'The sprocket might not be daggled' AND 'Either the sprocket is cranked or it might not be daggled'. This implies that the sprocket might not be daggled.
