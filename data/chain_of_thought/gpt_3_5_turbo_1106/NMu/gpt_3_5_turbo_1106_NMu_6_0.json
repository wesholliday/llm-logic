The original statement \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" can be rewritten as \"It's possible that Sue did not choose pizza.\" This means that Sue might not have chosen pizza. Therefore, we can infer \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
