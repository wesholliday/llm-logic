The original statement can be rewritten as \"It's not necessary that the notebook is in the drawer.\" If it's not necessary for the notebook to be in the drawer, then it is possible that the notebook is not in the drawer. Therefore, we can infer \"The notebook might not be in the drawer.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
