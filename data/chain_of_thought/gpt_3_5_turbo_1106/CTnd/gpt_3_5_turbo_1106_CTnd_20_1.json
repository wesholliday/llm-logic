The first statement can be translated into a conditional statement: \"If a recommendation was made, then it was not a strong recommendation.\" This can be written as \"R \u2192 \u00acS\" where R represents \"a recommendation was made\" and S represents \"it was a strong recommendation.\"\n\nTo infer the second statement \"If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made,\" we need to look for its logical equivalent. By manipulating the first statement, we can find its contrapositive: \"If S, then \u00acR.\" \n\nNow, if we analyze the meaning of the contrapositive statement, it says that if a strong recommendation was made (S), then a recommendation was not made (\u00acR). This seems to contradict common sense, as a strong recommendation should still be a type of recommendation. Given this contradiction, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: no",
