The original statement \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much\" can be represented as \"A -> ~B\" where A represents \"Alex exercised\" and ~B represents \"he did not exercise much\".\n\nNow, we want to infer the statement \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise\", which can be represented as \"B -> ~A\" where B represents \"Alex exercised much\" and ~A represents \"he did not exercise\".\n\nTo infer the second statement from the first, we can use the contrapositive of the original statement, which is \"~(~B) -> ~A\" or \"B -> ~A\". This means that if Alex did not exercise much, then he did exercise. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
