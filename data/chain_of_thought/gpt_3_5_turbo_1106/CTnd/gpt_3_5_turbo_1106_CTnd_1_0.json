The contrapositive of \"If p, then q\" is \"If not q, then not p.\" \n\nSo, the contrapositive of \"If it's raining, then it's not raining hard\" is \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining.\" \n\nTherefore, we can infer the statement \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
