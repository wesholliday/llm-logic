Now, when we apply the contrapositive to this statement, we get 'If it's raining hard, then it's not raining'. \n\nThe contrapositive of a statement maintains its truth value relative to the original statement. So, if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true, and if the original statement is false, its contrapositive is also false. \n\nAnswer: yes",
