The contrapositive of \"If the meal was prepared, then it was not prepared carefully\" is \"If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared.\" This is because the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we can infer the statement \"If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
