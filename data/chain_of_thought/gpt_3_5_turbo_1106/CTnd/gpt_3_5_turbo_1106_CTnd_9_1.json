The original statement is \"If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly.\" Let's denote instructions given as G and instructions explained clearly as E.\n\nThe original statement can be represented as: G -> \u00acE, which means \"If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly.\"\n\nNow, the proposed inference is: \u00acE -> \u00acG, which means \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given.\"\n\nTo test the inference, let's consider a scenario where instructions were not given at all. In this case, both the original statement and the proposed inference are true. However, we want to check if the inference holds in all cases.\n\nIn general, the inference \u00acE -> \u00acG doesn't hold because it's possible for instructions to be explained clearly even if they were not given. For example, someone could explain instructions for a hypothetical situation or for a different task altogether.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \u00acE -> \u00acG from the original statement \"If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
