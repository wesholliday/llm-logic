Let's represent \"I went to the store\" with the letter W and \"I bought vegetables\" with the letter V.\n\nThe original statement \"If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables\" can be translated to W -> ~V (where -> represents \"if...then\" and ~ represents \"not\").\n\nNow, we want to infer \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store\". This can be represented as V -> ~W.\n\nTo determine if the inference is valid, let's use the transposition law of logic: P -> Q is equivalent to ~Q -> ~P.\n\nNow we can apply this law to our original statement to see if it matches the inferred statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
