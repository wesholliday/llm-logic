In this case, the first premise \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is a conditional statement, and the second premise \"Sue chose pizza\" matches the condition \"P\" in the conditional statement. Therefore, the conclusion \"Bob chose pasta\" can be validly drawn using modus ponens.\n\nAnswer: yes",
