In this case, the first premise \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" is a conditional statement, and the second premise \"The bear was in the cave\" is the condition \"P\". Therefore, based on the principle of modus ponens, the conclusion \"The wolf was in the den\" logically follows.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
