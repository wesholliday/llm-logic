Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"if P then Q\" and we also have the premise \"P\", then we can logically conclude \"Q\".\n\nIn this case, the first premise \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q\" where P is \"the dog was inside\" and Q is \"the cat was outside\". The second premise \"The dog was inside\" can be represented as \"P\".\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can logically conclude \"Q\", which in this case is \"The cat was outside\".\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.",
