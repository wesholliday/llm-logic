Then, we have the statement \"The smonk plagged\" which we can represent as \"P\". \n\nNow, to infer \"The smonk was vreebled\" from these statements, we need to check if the original statement \"V \u2192 P\" is true and if \"P\" is true. If both of these are true, then we can infer \"V\" is true.\n\nLet's check:\n- \"V \u2192 P\" is true (if the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged)\n- \"P\" is true (the smonk plagged)\n\nGiven that both \"V \u2192 P\" and \"P\" are true, we can infer \"V\" is true, so we can infer \"The smonk was vreebled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
