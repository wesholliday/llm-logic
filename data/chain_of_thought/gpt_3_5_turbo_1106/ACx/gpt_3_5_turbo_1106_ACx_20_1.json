So, in this case, if \"A implies B\" is true and \"B\" is true, then \"A\" must also be true.\n\nNow, considering the premises in context, we can apply modus ponens to the statements given:\n\n1. \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" (A -> B)\n2. \"The fleeg surned\" (B)\n\nGiven these two statements, we can logically infer that \"The fleeg was bluttered\" (A).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical relationship between the premises and the application of modus ponens, we can infer \"The fleeg was bluttered\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
