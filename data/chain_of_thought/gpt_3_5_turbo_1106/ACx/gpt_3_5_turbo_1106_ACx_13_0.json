This means that if the glip was slogged, then it must also be tragged. \n\nNext, we are given the statement \"The glip was tragged.\" \n\nBased on these two pieces of information, we can infer that the glip was slogged. This is because if the glip was slogged, then it must also be tragged, and we know that the glip was tragged.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The glip was slogged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
