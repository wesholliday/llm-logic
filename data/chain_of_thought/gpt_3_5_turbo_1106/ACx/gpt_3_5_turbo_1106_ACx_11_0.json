Given the premises \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\" and \"The flug was zimmed,\" we cannot directly infer \"The flug was blummed.\" This is because the second premise does not provide any information about the first premise. Therefore, we cannot make the inference based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
