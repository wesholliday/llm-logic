If p, then q (p -> q)\n2. q\n\nThe conclusion we want to infer is:\n3. p\n\nTo determine if we can infer statement 3 from statements 1 and 2, we can use the method of modus ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement of the form \"if p, then q\" and we have the fact that \"p\" is true, we can conclude that \"q\" is true. In this case, we want to do the reverse and infer \"p\" from \"q\" and the conditional statement \"if p, then q\". Let's use modus tollens:\n\nFrom statement 1, we have \"if p, then q\" (p -> q)\nFrom statement 2, we have q\n\nUsing modus tollens: Since q is true, then p must also be true.
