The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\" is \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\"\n\nGiven the second statement \"The shank was nugged,\" we can conclude that the shank was not not nugged, which means the shank was not plooked. Therefore, we can infer \"The shank was plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
