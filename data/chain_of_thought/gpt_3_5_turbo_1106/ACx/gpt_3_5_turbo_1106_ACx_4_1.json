The second statement \"The fribble crinked\" is an affirmation.\n\nNow, we should consider the validity of the inference. Since the given conditional statement is of the form \"if p, then q\", and the affirmation is that q is true, we can only infer that p is true if the conditional statement is known to be true.\n\nTo make the inference, we would need to know that the conditional statement \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\" is true. Without that knowledge, we cannot make the inference.\n\nConsidering this, can we infer \"The fribble was snurgled\"?",
