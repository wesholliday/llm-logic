Then, we are given the statement \"The splat quanked.\" \n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The splat was morphed,\" we need to check if the conditional statement and the given statement satisfy the condition of the conditional statement. \n\nThe conditional statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" is in the form \"If P, then Q.\" In this case, P is \"the splat was morphed\" and Q is \"the splat quanked.\"\n\nGiven that \"The splat quanked\" (Q is true), we can infer that \"The splat was morphed\" (P is true) only if the conditional statement is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
