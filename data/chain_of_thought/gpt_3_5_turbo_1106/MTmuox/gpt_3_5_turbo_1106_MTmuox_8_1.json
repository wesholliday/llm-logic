Specifically, we will use the rule of modus tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement of the form \"If p, then q\" and we know that q is false, then we can infer that p must also be false.\n\nHere's how we apply modus tollens in this case:\n\nFrom statement (2) \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled,\" we have C \u2192 D.\n\nFrom statement (1) \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled,\" we have \u00acD.\n\nNow, if we know that the sprocket must not have been daggled (\u00acD), using modus tollens, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked (\u00acC).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the application of modus tollens, we can infer \"The sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
