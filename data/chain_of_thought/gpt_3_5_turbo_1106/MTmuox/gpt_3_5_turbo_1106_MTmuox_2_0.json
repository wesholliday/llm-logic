It tells us that if the wug was flooped, then it must have bimmed the zoint.\n\nNow, let's consider the inference we want to make: \"The wug was not flooped.\"\n\nTo make this inference, we can use the contrapositive of the second statement. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nSo, the contrapositive of \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint\" is \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\"\n\nGiven the first statement \"It's not the case that the wug must have bimmed the zoint,\" we can conclude that the wug did not bim the zoint.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The wug was not flooped.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
