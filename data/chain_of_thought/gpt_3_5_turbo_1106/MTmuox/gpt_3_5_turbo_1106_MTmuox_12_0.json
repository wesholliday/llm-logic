If (smip was shripped) then (smip must have lupped the zoint)\n\nNow, let's use the second statement to derive the contrapositive:\n\u00ac(smip must have lupped the zoint) \u2192 \u00ac(smip was shripped)\n\nNow, combining the first and the derived statement:\n\u00ac(smip must have lupped the zoint) and \u00ac(smip was shripped)\n\nThis means that if the smip did not have to lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
