Assume that the flug was blummed (Blummed). Then, from the second statement, we can infer that the flug must have been zimmed (Zimmed). However, this contradicts the first statement \u00ac(Zimmed). Therefore, our assumption that the flug was blummed leads to a contradiction.\n\nSo, we can infer that the flug was not blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
