Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement of the form p \u2192 q and we know that q is false, then we can infer that p is also false.\n\nSo, applying modus tollens to the given information:\n- From plooked \u2192 must have been nugged and \u00ac(must have been nugged), we can infer \u00acplooked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer \"The shank was not plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
