From the second statement, we know that the zinger must either be smoogled or fraggled.\n\nGiven this information, we cannot infer that \"The zinger is fraggled\" because it's possible that the zinger is not smoogled and it's also possible that it is fraggled. Therefore, we cannot make a definite inference about the zinger's state based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
