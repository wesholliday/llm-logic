So, it tells us that the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot directly infer \"The dreb is vroombed\" because the first statement only tells us that it might not be spened, and the second statement does not definitively state the status of the dreb.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The dreb is vroombed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
