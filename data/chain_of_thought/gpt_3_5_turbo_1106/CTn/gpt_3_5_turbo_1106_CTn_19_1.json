The original statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball\" is a conditional statement in the form of \"if P, then Q\". The inverse of a conditional statement \"if P, then Q\" is \"if not Q, then not P\".\n\nNow, let's check if the inverse statement is valid. If Jen watched basketball, we know this doesn't necessarily mean Tom did not watch football, because there's no direct relation between Jen watching basketball and Tom not watching football.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
