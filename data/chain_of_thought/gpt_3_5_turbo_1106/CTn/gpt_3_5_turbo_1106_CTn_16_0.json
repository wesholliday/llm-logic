The original statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim\" can be represented as \"Shirt (cotton) \u2192 Pants (not denim)\".\n\nTo infer the second statement \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton\", we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"Shirt (cotton) \u2192 Pants (not denim)\" is \"Pants (denim) \u2192 Shirt (not cotton)\".\n\nSo, based on the logical relationship between the original statement and its contrapositive, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
