The original statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" can be expressed in the form \"If P, then not Q.\" The inferred statement \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" can be expressed as \"If Q, then not P.\" \n\nIn this case, the inference can be derived using the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then not Q\" is \"If Q, then not P.\" Therefore, the inferred statement is a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nWhen we apply the contrapositive, we see that the logical relationship holds.
