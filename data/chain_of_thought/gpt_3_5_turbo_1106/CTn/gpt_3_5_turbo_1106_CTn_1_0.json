The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\" is \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nSo, yes, we can infer \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\" from the original statement.",
