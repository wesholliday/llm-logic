The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" \n\nSo, the contrapositive of \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin did not take a train\" is \"If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\nNow, let's check if the contrapositive is true based on the original statement.\n\nOriginal statement: If Sam took a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\nContrapositive: If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\n\nBased on the original statement, if Sam took a plane, then Erin did not take a train. This means that if Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
