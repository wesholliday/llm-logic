The original statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis\" can be represented as \"J \u2192 \u00acA\" (where J stands for Jeff playing basketball and A stands for Amy playing tennis).\n\nNow, to infer the statement \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\", we need to use the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"J \u2192 \u00acA\" is \"A \u2192 \u00acJ\". This means that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nSo, based on the contrapositive of the original statement, we can infer \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
