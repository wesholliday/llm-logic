            "content": "To answer this question, it's helpful to understand the concept of the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \"if p then q\" is \"if not q then not p\". \n\nIn this case, if we have the statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was not outside\", we can rephrase it as \"If the dog was not outside, then the cat was inside\". This is the contrapositive of the original statement. \n\nNow, if we want to infer \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside\", we can identify that this is consistent with the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nSo, the answer is: yes",

The original statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was not outside\" can be represented as D --> ~C. Now, we want to know if we can infer \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside,\" which can be represented as C --> ~D.\n\nTo infer the second statement from the first, we can use the contrapositive logic. The contrapositive of D --> ~C is ~(~C) --> ~D, which simplifies to C --> ~D.\n\nSo, based on the contrapositive logic, we can infer \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
