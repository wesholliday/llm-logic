The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order.\n\nSo, the contrapositive of \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den\" is \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
