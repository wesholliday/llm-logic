The original statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow\" can be represented as \"A -> ~B\" where A represents the apple being red and B represents the banana being yellow.\n\nNow, to infer the second statement \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red\" from the original statement, we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"A -> ~B\" is \"~(~B) -> ~A\", which simplifies to \"B -> ~A\".\n\nSo, based on the contrapositive, we can infer the second statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
