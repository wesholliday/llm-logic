The original statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate did not eat the salad\" is a conditional statement in the form \"if p, then q.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If Kate ate the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.
