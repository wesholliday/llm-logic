The original statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was not blue\" can be represented as \"C \u2192 \u00acT\" where C represents the car being red and T represents the truck being blue.\n\nNow, to infer the statement \"If the truck was blue, then the car was not red\" from the original statement, we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"C \u2192 \u00acT\" is \"T \u2192 \u00acC\", which can be read as \"If the truck was blue, then the car was not red.\"\n\nSo, based on the logical relationship between the original statement and its contrapositive, we can infer \"If the truck was blue, then the car was not red\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
