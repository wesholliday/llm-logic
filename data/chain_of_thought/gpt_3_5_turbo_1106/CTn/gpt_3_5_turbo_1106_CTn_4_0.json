The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"if p, then q\" is \"if not q, then not p\". In this case, the contrapositive of the original statement is \"If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars\". Therefore, we can infer the given statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
