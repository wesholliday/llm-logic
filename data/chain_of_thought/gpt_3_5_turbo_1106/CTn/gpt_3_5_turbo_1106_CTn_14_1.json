In formal logic, this can be represented as \"A -> \u00acB\". \n\nTo infer the statement \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave,\" we would need to apply the contrapositive. The contrapositive of \"A -> \u00acB\" is \"B -> \u00acA\". This means if we take the original implication and switch the two parts while negating each, we would get the contrapositive.\n\nGiven this, we can infer the statement \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave\" from the original statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
