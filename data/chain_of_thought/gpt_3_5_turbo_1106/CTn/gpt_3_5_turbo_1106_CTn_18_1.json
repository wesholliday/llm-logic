The converse of \"If A, then B\" is \"If B, then A.\" \n\nSo, in this case, we want to infer \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic.\" \n\nNow, let's analyze the meaning of the original statement. The original statement tells us that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was not metal. This does not necessarily mean that the truck being metal leads to the doll not being plastic. \n\nThink about it in terms of a Venn diagram. If we represent the dolls and trucks with circles, and plastic and metal with different shapes inside these circles, the original statement tells us that the plastic doll circle is outside of the metal truck shape. This does not provide information about the position of the metal truck shape in relation to the plastic doll circle.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic\" based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
