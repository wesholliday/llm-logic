The original statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\" can be represented as \"C \u2192 \u00acM\" (where C represents the cake being chocolate and M represents the muffins being blueberry).\n\nNow, to infer the statement \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate,\" we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"C \u2192 \u00acM\" is \"M \u2192 \u00acC\" (where \u00acC represents the cake not being chocolate and M represents the muffins being blueberry).\n\nSo, based on the original statement and its contrapositive, we can infer the statement \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
