The next statement is \"The banana was yellow\", which is a simple statement.\n3. When the original conditional statement and the second statement are combined, we have: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" together with \"The banana was yellow\".\n4. From the original conditional statement and the given information, we can conclude that the antecedent of the conditional statement is true (\"The banana was yellow\").\n5. If the antecedent is true in a conditional statement, then the consequent must also be true if the statement as a whole is true.\n6. Therefore, given the original conditional statement and the fact that the banana was yellow, we can infer that \"The apple was red\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
