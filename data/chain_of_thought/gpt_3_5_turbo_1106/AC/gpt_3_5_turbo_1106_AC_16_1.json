The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" The second statement tells us that \"The pants were denim.\" Given these two premises, we should apply modus ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement \"If p, then q\" and we know p is true, then we can infer q. In this case, since the pants were denim, according to the first statement, the shirt must have been cotton.\n\nSo, based on these premises and using modus ponens, we can infer that \"The shirt was cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
