The first statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" means that if Sue chose pizza, then it is certain that Bob chose pasta. The second statement \"Bob chose pasta\" gives us the information that Bob indeed chose pasta.\n\nNow, given these two statements, we cannot necessarily infer that Sue chose pizza, because the first statement does not give us any information about what happens when Bob chooses pasta. It only tells us about what happens when Sue chooses pizza.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sue chose pizza from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
