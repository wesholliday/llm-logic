From this, we can conclude that B is true.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer the truth value of A from the given information. The original statement only tells us what would happen if the apple was red, but it does not tell us anything about the actual color of the apple.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The apple was red\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
