However, we cannot directly infer that the bear was in the cave from the given statements alone. This is because the conditional statement does not provide information about the bear's location when the wolf is in the den.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer \"The bear was in the cave.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
