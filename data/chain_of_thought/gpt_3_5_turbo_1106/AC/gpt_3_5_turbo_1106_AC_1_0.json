This is because the first statement tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. Since we know that Sue was at the wedding, it follows that Mary must have been at the wedding as well.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can infer that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
