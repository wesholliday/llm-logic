The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nGiven the original statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" and the fact \"Mark bought the blue shirt,\" we can apply the contrapositive to infer that \"If not blue shirt, then not red shirt.\"\n\nSo, if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt. However, we cannot infer that Lisa bought the red shirt from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
