By combining this with the statement \"The muffins were blueberry\", we can indeed infer that \"The cake was chocolate.\" This is because the conditional relationship tells us that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry, and since we know the muffins are blueberry, it follows that the cake must be chocolate.\n\nIn symbolic form:\n1.
