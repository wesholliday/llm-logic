If we negate the first part of the statement (\"The medicine must have been taken with food\"), we get \"The medicine must not have been taken with food.\" This leaves us with the second possibility: \"The medicine must have been taken on an empty stomach.\" Therefore, we can infer that the medicine must have been taken on an empty stomach.\n\nAnswer: yes",
