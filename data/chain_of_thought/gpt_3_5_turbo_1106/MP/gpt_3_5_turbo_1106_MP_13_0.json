When the condition \"the car was red\" is true, the consequent \"the truck was blue\" is also true. \n\nGiven the second statement \"The car was red\", we can conclude that the condition of the conditional statement is true. Therefore, according to the conditional statement, the consequent \"the truck was blue\" must also be true.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The truck was blue.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
