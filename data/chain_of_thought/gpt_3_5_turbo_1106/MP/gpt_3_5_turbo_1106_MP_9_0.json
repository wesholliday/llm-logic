When the first part of the conditional statement is true, it does not necessarily mean that the second part is true. However, if the first part is false, then the entire statement is true.\n\nGiven that Lisa bought the red shirt, we can conclude that the first part of the conditional statement is true. However, we cannot directly infer that Mark bought the blue shirt without additional information.\n\nAnswer: no",
