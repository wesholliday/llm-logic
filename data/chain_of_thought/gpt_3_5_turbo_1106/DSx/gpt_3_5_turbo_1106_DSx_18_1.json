Let's denote \"the shank is plooked\" as P and \"the shank is nugged\" as N.\n\nThe first statement can be rewritten as \"P or N\" and the second statement is \"not N\".\n\nWith this in mind, we want to see if we can infer \"P\" from the given information.\n\nNow, from \"P or N\" and \"not N\", we can indeed infer \"P\" using the rule of disjunctive syllogism. This rule states that if we have a disjunction (P or Q) and the negation of one of the options (not Q), then we can infer the other option (P in this case).\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"P\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",

The given premises are:\n   a) Either the shank is plooked or it is nugged.\n   b) The shank is not nugged.\n\n2. From the first premise, we can write it as \"p \u2228 n\" where p represents \"the shank is plooked\" and n represents \"the shank is nugged.\"\n\n3. The second premise tells us that \"The shank is not nugged,\" which can be represented as \u00acn.\n\n4. Using these premises, we can apply the rule of disjunctive syllogism, which states that from the disjunction \"p \u2228 q\" and the denial of one of the disjuncts, we can infer the other disjunct. In this case, we have \"p \u2228 n\" and \u00acn, so we can infer p.\n\nNow, considering the steps above, can we infer \"The shank is plooked\" from the given premises?\n",
