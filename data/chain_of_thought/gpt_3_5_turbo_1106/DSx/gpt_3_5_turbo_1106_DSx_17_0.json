Either the flob is skizzled or it is movated\n2. The flob is not movated\n\nWe can use the first statement to form the conditional \"if the flob is skizzled then it is not movated\". Then, using modus tollens, we can infer that if the flob is not movated, then it is not skizzled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The flob is not skizzled\" from the given statements.",
