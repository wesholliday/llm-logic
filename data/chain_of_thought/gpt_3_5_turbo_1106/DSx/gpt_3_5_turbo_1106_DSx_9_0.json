This is a logical statement that can be represented as \"P or Q\" where P is \"the twonk is plinked\" and Q is \"the twonk is varnished.\"\n\nNow, we are given the additional statement \"The twonk is not plinked,\" which can be represented as \"not P.\"\n\nFrom these two statements, we can use the logical rule of disjunctive syllogism, which states that if we have a disjunction (P or Q) and the negation of one of the disjuncts (not P), then we can infer the other disjunct (Q).\n\nSo, applying the disjunctive syllogism to the given statements, we can infer \"The twonk is varnished.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
