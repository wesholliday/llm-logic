The original statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat did not quank\" can be represented as \"Morphed \u2192 Not quank\" (M \u2192 \u00acQ). \n\nTo infer the second statement \"If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed,\" we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"Morphed \u2192 Not quank\" is \"Quank \u2192 Not morphed\" (Q \u2192 \u00acM).\n\nSo, based on the original statement and its contrapositive, we can infer the second statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
