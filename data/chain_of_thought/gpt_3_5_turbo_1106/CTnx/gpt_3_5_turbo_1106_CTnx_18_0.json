The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If p, then q\" is \"If not q, then not p.\"\n\nSo, the contrapositive of the given statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was not nugged\" is \"If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer the statement \"If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
