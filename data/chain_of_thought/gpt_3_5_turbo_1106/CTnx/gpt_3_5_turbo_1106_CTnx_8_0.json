The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion and then reversing their order.\n\nThe given statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled\" can be represented as \"If p, then not q.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of this statement is \"If q, then not p.\"\n\nSo, the contrapositive of the given statement is \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer the statement \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
