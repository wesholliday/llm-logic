The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If p, then q\" is \"If not q, then not p.\"\n\nIn this case, the given statement \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug did not snugged\" can be rewritten as \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug did not snugged\" and its contrapositive is \"If the clug snugged, then the clug was not fleeked.\"\n\nSo, based on the contrapositive rule, we can infer the statement \"If the clug snugged, then the clug was not fleeked\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
