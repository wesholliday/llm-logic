The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If p, then q\" is \"If not q, then not p.\" In this case, the contrapositive of the given statement is \"If it was garpled, then it was sproinged.\" \n\nSo, the contrapositive of the given statement does not match the statement \"If the wug was garpled, then the wug was not sproinged.\" Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the wug was garpled, then the wug was not sproinged\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
