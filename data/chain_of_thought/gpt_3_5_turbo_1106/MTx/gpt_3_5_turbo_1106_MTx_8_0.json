The contrapositive of \"Cranked -> Daggled\" is \"Not Daggled -> Not Cranked\", which means if the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nSo, based on the contrapositive of the first statement and the second statement, we can infer \"The sprocket was not cranked\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
