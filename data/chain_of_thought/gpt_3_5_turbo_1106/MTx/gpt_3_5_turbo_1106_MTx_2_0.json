The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nSo, if we apply the contrapositive to the original statement, we get: \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\"\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer \"The wug was not flooped.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
