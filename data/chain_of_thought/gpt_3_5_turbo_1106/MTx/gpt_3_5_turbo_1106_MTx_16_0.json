The fact \"The sneg did not sproted the frink\" can be represented as \"\u00acQ\" where \u00acQ is \"not Q\" or \"the sneg did not sproted the frink.\"\n\nNow, let's use the contrapositive of the original statement to see if we can infer \"The sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of \"P \u2192 Q\" is \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP,\" which means \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nSo, if \"\u00acQ\" is true (the sneg did not sproted the frink), then we can infer \"\u00acP\" (the sneg was not crampled).\n\nAnswer: yes",
