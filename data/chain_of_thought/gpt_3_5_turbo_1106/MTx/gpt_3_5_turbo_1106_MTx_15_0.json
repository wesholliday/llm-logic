If p, then q (If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened)\n2. Not q (The dreb was not spened)\n\nNow, we want to infer \"Not p\" (The dreb was not vroombed) from these statements. To do this, we can use the contrapositive of the first statement, which states that if not q, then not p. \n\nSo, if we take the contrapositive of the first statement, it becomes: If not q, then not p (If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed).\n\nGiven that \"The dreb was not spened\" (not q), we can infer \"The dreb was not vroombed\" (not p) based on the contrapositive of the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
