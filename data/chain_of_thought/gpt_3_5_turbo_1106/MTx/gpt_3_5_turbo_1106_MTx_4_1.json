This means that if we know \"\u00acq\", then we can conclude \"\u00acp\".\n\nSo, in this case, if we know \"\u00acq\" (the fribble did not crink), then we can infer \"\u00acp\" (the fribble was not snurgled).\n\nTo summarize:\nOriginal statement: p \u2192 q\nGiven: \u00acq\nUsing contrapositive: \u00acp\n\nAnswer: yes",
