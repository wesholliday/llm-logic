However, the second statement tells us that the smonk did not plagged.\n\nNow, let's consider the inference \"The smonk was not vreebled.\" If the smonk was vreebled, then it would have plagged according to the first statement. But the second statement tells us that the smonk did not plagged. Therefore, we can infer that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
