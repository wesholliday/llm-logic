We can use the contrapositive of the original statement to make inferences:\n- The contrapositive of A \u2192 B is \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA (if not B, then not A).\n\nSo, using the contrapositive, we have \"if not B (\u00acB), then not A (\u00acA)\".\n\nNext, \"The smonk did not plagged\" can be used to substitute for \"not B (\u00acB)\" in our contrapositive statement.\n\nUsing the contrapositive and the given information, we can infer that \"The smonk was not vreebled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
