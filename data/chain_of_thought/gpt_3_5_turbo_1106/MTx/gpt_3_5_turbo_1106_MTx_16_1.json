            "content": "First, let's identify the logical relationship between the statements. The original statement is an implication \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"the sneg was crampled\" and Q is \"the sneg sproted the frink.\" The second statement is the negation of Q, \"not Q.\" \n\nFrom the original implication \"If P, then Q,\" we know that if the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must be true. Conversely, if the consequent (Q) is false, then we know the antecedent (P) must also be false. This is based on the logic of the implication, where the only way for an implication to be false is if the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. \n\nSo, in this case, if \"the sneg sproted the frink\" (Q) is false, then \"the sneg was crampled\" (P) must also be false. \n\nBy applying the logical relationship between the statements, we can infer that \"The sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
