The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nSo, the contrapositive of \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" is \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\"\n\nGiven that \"The grommet did not plop the frink,\" we can infer from the contrapositive that \"The grommet was not sploffed.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer \"The grommet was not sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
