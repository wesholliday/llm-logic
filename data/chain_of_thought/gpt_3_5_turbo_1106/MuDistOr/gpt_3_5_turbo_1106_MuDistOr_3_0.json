In this case, it means that the book must have been on the shelf, or it must have been in the backpack, or it could have been in both places. Therefore, we can infer that the book must have been on the shelf or it must have been in the backpack, as these are the two possibilities indicated by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
