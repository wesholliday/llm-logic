When we rephrase it as \"The experiment must have been conducted in a lab or it must have been conducted in the field,\" we are creating a conjunction, which implies that the experiment was conducted in either a lab or in the field, but not both. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: no",
