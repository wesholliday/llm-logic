The contrapositive of a statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the original statement \"The flob might not have been skizzled\" can be interpreted as \"It's possible that the flob was not skizzled.\" Therefore, the contrapositive would be \"It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled.\" \n\nAnswer: yes",
