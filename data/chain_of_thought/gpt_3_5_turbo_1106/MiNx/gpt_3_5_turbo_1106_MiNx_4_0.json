The contrapositive of a statement \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P.\" In this case, the original statement \"The fribble might not have been snurgled\" can be translated as \"It's possible that the fribble was not snurgled.\" So, the contrapositive would be \"If the fribble must have been snurgled, then it's not the case that the fribble might not have been snurgled.\" Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled\" from \"The fribble might not have been snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
