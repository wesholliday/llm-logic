The original statement \"The dreb might not have been vroombed\" can be rewritten as \"It's possible that the dreb was not vroombed.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If it's not the case that the dreb must have been vroombed, then the dreb might not have been vroombed.\" Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been vroombed\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
