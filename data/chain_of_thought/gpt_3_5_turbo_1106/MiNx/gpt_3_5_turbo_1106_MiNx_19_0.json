The original statement only tells us about the possibility of the smonk not being vreebled, but it does not provide enough information to conclude that it must not have been vreebled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
