The original statement \"The smip might not have been shripped\" can be rewritten as \"It's possible that the smip was not shripped.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If it's not the case that the smip was not shripped, then it's not possible that the smip was shripped.\" Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the smip must have been shripped\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
