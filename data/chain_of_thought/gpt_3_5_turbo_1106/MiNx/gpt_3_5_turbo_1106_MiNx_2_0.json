The original statement \"The wug might not have been flooped\" can be rewritten as \"It's possible that the wug was not flooped.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If it's not the case that the wug must have been flooped, then the wug might not have been flooped.\" Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
