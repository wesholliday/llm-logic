The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" \n\nSo, the contrapositive of \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" is \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\"\n\nNow, let's compare the contrapositive with the second statement: \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\"\n\nBy comparing the contrapositive with the second statement, we can see that they are the same. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
