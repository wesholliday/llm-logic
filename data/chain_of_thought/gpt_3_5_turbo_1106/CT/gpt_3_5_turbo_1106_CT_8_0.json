The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". \n\nSo, the contrapositive of \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake\". \n\nNow, let's compare this with the statement we want to infer. If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake. This matches the contrapositive form, so we can infer it from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
