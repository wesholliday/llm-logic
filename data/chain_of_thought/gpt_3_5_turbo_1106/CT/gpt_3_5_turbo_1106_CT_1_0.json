The first statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" can be represented as \"Mary -> Sue\" (where \"->\" represents \"implies\"). \n\nNow, to infer the second statement \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\" from the first, we need to consider the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive of \"Mary -> Sue\" is \"not Sue -> not Mary\" (where \"not\" represents negation).\n\nSo, based on the logical relationship between the two statements and the contrapositive, can we infer the second statement from the first?\n\nAnswer: \nYes",
