The original statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" can be represented as \"A implies B\" where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\nNow, to infer the second statement \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\" from the original statement, we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"A implies B\" is \"Not B implies not A.\"\n\nSo, if we take the contrapositive of the original statement, it becomes \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\" \n\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
