The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\"\n2. The second statement is the contrapositive of the first statement: \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is always true if the original statement is true. This is a fundamental property of conditional statements.\n\nSo, based on the properties of conditional statements, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
