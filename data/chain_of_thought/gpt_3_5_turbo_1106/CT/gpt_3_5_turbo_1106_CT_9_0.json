The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n2. The second statement is the contrapositive of the first statement: \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is always true if the original statement is true. This is a fundamental property of conditional statements.\n\nSo, based on the properties of conditional statements, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
