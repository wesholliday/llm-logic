            "content": "To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, let's consider the logical relationship between the two statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" where P is the antecedent (Tom watched football) and Q is the consequent (Jen watched basketball). The second statement is the contrapositive of the first statement, which is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nTo determine if the second statement can be inferred from the first, we can use the logical equivalence of a conditional statement and its contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original conditional statement.\n\nSo, if the first statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
