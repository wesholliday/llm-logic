The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTo find the contrapositive, we first negate both the hypothesis and the conclusion of the original statement. The negation of \"Sam took a plane\" is \"Sam did not take a plane,\" and the negation of \"Erin took a train\" is \"Erin did not take a train.\" Then we switch the order and add \"if\" and \"then\" to form the contrapositive statement.\n\nSo, the contrapositive of the original statement is: \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'yes'.",
