The first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B.\" The second statement is the contrapositive of the first statement, which is \"If not B, then not A.\" \n\nIn this case, the first statement is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\nSo, based on the logical relationship between the two statements, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
