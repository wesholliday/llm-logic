The original statement is \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n2. The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the logical relationship between the original statement and its contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nSo, based on the logical relationship between a statement and its contrapositive, we can infer \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
