It says that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\nIf Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. But we know that Erin might not have taken a train. This means that Sam cannot have taken a plane, because if he did, Erin would have had to take a train, which contradicts the possibility that Erin might not have taken a train.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
