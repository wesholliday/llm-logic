First, let's consider the statement \"Jen might not have watched basketball.\" This implies that there is a possibility that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\n2. Next, if we combine this with the conditional statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball,\" we can deduce that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. \n\n3. Now, if we consider the original statement and the combined conditional statement, it is possible to infer that if Jen might not have watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\n\nAfter considering the logic of the statements, I can provide an answer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
