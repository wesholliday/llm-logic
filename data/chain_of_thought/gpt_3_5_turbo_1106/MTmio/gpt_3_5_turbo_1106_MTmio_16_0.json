If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these statements. If the pants might not have been denim, then it's possible that they were denim or not denim. However, the second statement creates a condition where if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. \n\nGiven this information, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton. If the shirt were cotton, then the pants would have to be denim according to the second statement. However, the first statement suggests that the pants might not have been denim, so the only way to satisfy both statements is if the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
