It states that if the alien visited Mars, then it is necessary for the robot to have visited Jupiter.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n- If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars, because if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter. \n\nSo, can we infer \"The alien did not visit Mars\" from the given information?\n\nAnswer: yes",
