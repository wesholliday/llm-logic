However, we also know from the first statement that it's possible the wolf was not in the den. \n\nSo, based on the given information, if the wolf might not have been in the den, and the conditional statement implies the wolf must have been in the den if the bear was in the cave, then we can infer that the bear was not in the cave. This is because if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den, but we know the wolf might not have been in the den, leading to the conclusion that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes",
