It states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n- If the muffins might not have been blueberry, then it's possible that they were blueberry.\n- If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\nGiven these statements, we cannot definitively infer that \"The cake was not chocolate.\" The information provided does not allow us to make a conclusive inference about the flavor of the cake.\n\nAnswer: no",
