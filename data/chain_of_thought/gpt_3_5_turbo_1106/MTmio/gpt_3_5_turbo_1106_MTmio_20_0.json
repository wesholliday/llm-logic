It tells us that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If the banana might not have been yellow, then the condition \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" is not satisfied. This means that the antecedent of the conditional statement is not true.\n\n- In logic, if the antecedent of a conditional statement is not true, then the truth value of the entire conditional statement is not relevant.\n\n- Therefore, we cannot infer the color of the apple from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
