It states that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n- If the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n- The book might not be a mystery novel.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the book was not written by James. This is because if the book was written by James, it would have to be a mystery novel according to the second statement. However, the first statement suggests that it might not be a mystery novel, which contradicts the condition set by the second statement.\n\nSo, can we infer \"The book was not written by James\"?\n",
