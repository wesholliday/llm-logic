It states that if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of these statements. If the truck might not have been blue, and if the car being red implies that the truck must have been blue, then it follows that the car cannot be red. This is because if the car were red, it would contradict the possibility that the truck was not blue.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The car was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
