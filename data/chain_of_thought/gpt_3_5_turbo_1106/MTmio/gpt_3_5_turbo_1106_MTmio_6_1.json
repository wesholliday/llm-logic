The negation is \"Sue did not choose pizza OR Bob did not choose pasta\". \n\nSo, if Sue did choose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta, but if Sue did not choose pizza (Sue did not choose pizza), then Bob's choice is not determined to be pasta.\n\nNow, combining the two statements, if Bob might not have chosen pasta and if Sue did not choose pizza, we can infer that Bob might not have chosen pasta and Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
