It means that if Tom watched football, then it is necessary for Jen to have watched basketball.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\nIf Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. However, we know that Jen might not have watched basketball. This means that Tom cannot have watched football, because if he did, Jen would have had to watch basketball according to the second statement. Therefore, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
