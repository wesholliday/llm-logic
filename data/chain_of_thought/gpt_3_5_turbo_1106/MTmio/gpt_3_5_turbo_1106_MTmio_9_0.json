It states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n- If Lisa did buy the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt according to the second statement.\n- However, the first statement tells us that there is a possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nGiven this information, we cannot definitively infer whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
