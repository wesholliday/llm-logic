It means if Sue chose pizza, then Bob's choice must have been pasta.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\nIf Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. But we also know that Bob might not have chosen pasta. This means that Sue cannot choose pizza, because if she did, Bob's choice would have to be pasta, which contradicts the possibility that Bob might not have chosen pasta.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
