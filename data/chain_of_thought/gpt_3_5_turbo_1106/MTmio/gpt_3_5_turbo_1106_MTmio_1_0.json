If Sue might not have been at the wedding and if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This would mean that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there, which contradicts the possibility that Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
