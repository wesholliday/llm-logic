            "content": "Explanation: In logic, the statement \"A or B\" is equivalent to \"A or B or both.\" So, from the original statement \"The blimp must gribble a flonk or gribble a wibble snorkel,\" we can infer that the blimp must either gribble a flonk, or gribble a wibble snorkel, or possibly both. Therefore, we can infer the statement \"The blimp must gribble a flonk or it must gribble a wibble snorkel.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
