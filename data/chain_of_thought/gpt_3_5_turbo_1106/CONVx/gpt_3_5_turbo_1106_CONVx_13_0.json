The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If p, then q\" is \"If not q, then not p.\" In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\" is \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged.\" \n\nSo, the contrapositive of the original statement does not lead to the inference \"If the glip was tragged, then the glip was slogged.\" Therefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If the glip was tragged, then the glip was slogged\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
