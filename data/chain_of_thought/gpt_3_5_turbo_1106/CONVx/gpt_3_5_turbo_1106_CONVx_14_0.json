The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If p, then q\" is \"If not q, then not p.\" In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\" is \"If the clug did not snug, then the clug was not fleeked.\" \n\nSo, if the clug snugged, we cannot directly infer that the clug was fleeked. However, if the clug did not snug, then we can infer that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: no",
