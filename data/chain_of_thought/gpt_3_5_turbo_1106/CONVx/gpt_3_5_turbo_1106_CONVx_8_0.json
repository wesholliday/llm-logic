A bidirectional implication means that both parts of the statement can be reversed without changing the meaning. \n\nIn this case, the original statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" does not necessarily imply that \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was cranked.\" It only states the relationship in one direction. Therefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was cranked\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
