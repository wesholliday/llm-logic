The contrapositive of a statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" is \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed.\" \n\nNow, let's compare the original statement and its contrapositive to see if they are equivalent. If they are, then we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nOriginal statement: If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\nContrapositive: If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed.\n\nBy comparing the original statement and its contrapositive, we can see that they are not equivalent. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no",
