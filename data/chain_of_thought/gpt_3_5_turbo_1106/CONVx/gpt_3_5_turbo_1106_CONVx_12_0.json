The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If p, then q\" is \"If not q, then not p.\" In this case, the contrapositive of the original statement is \"If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped.\" \n\nSo, the contrapositive of the original statement does not match the inferred statement. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was shripped\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
