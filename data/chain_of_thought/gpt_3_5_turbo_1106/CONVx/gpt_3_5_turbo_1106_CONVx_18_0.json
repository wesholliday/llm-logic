The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" \n\nSo, the contrapositive of \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\" is \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\" \n\nNow, let's compare the original statement and its contrapositive to see if we can infer the given statement.\n\nOriginal statement: If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\nContrapositive: If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked\n\nBy comparing the original statement and its contrapositive, we can see that they are not equivalent. Therefore, we cannot infer the statement \"If the shank was nugged, then the shank was plooked\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
