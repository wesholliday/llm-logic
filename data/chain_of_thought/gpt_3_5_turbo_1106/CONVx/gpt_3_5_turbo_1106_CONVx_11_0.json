The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\" is \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\" \n\nNow, let's compare the original statement with its contrapositive. If the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, then we can infer the statement \"If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was blummed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
