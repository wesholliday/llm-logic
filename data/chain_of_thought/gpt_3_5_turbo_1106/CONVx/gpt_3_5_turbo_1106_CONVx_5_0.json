The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If p, then q\" is \"If not q, then not p.\" In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\" is \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled.\" \n\nSo, to infer the statement \"If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was fraggled,\" we need to negate both the antecedent and the consequent of the original statement. Since the contrapositive statement is not the same as the original statement, we cannot infer \"If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was fraggled\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
