The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If p, then q\" is \"If not q, then not p.\" In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint\" is \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\" \n\nSo, if we can infer \"If the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was flooped,\" it means that the original statement and its contrapositive are equivalent, and therefore, we can infer \"If the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was flooped.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
