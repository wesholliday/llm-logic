To determine if the reverse implication holds true, we can use the law of contrapositive. The contrapositive of \"P -> Q\" is \"not Q -> not P\". Therefore, if we can determine that \"If the flob was movated, then the flob was not skizzled\" is true, then the reverse implication holds.\n\nNow, let's consider whether \"If the flob was movated, then the flob was not skizzled\" is a logical inference from the original statement.\n\nStarting with \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\" (P -> Q), the contrapositive would be \"If the flob was not movated, then the flob was not skizzled\" (not Q -> not P).\n\nHowever, the contrapositive does not necessarily hold in the reverse direction.
