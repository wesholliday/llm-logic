The contrapositive of a statement \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" is \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\" \n\nSo, if we can infer \"If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was sploffed\" from the original statement, it means the original statement and its contrapositive are equivalent.\n\nAnswer: no",
