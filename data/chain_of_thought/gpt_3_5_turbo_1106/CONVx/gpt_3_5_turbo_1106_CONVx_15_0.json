The contrapositive of the statement \"If A then B\" is \"If not B then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\" is \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\" \n\nNow, let's compare the original statement with its contrapositive to see if they are equivalent. If they are, then we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nOriginal statement: If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\nContrapositive: If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\n\nBy comparing the original statement with its contrapositive, we can determine if we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no",
