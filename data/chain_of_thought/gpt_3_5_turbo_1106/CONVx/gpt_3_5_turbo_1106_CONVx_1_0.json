The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If p, then q\" is \"If not q, then not p.\" In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled\" is \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\" \n\nSo, to infer the statement \"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was blimmed,\" we need to reverse the order of the conditions and negate both. Therefore, the inference is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
