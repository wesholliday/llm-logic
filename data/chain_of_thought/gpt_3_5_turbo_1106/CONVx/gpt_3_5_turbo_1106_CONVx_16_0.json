The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If p, then q\" is \"If not q, then not p.\" In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\" is \"If the sneg did not sprot the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\" \n\nSo, the contrapositive of the given statement does not match the inferred statement. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was crampled\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
