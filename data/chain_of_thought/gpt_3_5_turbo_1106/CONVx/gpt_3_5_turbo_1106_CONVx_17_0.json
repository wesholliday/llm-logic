The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" \n\nSo, the contrapositive of \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\" is \"If the flob did not movate, then the flob was not skizzled.\" \n\nNow, let's compare the original statement and its contrapositive to see if they are equivalent. If they are, then we can infer \"If the flob movated, then the flob was skizzled.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
