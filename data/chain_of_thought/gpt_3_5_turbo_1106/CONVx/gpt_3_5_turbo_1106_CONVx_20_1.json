It assumes that if the fleeg surned, then it must have been bluttered.\n\nNow, using logical reasoning, we can determine whether the inference is valid based on the original statement. This type of inference is called the converse of a conditional statement. \n\nIn logic, the converse of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If B, then A.\" To help determine the validity of the inference, let's consider whether the converse is always true.\n\nIn this case, inferring \"If the fleeg surned, then it was bluttered\" from the original statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" is not necessarily valid. It's possible that only bluttered fleegs surn, but surning might not necessarily mean that a fleeg was bluttered.
