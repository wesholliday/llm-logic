(The glip is slogged) \u2228 \u00ac(The glip must be tragged)\n\nNow, we can use the second statement to infer that if the glip must not be tragged, then it must be slogged. This is because the second statement says that either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged, so if it must not be tragged, then it must be slogged.\n\nSo, from the given statements, we can infer that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
