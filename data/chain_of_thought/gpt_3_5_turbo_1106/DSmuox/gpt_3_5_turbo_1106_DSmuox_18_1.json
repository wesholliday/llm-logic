The statement \"It's not the case that the shank must be nugged\" can be rewritten as \"It's false that the shank must be nugged\" or \"The shank is not necessary to be nugged\". This can be denoted as \u00acN.\n\n2. The statement \"Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged\" can be represented as P \u2228 N, where P represents \"The shank is plooked\" and N represents \"The shank must be nugged\".\n\n3. So, if we combine the two original statements, we have \u00acN and P \u2228 N.\n\n4. By applying the law of excluded middle, either P is true or N is true. We already established that \u00acN is true, so it follows that P must be true.\n\nHence, we can infer \"The shank is plooked\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
