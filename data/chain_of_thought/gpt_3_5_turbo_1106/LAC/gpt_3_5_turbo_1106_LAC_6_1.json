The structure of this statement is \"if P, then Q\", where P is \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q is \"Bob chose pasta\". Given this conditional statement and the fact that \"Bob chose pasta\", we can conclude that if the conditional statement is true, Sue must have chosen pizza. This is because the only way for the conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" to be true while \"Bob chose pasta\" is also true is if Sue indeed chose pizza. \n\nThus, based on the given information, we can logically infer \"Sue chose pizza\".\n",
