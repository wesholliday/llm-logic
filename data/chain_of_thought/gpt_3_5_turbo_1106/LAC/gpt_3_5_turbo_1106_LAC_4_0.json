Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"if P then Q\" and we also have the statement \"P\", then we can infer \"Q\".\n\nGiven:\n1. If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter (A -> J)\n2. The robot visited Jupiter (J)\n\nUsing modus ponens:\n3. The alien visited Mars (A)\n\nSo, based on the given statements and using modus ponens, we can logically infer \"The alien visited Mars\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
