It means that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. However, it does not tell us anything about the shirt if the pants are denim.\n\n2. \"The pants were denim\" - This statement tells us the material of the pants.\n\nGiven these statements, we cannot logically infer that \"The shirt was cotton\" because the first statement only tells us about the relationship between the shirt and the pants, not the other way around.\n\nAnswer: no",
