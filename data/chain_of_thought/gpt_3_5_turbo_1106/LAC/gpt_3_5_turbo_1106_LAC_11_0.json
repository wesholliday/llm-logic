Then, we have the statement \"The muffins were blueberry\" as \"Muffins\". \n\nGiven these two statements, we can use modus ponens, a valid form of logical reasoning, to infer the conclusion. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"A \u2192 B\" and we also have \"A\", then we can logically infer \"B\".\n\nSo, in this case, we have \"Cake \u2192 Muffins\" and \"Muffins\", which allows us to logically infer \"Cake\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
