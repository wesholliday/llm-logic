This is because if the first statement is true (if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding), and the second statement is true (Sue was at the wedding), then it logically follows that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nSo, based on the given information, we can logically infer that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
