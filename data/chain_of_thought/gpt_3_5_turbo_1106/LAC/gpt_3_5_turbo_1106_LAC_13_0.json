The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\n2. The second statement is a simple statement: \"The truck was blue.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use the first statement to make an inference. If the car was red, then the truck was blue. Since the truck was blue, we can infer that the car was red.\n\nSo, based on the given statements, we can logically infer \"The car was red.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
