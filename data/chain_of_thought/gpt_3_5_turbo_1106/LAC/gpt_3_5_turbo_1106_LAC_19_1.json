When combined with the fact \"Jen watched basketball,\" one might be tempted to conclude that \"Tom watched football.\" However, we must remember that just because the antecedent of a conditional statement is true (Tom watched football), it doesn't necessarily mean that the consequent (Jen watched basketball) is also true. In this case, we only know that Jen watched basketball, but we do not have any information about whether Tom watched football or not. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that Tom watched football based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",

Given the second statement \"Jen watched basketball\" (J), we want to know if we can logically infer the first statement \"Tom watched football\" (T).\n\nTo do this, we can use the contrapositive of the original implication.
