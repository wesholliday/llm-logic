Either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet.\n2. The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet.\n\nUsing disjunctive syllogism, we can infer:\n3. The keys are in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and the rule of inference, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
