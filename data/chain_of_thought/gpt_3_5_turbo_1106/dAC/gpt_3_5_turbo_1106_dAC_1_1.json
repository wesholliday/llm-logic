This is because if the statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is true and we also know that \"Sue was at the wedding\", then we can infer that Mary must also have been at the wedding. This is based on the logical implication where if the antecedent (Mary at the wedding) is true, then the consequent (Sue at the wedding) must also be true. Therefore, since we know Sue was at the wedding, it follows that Mary was also at the wedding.",
