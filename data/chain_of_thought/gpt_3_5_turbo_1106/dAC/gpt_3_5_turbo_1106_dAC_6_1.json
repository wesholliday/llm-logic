If the statement is true, and if we also have the information \"Bob chose pasta\", then we can deduce that \"Sue chose pizza\". Let's analyze:\n\n1. \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" - This is a conditional statement, and in logic, it is only false if the antecedent (Sue chose pizza) is true and the consequent (Bob chose pasta) is false. Otherwise, it is true.\n\n2. \"Bob chose pasta\" - This statement provides us with the information that the consequent in the conditional statement is true.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, if the conditional statement is true, and we know the consequent is true, then we can deduce that the antecedent is also true.\n\nTherefore, can we deduce 'Sue chose pizza'?\n\nAnswer: yes",
