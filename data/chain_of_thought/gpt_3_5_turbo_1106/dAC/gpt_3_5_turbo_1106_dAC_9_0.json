            "content": "First, let's analyze the original statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This is a conditional statement, and the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nGiven the original statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" and the fact \"Mark bought the blue shirt,\" we can apply the contrapositive to deduce that \"If not Mark bought the blue shirt, then not Lisa bought the red shirt.\"\n\nSo, if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt. However, we cannot deduce from this that Lisa bought the red shirt, as we only know that Mark bought the blue shirt, not that he did not buy it.\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
