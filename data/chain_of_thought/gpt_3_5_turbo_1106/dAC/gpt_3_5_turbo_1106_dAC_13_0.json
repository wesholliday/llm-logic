However, it does not tell us anything about the color of the car if the truck is blue.\n\nNow, if we know that \"The truck was blue,\" this only confirms the second part of the conditional statement, but it does not provide any information about the color of the car.\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce \"The car was red\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
