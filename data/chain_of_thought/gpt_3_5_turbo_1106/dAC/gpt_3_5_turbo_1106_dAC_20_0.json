This statement can be represented as \"A -> B\" where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow\". \n\nNow, we are given the additional statement \"The banana was yellow\", which we can represent as \"B\".\n\nFrom these two statements, we want to deduce whether we can conclude \"The apple was red\", which is represented as \"A\".\n\nTo do this, we can use the concept of modus ponens, a valid form of argument. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"A -> B\" and we also have \"A\", then we can conclude \"B\".\n\nSo, in this case, if we have \"A -> B\" and \"B\", we can deduce \"A\".\n\nNow, let's apply modus ponens to the given statements and see if we can deduce \"The apple was red\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
