The book is a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationship between the statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the book was written by James) is true, then the consequent (the book is a mystery novel) must also be true. However, the truth value of the antecedent being false does not necessarily mean that the consequent is false.\n\nGiven that the book is a mystery novel, we cannot deduce from this information alone whether the book was written by James. It is possible that the book was written by someone else and still be a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce \"The book was written by James\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
