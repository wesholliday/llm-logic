We can use the contrapositive of the conditional statement to make a deduction.\n\nThe contrapositive of \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\"\n\nGiven \"The truck was metal,\" we can conclude that \"The doll was plastic\" based on the contrapositive of the conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
