The premise \"If we go to the concert, then we'll have a good time\" can be represented as P -> Q, where P is \"we go to the concert\" and Q is \"we'll have a good time\". The conclusion \"If we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time\" can be represented as (P and R) -> Q, where R is \"a bomb goes off\".\n\nNow, to check the logical validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise because the introduction of the bomb going off (R) is not supported by the premise. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
