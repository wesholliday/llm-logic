The premise \"If the bill is paid, then the services will continue\" can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the bill is paid\" and Q is \"the services will continue\". \n\nThe conclusion \"If the bill is paid and the check bounces, then the services will continue\" can be represented as (P \u2227 R) \u2192 Q, where R is \"the check bounces\".\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise because the premise only talks about the bill being paid, not about the check bouncing. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
