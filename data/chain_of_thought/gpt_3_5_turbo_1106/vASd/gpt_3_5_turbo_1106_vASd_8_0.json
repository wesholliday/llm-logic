The premise \"If the package has shipped, then it will arrive today\" can be represented as P \u2192 Q, and the conclusion \"If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today\" can be represented as (P \u2227 R) \u2192 Q. \n\nNow, if we assume that the package has shipped (P) and it was misrouted (R), we can use the premise to conclude that it will arrive today (Q). This aligns with the form of hypothetical syllogism, which states that if P \u2192 Q and (P \u2227 R) \u2192 Q, then (P \u2227 R) \u2192 Q is a valid conclusion.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
