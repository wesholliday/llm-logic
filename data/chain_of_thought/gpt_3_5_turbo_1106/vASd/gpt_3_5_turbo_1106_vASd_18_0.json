            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we can use the principle of logical implication. The premise \"If I water the plants, they will grow\" can be represented as P -> Q, where P is \"I water the plants\" and Q is \"the plants will grow\". The conclusion \"If I water the plants and there is no sunlight, they will grow\" can be represented as (P and R) -> Q, where R is \"there is no sunlight\".\n\nNow, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, the conclusion \"If I water the plants and there is no sunlight, they will grow\" can be seen as a combination of the original premise and an additional condition (no sunlight). So, if we water the plants and there is no sunlight, it should still lead to the plants growing based on the original premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
