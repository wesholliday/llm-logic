The premise \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired\" can be represented as P -> Q, where P is \"you get enough sleep\" and Q is \"you won't be tired\". \n\nThe conclusion \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired\" can be represented as (P and R) -> Q, where R is \"you do hard labor\".\n\nNow, if we assume the premise \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired\" (P -> Q) and combine it with the additional condition \"you do hard labor\" (R), we can conclude that \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired\" ((P and R) -> Q).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
