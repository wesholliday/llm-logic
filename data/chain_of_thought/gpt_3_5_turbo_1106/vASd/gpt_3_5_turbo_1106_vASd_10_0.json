The premise \"If the order is placed, then the item will ship\" can be represented as P \u2192 Q, and the conclusion \"If the order is placed and the item is out of stock, then it will ship\" can be represented as (P \u2227 R) \u2192 Q. \n\nNow, if we assume that the order is placed (P) and the item is out of stock (R), we can use the premise to conclude that the item will ship (Q). This aligns with the conclusion of the argument. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
