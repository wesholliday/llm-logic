The premise \"If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A\" can be represented as P \u2192 Q, and the conclusion \"If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A\" can be represented as (P \u2227 R) \u2192 Q. \n\nNow, if we assume that the essay is well-written (P) and turned in late (R), we can use the premise to conclude that the student will get an A (Q). Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
