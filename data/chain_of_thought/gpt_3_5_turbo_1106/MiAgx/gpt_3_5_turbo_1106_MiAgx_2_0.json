            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The frazzle might be on the zump and the gribble might wozzle a frazzle grooble\" uses the word \"might\" to indicate possibility. This means that it is not a definite statement but rather a potential scenario. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement \"It might be that the frazzle is on the zump and the gribble wozzles a frazzle grooble\" from the original statement, as it is also a potential scenario and not a definite statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
