            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The zizz might be snizzle on quank and the wibble might wump fizzle quimble\" uses the word \"might\" to express possibility. When we rephrase it as \"It might be that the zizz is snizzle on quank and the wibble wumps fizzle quimble,\" we are essentially restating the original statement with a slightly different structure. The use of \"might\" in both statements indicates that they are both expressing possibility, so we can infer the second statement from the first.\nAnswer: yes",
