From the second statement, we know that it's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that the umbrella is in the car because if it's not in the closet, and it's not required to be in the closet, then it must be in the car.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
