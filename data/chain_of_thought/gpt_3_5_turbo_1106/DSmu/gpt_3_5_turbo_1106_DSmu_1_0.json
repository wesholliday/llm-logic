Fido_inside OR Fido_garden\n2. NOT Fido_garden\n\nFrom the second statement, we can infer NOT Fido_garden, which means Fido is not in the garden. Since Fido must be in one of the two places (inside or in the garden), and we know he is not in the garden, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nSo, yes, we can infer \"Fido is inside\" from the given statements.",
