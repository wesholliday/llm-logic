When we rephrase it as \"The flight might be delayed or it might be on time,\" we are essentially restating the original statement in a slightly different way. Both statements convey the same meaning, so we can infer \"The flight might be delayed or it might be on time\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
