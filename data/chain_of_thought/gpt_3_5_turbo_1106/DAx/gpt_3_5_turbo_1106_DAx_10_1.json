This can be represented as \"S -> G\", where S stands for \"The wug was sproinged\" and G stands for \"The wug was garpled\".\n\nNow, let's consider the given statement \"The wug was not sproinged\". This can be represented as \"~S\", where \"~\" stands for \"not\".\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"The wug was not garpled\", we need to use modus tollens, which allows us to draw a conclusion from the denial of the consequent. In this case, the modus tollens rule says that from \"S -> G\" and \"~G\", we can infer \"~S\".\n\nUsing modus tollens with \"S -> G\" and \"~S\", we can infer \"The wug was not garpled\".\n\nSo, based on the given statements and modus tollens, we can infer \"The wug was not garpled\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
