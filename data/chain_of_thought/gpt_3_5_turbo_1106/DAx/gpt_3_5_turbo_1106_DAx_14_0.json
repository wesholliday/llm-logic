The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\" is \"If the clug was not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked\".\n\nSo, based on the contrapositive, we can infer \"The clug was not snugged\" from \"The clug was not fleeked\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
