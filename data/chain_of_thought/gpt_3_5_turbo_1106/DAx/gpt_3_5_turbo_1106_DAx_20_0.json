Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, then we can infer that P is also false.\n\nApplying modus tollens to the given information:\n\n- If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\n- The fleeg was not bluttered.\n- Therefore, we can infer that the fleeg did not surn.\n\nNow, based on the reasoning above, can we infer \"The fleeg did not surn\"?\n\nAnswer: yes",
