It means that if the whiffle was shanked, then it tinked.\n\n2. \"The whiffle was not shanked\" - This statement tells us that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that the condition for the first statement (\"If the whiffle was shanked\") is not met. Therefore, we cannot conclude anything about whether the whiffle tinked or not.\n\nSo, can we infer \"The whiffle did not tink\" from the given statements?\n",
