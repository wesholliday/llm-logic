The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nSo, the contrapositive of the first statement is \"If the smonk was not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled.\"\n\nGiven that \"The smonk was not vreebled,\" we can infer from the contrapositive that \"The smonk was not plagged.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'yes'.",
