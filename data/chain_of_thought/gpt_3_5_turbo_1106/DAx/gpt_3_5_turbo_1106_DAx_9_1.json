The statement \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\" can be represented as: \"P -> V\" (where P is \"the twonk was plinked\" and V is \"the twonk was varnished\").\n\n2. The statement \"The twonk was not plinked\" can be represented as: \"~P\" (where ~P is \"not P\", or \"the twonk was not plinked\").\n\nSo, given \"P -> V\" and \"~P\", we want to determine if we can infer \"~V\".\n\nTo do this, we can use the law of syllogism, which states that if p -> q and q is false, then p must also be false.\n\nApplying this to the given statements:\n- \"P -> V\"\n- \"~P\"\n\nWe can infer: \"~V\" (the twonk was not varnished).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The twonk was not varnished.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
