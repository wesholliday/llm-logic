Modus tollens states that if we have the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, then we can infer that P is also false. In this case, \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\" is a conditional statement, and the premise \"The shank was not plooked\" allows us to conclude that \"The shank was not nugged\" only if we assume that the conditional statement is true.\n\nSo, let's consider the premises:\n1. If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged. (P \u2192 Q)\n2. The shank was not plooked. (~P)\n\nWe need to use modus tollens to see if we can infer \"The shank was not nugged\" based on the premises and logic.",
