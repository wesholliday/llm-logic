The second statement \"The dreb was not vroombed\" is a negation of the antecedent of the conditional statement.\n\nGiven these statements, we can use the law of detachment to make an inference. The law of detachment states that if a conditional statement is true and its hypothesis is true, then its conclusion is also true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\" and the hypothesis \"The dreb was not vroombed\" is true. Therefore, we can infer that \"The dreb was not spened.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
