We want to infer \"The clug was not snugged\" based on the given premises.\n\nTo infer whether \"The clug was not snugged\" is true based on the given information, we use the idea of the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" So, if we take the contrapositive of the given conditional statement (\"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\"), we get \"If the clug was not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked.\" \n\nGiven the premise \"The clug was not fleeked\", this means that \"The clug was not snugged\" is true based on the contrapositive.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises and using the idea of the contrapositive, we can infer that \"The clug was not snugged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
