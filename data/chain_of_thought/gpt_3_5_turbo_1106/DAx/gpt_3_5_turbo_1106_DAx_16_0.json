The original statement can be represented as: \"If P, then Q\" where P = the sneg was crampled and Q = the sneg sproted the frink.\n\n2. The additional information is \"The sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nNow, let's use the rule of inference called modus tollens, which states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"not Q,\" then we can infer \"not P.\"\n\nSo, applying modus tollens to the original statement and the additional information, we can infer \"The sneg did not sprot the frink.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
