Given the second statement, if the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the consequent (Kate ate the salad) must also be true. However, if the antecedent is false, the truth value of the consequent is undetermined.\n\nSince we know that Ben ate pasta (from the first statement), we can conclude that Kate ate the salad based on the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer 'Kate ate the salad'.",
