Modus Ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we also have the premise \"P\", then we can infer \"Q\". \n\nIn this case, the given statements \"The shirt was cotton\" and \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" form a conditional statement. The first statement is premise P, and the second statement is premise \"If P, then Q\". Therefore, using Modus Ponens, we can infer \"The pants were denim\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
