The first statement is that the book was written by James, and the second statement is a conditional statement that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. Given these two statements, we can apply modus ponens, which is a rule of inference, to conclude that the book is a mystery novel. This is because the first statement confirms the condition of the second statement. Therefore, the conclusion is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
