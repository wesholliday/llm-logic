If we combine the two statements, we can infer that the smonk was not vreebled. This is because if the smonk was vreebled, it would have had to plag according to the second statement. However, the first statement suggests that it might not have plagged, so it follows that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
