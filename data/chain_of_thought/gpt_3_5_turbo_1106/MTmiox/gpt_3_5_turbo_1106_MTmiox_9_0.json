From statement 2, we know that if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished.\n\nNow, let's consider the inference: \"The twonk was not plinked.\" If the twonk was not plinked, we cannot directly infer this from the given information. It's possible that the twonk was not plinked, but we cannot definitively conclude this based on the given statements.\n\nTherefore, the inference \"The twonk was not plinked\" cannot be made based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
