It states that if the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed.\n\nNow, let's use logical reasoning to determine if we can infer \"The flug was not blummed\" from the given information. \n\nIf the flug might not have been zimmed, and if the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed, it follows that the flug cannot be both blummed and not zimmed at the same time. Therefore, we can infer that \"The flug was not blummed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
