From statement 2, if the zinger was fraggled, then it must have been smoogled.\n\nNow, if we assume that the zinger was fraggled, then according to statement 2, it must have been smoogled. But this contradicts statement 1, which says it might not have been smoogled.\n\nSo, we can infer that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
