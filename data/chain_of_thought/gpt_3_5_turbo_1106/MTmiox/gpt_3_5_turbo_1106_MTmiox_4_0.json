From statement 2, we know that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked.\n\nNow, let's consider the inference: \"The fribble was not snurgled\". If the fribble was not snurgled, we cannot directly infer this from the given statements. It's possible that the fribble was not snurgled and did not crink, or it's possible that the fribble was not snurgled but still crinked. Therefore, we cannot make the inference that the fribble was not snurgled based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
