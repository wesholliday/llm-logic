It states that if the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged.\n\nNow, let's consider the inference we want to make: \"The shank was not plooked.\"\n\nTo make this inference, we can use the contrapositive of the second statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nSo, if we take the contrapositive of the second statement, it becomes: \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\"\n\nNow, combining the first statement \"The shank might not have been nugged\" with the contrapositive of the second statement, we can infer that \"The shank was not plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
