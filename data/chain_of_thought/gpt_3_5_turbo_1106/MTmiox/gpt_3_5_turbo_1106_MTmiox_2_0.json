It only tells us that it's possible the wug didn't bim the zoint.\n\nFrom statement 2, we can infer that if the wug was flooped, then it must have bimmed the zoint.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can't directly infer whether the wug was flooped or not. We can only infer that if the wug was flooped, then it must have bimmed the zoint.\n\nSo, we cannot infer \"The wug was not flooped\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
