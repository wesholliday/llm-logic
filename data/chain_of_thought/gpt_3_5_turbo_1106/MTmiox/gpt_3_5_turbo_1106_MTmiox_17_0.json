It can be rewritten as \"If the flob did not movate, then the flob was not skizzled\" using the contrapositive.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we cannot directly infer \"The flob was not skizzled\" because the first statement does not provide any information about the flob being skizzled or not skizzled. The first statement only provides a possibility, not a certainty.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The flob was not skizzled\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
