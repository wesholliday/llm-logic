It says that if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot directly infer whether the splat was morphed or not. The first statement does not provide any information about morphing, and the second statement only gives a condition for quanking if the splat was morphed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The splat was not morphed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
