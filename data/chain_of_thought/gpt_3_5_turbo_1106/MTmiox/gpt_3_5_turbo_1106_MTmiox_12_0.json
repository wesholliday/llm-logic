It is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q.\" In this case, P is \"the smip was shripped\" and Q is \"the smip must have lupped the zoint.\"\n\nGiven this information, we can infer that if the smip did not lup the zoint, then it was not shripped. However, we cannot directly infer that the smip was not shripped from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
