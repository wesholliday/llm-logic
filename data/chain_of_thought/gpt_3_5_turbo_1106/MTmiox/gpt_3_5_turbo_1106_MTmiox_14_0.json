It says that if the clug was fleeked, then it must have been snugged.\n\nNow, let's use logical reasoning to determine if we can infer \"The clug was not fleeked\" from the given statements. \n\nIf the clug was not snugged, it does not necessarily mean that it was not fleeked. It could still have been fleeked even if it was not snugged. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The clug was not fleeked\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
