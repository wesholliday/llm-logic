            "content": "Explanation: The original statement uses the conjunction \"and\" to connect two separate conditions: accuracy and submission by noon. This means that both conditions must be met. However, the second statement uses \"and\" to connect \"accurate\" and \"been submitted,\" which implies that accuracy and submission are part of the same action. Therefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: no",
