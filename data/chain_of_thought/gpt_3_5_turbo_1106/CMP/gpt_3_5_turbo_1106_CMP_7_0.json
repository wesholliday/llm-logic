    "user_prompt": "Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it\u2019s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn\u2019t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn\u2019t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?",

Wind power capacity is significantly behind the other two.\n\nNow, let's consider the conditional statement: \"if tidal power doesn\u2019t generate the most electricity, then if solar power doesn\u2019t, wind power will.\"\n\nGiven that tidal power is likely to generate the most electricity, the first part of the conditional statement is not relevant to the current situation. \n\nNext, let's consider the statement \"Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't.\"\n\nThis statement suggests that if tidal power generates the most electricity, then solar power is unlikely to do so.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?\"\n\nBased on the given information and the statement \"Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't,\" it does follow that if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power is likely to do so.\n\nAnswer: yes",
