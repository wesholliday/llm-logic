    "user_prompt": "Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?",

Make sure not to answer with 'Answer:' until *after* you think step by step and explain your reasoning.",

Paid family leave is next in probability.\n3. Student loan forgiveness is much less likely.\n\nNext, we are given the conditional statements:\n- If paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen.\n- A minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen.\n\nGiven these conditional statements, we can reason as follows:\n- If paid leave doesn't happen, it means that a minimum wage hike is likely to happen.\n- If a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen.\n\nSo, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, it's likely that loan forgiveness will happen based on the given conditional statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
