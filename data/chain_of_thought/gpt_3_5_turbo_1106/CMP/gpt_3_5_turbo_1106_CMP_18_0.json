    "user_prompt": "Suppose that pizza, burgers, and tacos are the most frequently ordered takeout foods. According to restaurant data, pizza likely will be the top takeout item ordered, followed by burgers, with tacos ordered much less frequently. These foods lead takeout orders, so if burgers aren\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn\u2019t, tacos will be. Moreover, pizza likely will lead takeout orders and hence burgers likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if pizza isn\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be?",

Tacos are ordered much less frequently than pizza and burgers.\n4. If burgers aren't the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn't, tacos will be.\n5. Pizza likely leads takeout orders, so burgers likely won't.\n\nGiven this information, if pizza isn't the top takeout item ordered, then burgers are also not the top takeout item ordered. This means that tacos would be the likely top takeout item ordered.\n\nSo, based on the given information, it is likely that if pizza isn't the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be.\n\nAnswer: yes",
