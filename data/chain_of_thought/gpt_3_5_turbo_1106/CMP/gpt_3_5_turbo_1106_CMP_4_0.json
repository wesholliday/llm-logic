    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it\u2019s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn\u2019t get the offer, then if Priya doesn\u2019t, Diego will. Moreover, it\u2019s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn\u2019t get the offer, Diego will?",

            "content": "First, let's consider the information given. The hiring manager thinks it's most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. This means Priya has the highest probability of getting the offer, followed by Julian, and then Diego.\n\nNext, we are told that if Julian doesn\u2019t get the offer, then if Priya doesn\u2019t, Diego will. This implies that if Julian is not offered the role, then it is certain that if Priya is not offered the role, Diego will be offered the role.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won\u2019t. This means that it's probable that Priya will get the offer, and therefore Julian is unlikely to get the offer.\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that if Priya doesn\u2019t get the offer, it is likely that Diego will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
