    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the flu, common cold, and strep throat are the most prevalent illnesses this season. Doctors expect the flu likely will infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind. These are the only major illnesses spreading, so if colds don\u2019t infect the most people, then if flu doesn\u2019t, strep will. Moreover, flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if flu doesn\u2019t infect the most, strep will?",

Doctors expect the flu to infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind.\n3. If colds don\u2019t infect the most people, then if flu doesn\u2019t, strep will.\n4. Moreover, flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won\u2019t.\n\nGiven this information, we can reason as follows:\n- If the flu doesn't infect the most people, then the common cold won't either, so strep will.\n- Since the flu is expected to infect the most people, the common cold is not likely to do so.\n\nNow, considering the given information and the reasoning, it follows that if the flu doesn't infect the most, strep will.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
