    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, and Beyonce have the top-selling albums this year. Industry experts project it's likely Taylor Swift's album will sell the most copies, followed closely by Bad Bunny's, with Beyonce's album far behind. These are the only top-sellers, so if Bad Bunny\u2019s album doesn\u2019t sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift\u2019s doesn\u2019t, Beyonce\u2019s will. Moreover, Taylor Swift\u2019s likely will sell the most and hence Bad Bunny's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if Taylor Swift's doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will?",

            "content": "First, let's consider the given information:\n1. Taylor Swift's album is likely to sell the most copies.\n2. Bad Bunny's album is likely to sell the second most copies, with Beyonce's album far behind.\n3. If Bad Bunny\u2019s album doesn\u2019t sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift\u2019s doesn\u2019t, Beyonce\u2019s will.\n4. Taylor Swift\u2019s likely will sell the most and hence Bad Bunny's likely won't.\n\nGiven these statements, if Taylor Swift's album doesn't sell the most copies, it follows that Bad Bunny's album also doesn't sell the most copies. This is based on the fact that Taylor Swift's album is likely to sell the most, and if it doesn't, then Bad Bunny's album won't either. \n\nNow, based on the given information, if Bad Bunny's album doesn't sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift\u2019s doesn\u2019t, Beyonce\u2019s will. This is a direct implication of the statement \"if Bad Bunny\u2019s album doesn\u2019t sell the most copies, then if Taylor Swift\u2019s doesn\u2019t, Beyonce\u2019s will.\"\n\nTherefore, it is likely that if Taylor Swift's album doesn't sell the most copies, Beyonce's will.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
