    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Ford, Toyota, and Honda lead US auto sales. Industry analysis expects Ford will sell the most vehicles this year, followed closely by Toyota, with Honda lagging significantly behind. These brands lead the market, so if Toyota isn\u2019t #1 in sales, then if Ford isn\u2019t, Honda will be. Moreover, Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Ford doesn\u2019t lead in sales, Honda will?",

            "content": "First, let's break down the information given:\n1. Ford is expected to sell the most vehicles this year.\n2. Toyota is expected to follow closely behind Ford.\n3. Honda is expected to lag significantly behind Ford and Toyota.\n4. If Toyota isn\u2019t #1 in sales, then if Ford isn\u2019t, Honda will be.\n5. Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota likely won\u2019t.\n\nGiven this information, if Ford doesn\u2019t lead in sales, it is likely that Honda will. This is because if Ford doesn\u2019t lead, then according to the statement \"If Toyota isn\u2019t #1 in sales, then if Ford isn\u2019t, Honda will be,\" it follows that Honda will be the leader if Ford isn\u2019t.\n\nAnswer: yes",
