    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",

Soda is consumed much less in the mornings.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement \"if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\" This statement is based on the premise that if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nGiven the information provided, we know that coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers, and tea is likely to have fewer morning drinkers than coffee. This means that if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, it's likely that tea won't either. \n\nSo, based on the given information, it is likely that if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nAnswer: yes",
