    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the stock market, real estate market, and bond market are the primary investment vehicles. According to financial advisors, the stock market likely will see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns. These markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn\u2019t have the highest returns, then if stocks don\u2019t, bonds will. Moreover, stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if stocks don\u2019t have the highest returns, bonds will?",

            "content": "First, let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Stock market likely will see the highest returns this year.\n2. Real estate market is expected to have returns lower than the stock market.\n3. Bonds are expected to have significantly lower returns compared to stocks and real estate.\n4. If real estate doesn\u2019t have the highest returns, then if stocks don\u2019t, bonds will.\n5. Stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won\u2019t.\n\nGiven the information, if stocks don\u2019t have the highest returns, then bonds will. This is based on the statement \"if real estate doesn\u2019t have the highest returns, then if stocks don\u2019t, bonds will.\" Additionally, the statement \"stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won\u2019t\" reinforces the idea that if stocks don\u2019t have the highest returns, then bonds will.\n\nTherefore, it follows that it\u2019s likely that, if stocks don\u2019t have the highest returns, bonds will.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
