    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don\u2019t increase the most, then if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won\u2019t increase the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

            "content": "First, let's consider the statement \"if home prices don\u2019t increase the most, then if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.\" This is a conditional statement, and it tells us that if home prices don't increase the most, then if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.\n\nNext, we are given the information that \"rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won\u2019t increase the most.\" This tells us that rents are likely to increase the most, and home prices are not likely to increase the most.\n\nNow, let's combine the two pieces of information. If rents don\u2019t increase the most, then mortgage rates will increase the most. We also know that rents are likely to increase the most and home prices are not likely to increase the most.\n\nGiven this information, it follows that if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.\n\nAnswer: yes",
