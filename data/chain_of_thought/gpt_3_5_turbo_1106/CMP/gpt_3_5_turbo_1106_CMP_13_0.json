    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": "First, let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Tennessee is projected to likely add the most jobs.\n2. Georgia is projected to follow closely behind Tennessee in job growth.\n3. Missouri's growth is significantly lower than Tennessee and Georgia.\n\nThe statement \"if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will\" indicates that if Georgia doesn't add the most jobs, then Tennessee is expected to do so. This aligns with the initial projection that Tennessee is likely to add the most jobs.\n\nThe statement \"Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t\" reinforces the expectation that Tennessee will lead in job growth, and Georgia will not add the most jobs.\n\nGiven this information, it does follow that if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will, as it is the only remaining option based on the initial projections and the subsequent statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
