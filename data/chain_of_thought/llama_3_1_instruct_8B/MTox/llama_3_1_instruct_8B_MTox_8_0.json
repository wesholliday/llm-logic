            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The sprocket was not cranked', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'The sprocket was not daggled', which directly tells us the state of the sprocket regarding being daggled. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled'. This statement implies that cranking the sprocket results in it being daggled. \n\nTo infer 'The sprocket was not cranked', we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. Since the first statement directly tells us the sprocket was not daggled, and the second statement implies that cranking the sprocket results in it being daggled, we can use a process of elimination. If the sprocket was cranked, it would be daggled according to the second statement, but we know it's not daggled according to the first statement. Therefore, it's logical to conclude that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
