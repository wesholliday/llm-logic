'The flob did not movated' - This statement tells us that the flob did not move.\n2. 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated' - This statement is a conditional statement that implies if the flob was skizzled, it would have moved.\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of logical reasoning:\n- We know the flob did not move (statement 1).\n- We know that if the flob was skizzled, it would have moved (statement 2).\n\nTo infer 'The flob was not skizzled', we need to consider the following:\n- If the flob was skizzled, it would have moved (statement 2).\n- However, we know the flob did not move (statement 1).\n- Therefore, it is likely that the flob was not skizzled, because if it was, it would have moved, but it didn't.\n\nThis is an example of a logical argument using modus tollens, a form of argument that takes the form: If A, then B. Not B. Therefore, not A.\n\nAnswer: yes",
