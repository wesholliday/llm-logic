'The fleeg did not surn'\n2. 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned'\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the fleeg did not surn. \n\nStatement 2 is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (the fleeg was bluttered) is true, then the consequence (it surned) is also true. However, we are given that the consequence (it surned) is not true (from statement 1). \n\nThis means that the condition (the fleeg was bluttered) must be false, because if it were true, the consequence (it surned) would also be true, which contradicts statement 1.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The fleeg was not bluttered'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
