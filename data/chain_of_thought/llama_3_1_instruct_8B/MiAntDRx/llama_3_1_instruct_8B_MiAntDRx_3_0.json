            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The fribble might be on the wumble' from the given statement, we need to analyze the relationship between the words in the original sentence. The original sentence is 'The fribble might be in the blurble or on the wumble'. The word 'or' is a conjunction that indicates an alternative, suggesting that the fribble could either be in the blurble or on the wumble. This implies that both options are possible, and there is no indication that one is more likely than the other. Therefore, if the fribble might be in the blurble, it is also possible that it might be on the wumble.\n\nAnswer: yes",
