The statement 'The frozz might be quork a flonk or zibble' suggests that 'quork a flonk' and 'zibble' are alternatives or possibilities for 'The frozz'. This implies that 'The frozz' can be either 'quork a flonk' or 'zibble'. Since 'zibble' is explicitly mentioned as a possibility for 'The frozz', we can infer that 'The frozz might be zibble'. \n\nAnswer: yes",
