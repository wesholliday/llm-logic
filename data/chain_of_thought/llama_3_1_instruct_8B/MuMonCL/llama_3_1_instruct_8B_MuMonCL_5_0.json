            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The package must have been delivered today and signed for' implies that the delivery of the package and the signing for it are two events that occurred together. The phrase 'and signed for' is a conjunction that indicates that the signing for the package happened at the same time as the delivery. However, it does not necessarily mean that the package was delivered today if it was signed for today. It could have been delivered earlier and signed for today. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The package must have been delivered today' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
