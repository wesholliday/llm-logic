            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The application must have been completed online' from 'The application must have been completed online and included references', we need to analyze the given statement. The statement explicitly states that the application was completed online, and it also mentions that it included references. The word 'and' is used to connect the two clauses, which implies that both conditions are necessary for the statement to be true. Since the first part of the statement directly states that the application was completed online, we can infer that this is a required condition. The inclusion of references is also a required condition, but it does not provide any additional information about the application being completed online. Therefore, we can safely infer that 'The application must have been completed online' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
