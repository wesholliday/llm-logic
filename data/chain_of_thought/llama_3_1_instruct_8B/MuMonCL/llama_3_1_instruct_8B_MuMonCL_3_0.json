            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The car must have been in the garage', let's break down the given statement. The statement 'The car must have been in the garage and needed repairs' implies two conditions: the car was in the garage and the car needed repairs. The word 'and' is a conjunction that connects two independent clauses, indicating that both conditions must be true. However, the statement does not provide any information that would rule out the possibility of the car being in the garage but not needing repairs. Therefore, we can infer that the car was in the garage, but we cannot be certain about the necessity of repairs without additional information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
