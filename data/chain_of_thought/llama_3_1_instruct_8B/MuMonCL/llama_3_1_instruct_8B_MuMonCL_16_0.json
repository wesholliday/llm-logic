            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The room must have been cleaned daily' from 'The room must have been cleaned daily and had fresh towels', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. The second statement provides additional information about the room, specifically that it had fresh towels. However, this information is not necessary for the first statement, which only mentions that the room was cleaned daily. The presence of fresh towels is a consequence of the room being cleaned daily, but it does not provide any new information about the frequency of cleaning. Therefore, we can infer the first statement from the second statement, but the second statement does not provide any new information that would change our understanding of the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
