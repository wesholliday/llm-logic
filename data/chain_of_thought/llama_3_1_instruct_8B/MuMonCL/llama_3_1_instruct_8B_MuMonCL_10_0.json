            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical inference, where we are trying to deduce a smaller statement from a larger one. The original statement 'The document must have been signed and notarized' is a compound statement that contains two conditions: 'signed' and 'notarized'. To infer 'The document must have been signed', we need to consider the relationship between the two conditions. \n\nIn this case, 'signed' is a necessary condition for 'notarized', because a document cannot be notarized unless it has been signed first. Therefore, if the document has been notarized, it must also have been signed. This is an example of a logical implication, where 'signed' is a prerequisite for 'notarized'. \n\nAnswer: yes",
