            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The splat was not morphed', let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked': This statement is a conditional statement, where 'if-then' relationship is established between 'the splat was morphed' and 'the splat must have quanked'. This means that if the condition 'the splat was morphed' is true, then the consequence 'the splat must have quanked' must also be true.\n\n2. 'The splat might not have quanked': This statement introduces uncertainty about whether the splat quanked or not. It does not provide any information about the morphing of the splat.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. We know that if the splat was morphed, it must have quanked. However, we also know that the splat might not have quanked. This creates a contradiction because if the splat was morphed, it must have quanked, but we are also told that it might not have quanked. This means that the condition 'the splat was morphed' cannot be true because if it were true, the consequence 'the splat must have quanked' would also be true, which contradicts the statement 'The splat might not have quanked'.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The splat was not morphed' because if it were morphed, it would have to quanked, but we know it might not have quanked, which creates a contradiction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
