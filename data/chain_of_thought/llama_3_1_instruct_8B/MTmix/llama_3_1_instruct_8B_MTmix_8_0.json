            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The sprocket was not cranked', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled' is a conditional statement. It implies that if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled. The second statement 'The sprocket might not have been daggled' is a statement of possibility, indicating that there is a chance the sprocket was not daggled.\n\nTo infer 'The sprocket was not cranked', we need to find a logical connection between the given statements and the conclusion. If the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled, but we also know that the sprocket might not have been daggled. This creates a contradiction because if the sprocket was cranked, it must have been daggled, but we are also given the possibility that it might not have been daggled. This suggests that the sprocket was not cranked, because if it was cranked, it would have been daggled, but we are given the possibility that it might not have been daggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
