The first statement 'The pen isn't on my desk' tells us that the pen is not in its usual or expected location. The second statement 'Either the pen is on my desk or it is in my bag' presents a binary choice for the pen's location. \n\nGiven that the pen is not on the desk, we can eliminate the first option in the second statement. This leaves us with the conclusion that the pen must be in the bag, as it is the only remaining option.\n\nAnswer: yes",
