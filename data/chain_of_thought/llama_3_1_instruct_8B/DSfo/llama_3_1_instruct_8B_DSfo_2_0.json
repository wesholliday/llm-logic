            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The book is on the shelf' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement 'The book isn't resting on the table' is a negation of the statement 'The book is resting on the table'. The second statement 'Either the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf' is a disjunction, which means it includes two possibilities: the book is on the table or it is on the shelf.\n\nGiven that the first statement negates the first part of the disjunction in the second statement, we can conclude that the second part of the disjunction, 'it is on the shelf', must be true. This is because if the first part of the disjunction is false (the book isn't resting on the table), the entire disjunction is true only if the second part is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
