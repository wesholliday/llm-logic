            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Fido is inside', let's break down the given statements. The first statement 'Fido is not in the garden' tells us that Fido is not in the garden. The second statement 'Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside' presents a disjunction, meaning it's a choice between two possibilities: Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside. \n\nHowever, we know from the first statement that Fido is not in the garden. Therefore, when we look at the second statement, the only remaining option is that Fido is inside. This is because the first statement eliminates the possibility of Fido being in the garden, leaving us with the only remaining option of Fido being inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
