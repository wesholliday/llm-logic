The statement 'The grooble must be snork' implies that the grooble has a specific characteristic or property, which is being 'snork'. However, there is no information provided about the grooble being 'zizz'. The word 'zizz' is not mentioned in the original statement, and its relationship to the grooble is unknown. Therefore, we cannot infer that the grooble must be 'zizz and be snork' because the original statement does not provide any information about the grooble being 'zizz'.\n\nAnswer: no",
