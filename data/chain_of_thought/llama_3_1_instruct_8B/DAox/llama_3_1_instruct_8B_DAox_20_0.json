This statement directly tells us the state of the fleeg regarding the property 'bluttered', which is that it is not bluttered.\n\nThe second statement is 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the fleeg being bluttered) is true, then the consequence (it surned) must also be true. However, this does not tell us anything about the fleeg's state regarding the property 'surned' when it is not bluttered.\n\nTo infer 'The fleeg did not surn', we need to know that the fleeg's state regarding 'surned' is dependent on its state regarding 'bluttered'. Since we know the fleeg is not bluttered, we can use the second statement to conclude that it did not surn, because the condition for it to surn (being bluttered) is not met.\n\nAnswer: yes",
