            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The dreb was not spened', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'The dreb was not vroombed'. This statement directly tells us that the dreb was not vroombed. The second statement is 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the dreb was vroombed) is true, then the consequence (the dreb was spened) must also be true. However, the first statement tells us that the condition (the dreb was vroombed) is not true. \n\nSince the condition is not true, we cannot conclude that the consequence (the dreb was spened) is true. However, we can conclude that we do not have enough information to determine if the dreb was spened or not. But since we know the dreb was not vroombed, we can use the first statement to infer that the dreb was not spened because if the dreb was spened, then it would have been vroombed according to the second statement. Therefore, we can conclude that the dreb was not spened.\n\nAnswer: yes",
