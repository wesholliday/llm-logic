            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The sprocket was not daggled', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'The sprocket was not cranked', which directly tells us the state of the sprocket regarding being cranked. The second statement is 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled', which is a conditional statement. This statement implies that being cranked and being daggled are related, but it does not directly tell us the state of the sprocket regarding being daggled.\n\nTo infer 'The sprocket was not daggled', we need to use the first statement and the second statement together. Since we know the sprocket was not cranked, and the second statement implies that being cranked leads to being daggled, we can conclude that the sprocket was not daggled because if it were cranked, it would be daggled, but it is not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
