            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The splat did not quank', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'The splat was not morphed'. This statement directly tells us the state of the splat regarding morphing. The second statement is 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked'. This is a conditional statement that implies a relationship between morphing and quanking. \n\nTo infer 'The splat did not quank', we need to establish a logical connection between the two statements. Since the first statement directly states that the splat was not morphed, we can use this information to evaluate the conditional statement. The conditional statement 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked' implies that morphing is a necessary condition for quanking. In other words, if the splat was morphed, it would quank. However, since we know the splat was not morphed, we can conclude that the condition for quanking (morphing) is not met.\n\nUsing the principle of contrapositive, we can infer that if the splat was not morphed, then it did not quank. This is because the condition for quanking (morphing) is not met, and therefore, quanking cannot occur. Therefore, we can logically infer that 'The splat did not quank'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
