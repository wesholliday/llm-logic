This is an 'or' condition, which means that the package could be delivered on either of the two days, but not necessarily on both. Therefore, if the package might be delivered today, it is already included in the condition of 'today or tomorrow'. This means that the statement 'The package might be delivered tomorrow' is a subset of the original statement, and it is indeed implied by it.\n\nAnswer: yes",
