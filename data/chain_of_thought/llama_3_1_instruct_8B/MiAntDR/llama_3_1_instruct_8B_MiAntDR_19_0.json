            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a process of elimination or a form of inference known as 'entailment' in logic. The original statement says 'The application might be completed online or in person', which means it includes both options as possibilities. When we take the first part of the statement, 'The application might be completed online or', we are left with 'in person'. Since 'or' is a disjunctive operator, it implies that if one option is true, the other option is also possible. Therefore, if 'The application might be completed online or in person', then it logically follows that 'The application might be completed in person' is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
