            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'The event might be formal or semi-formal' implies that there are two possible scenarios for the event: it could be formal or it could be semi-formal. The use of 'or' indicates that these are mutually exclusive options, meaning the event cannot be both formal and semi-formal at the same time. Therefore, if the event might be formal, it cannot be semi-formal, and if it might be semi-formal, it cannot be formal. However, the statement does not rule out the possibility of the event being semi-formal. In fact, it explicitly mentions semi-formal as one of the possibilities. Therefore, we can infer that the event might be semi-formal.\n\nAnswer: yes",
