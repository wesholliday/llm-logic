            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical inference, where we are trying to deduce a specific piece of information from a given statement. The original statement 'The document might be signed or notarized' implies that there are two possibilities: the document might be signed, or it might be notarized, or it might be both. The use of 'or' indicates that these are mutually exclusive options, but the statement does not exclude the possibility of both conditions being true. Therefore, if the document might be signed or notarized, it is reasonable to infer that it might indeed be notarized.\n\nAnswer: yes",
