            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'The project might be completed by Friday or extended' implies that there are two possible outcomes for the project: it might be completed by Friday, or it might be extended. The word 'or' is used to indicate a choice between two alternatives. Since 'extended' is one of the alternatives, it is reasonable to infer that the project might indeed be extended. This inference is based on the structure of the sentence, which presents 'extended' as a possible outcome alongside 'completed by Friday'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
