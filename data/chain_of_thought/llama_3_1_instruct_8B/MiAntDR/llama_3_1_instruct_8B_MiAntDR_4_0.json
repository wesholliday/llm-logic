            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The meeting might be cancelled' from 'The meeting might be at 2 PM or cancelled', let's break down the statement. The phrase 'might be at 2 PM or cancelled' implies that there are two possible scenarios for the meeting: it could either take place at 2 PM or it could be cancelled. The use of 'or' indicates that these are two separate possibilities, and the phrase 'might be' suggests that both scenarios are uncertain. Since 'cancelled' is one of the possible scenarios, it's reasonable to infer that the meeting might indeed be cancelled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
