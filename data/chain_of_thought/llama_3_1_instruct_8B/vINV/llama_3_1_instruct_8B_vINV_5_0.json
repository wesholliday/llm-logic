            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional statement, which can be broken down into two parts: the antecedent (the condition) and the consequent (the outcome). The given premise is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis', which can be written as P \u2192 Q (where P is 'Jeff played basketball' and Q is 'Amy played tennis'). The conclusion is 'If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis', which can be written as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ (where \u00acP is 'Jeff did not play basketball' and \u00acQ is 'Amy did not play tennis').\n\nTo check for logical validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. A valid argument is one where the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premise. In this case, the premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This does not provide any information about what happens if Jeff does not play basketball. The conclusion, however, makes a claim about what happens if Jeff does not play basketball. This is a different condition than the one stated in the premise.\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we can use a truth table or logical rules to analyze the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. However, a simpler way to approach this is to consider the following: if the premise is true, it does not necessarily follow that the conclusion is true. For example, if Jeff played basketball, Amy might have played tennis, but it's also possible that Amy did not play tennis. The premise does not provide any information about what happens if Jeff does not play basketball, so we cannot logically conclude that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\n\nIn fact, this argument is an example of a valid form of argument known as modus tollens, which is a valid argument form where the conclusion is the negation of the consequent of the premise. However, in this case, the premise is not in the form of P \u2192 Q, but rather in the form of P \u2192 Q, and the conclusion is in the form of \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ. This is a different form of argument, and it is not a valid form of modus tollens.\n\nHowever, the argument is actually an example of a valid form of argument known as contrapositive, which is a valid argument form where the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of the premise 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis' is 'If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball'. The conclusion 'If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis' is the contrapositive of the premise 'If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball'. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
