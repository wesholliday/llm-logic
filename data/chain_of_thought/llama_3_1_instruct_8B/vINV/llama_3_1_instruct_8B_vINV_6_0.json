            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional statement, which is typically represented as 'If P, then Q' (P \u2192 Q). The given premise is 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta' (Sue chose pizza \u2192 Bob chose pasta). The conclusion is 'If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta' (Sue did not choose pizza \u2192 Bob did not choose pasta).\n\nTo check for logical validity, we can use a truth table or analyze the argument's form. However, in this case, we can use a more intuitive approach. The conclusion is essentially the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning they have the same truth value.\n\nIn this case, the premise 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta' is equivalent to its contrapositive 'If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza'. The conclusion 'If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta' is the contrapositive of the premise 'If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza', which is not the same as the original premise. However, we can see that the conclusion is actually the contrapositive of the original premise's contrapositive, which is logically equivalent to the original premise.\n\nHowever, the original premise and the conclusion are not logically equivalent. The original premise is 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta', and the conclusion is 'If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta'. The original premise is not logically equivalent to the conclusion. The original premise and the conclusion are not logically equivalent, but the original premise and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. The conclusion is the contrapositive of the contrapositive of the original premise, which is logically equivalent to the original premise.\n\nHowever, the argument is actually logically valid because the conclusion is the contrapositive of the contrapositive of the original premise, which is logically equivalent to the original premise.",
