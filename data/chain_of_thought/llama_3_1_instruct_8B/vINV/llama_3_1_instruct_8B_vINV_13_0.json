            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional statement with two conditional statements. The first premise is 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue', which can be represented as 'P \u2192 Q'. The conclusion is 'If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue', which can be represented as '\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ'. \n\nTo check for logical validity, we can use a truth table or analyze the argument's form. The argument is an example of a contrapositive argument, where the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'P \u2192 Q' is '\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP'. \n\nIn this case, the premise is 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue', which is 'P \u2192 Q'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red', which is '\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP'. However, the conclusion is 'If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue', which is '\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ'. \n\nAlthough the conclusion is not the exact contrapositive of the premise, it is still a valid form of argument. The conclusion is the inverse of the contrapositive of the premise, which is also a valid form of argument. The inverse of a conditional statement 'P \u2192 Q' is '\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ'. \n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it follows a valid form of argument.\n\nAnswer: yes",
