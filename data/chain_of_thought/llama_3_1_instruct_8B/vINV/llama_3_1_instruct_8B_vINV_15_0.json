            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement and its contrapositive. The premise is 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train', which can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is 'Sam took a plane' and Q is 'Erin took a train'. The conclusion is 'If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train', which is the contrapositive of the premise, written as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ.\n\nA conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning that if the conditional statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa. This is a fundamental rule in logic, known as the contrapositive law. Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
