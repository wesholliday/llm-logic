            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement and its contrapositive. The premise is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', which can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is 'Mary was at the wedding' and Q is 'Sue was at the wedding'. The conclusion is 'If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding', which is the contrapositive of the premise, written as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are equivalent, meaning they have the same truth value. This is a fundamental property of conditional statements. Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nAnswer: yes",
