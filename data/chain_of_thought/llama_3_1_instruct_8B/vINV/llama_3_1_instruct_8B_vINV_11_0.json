            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional statement with two conditional statements. The first premise is 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry', which can be represented as 'P \u2192 Q'. The conclusion is 'If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry', which can be represented as '~P \u2192 ~Q'. \n\nTo check for logical validity, we can use a truth table or apply the rules of logical reasoning. In this case, we can use the rule that if P \u2192 Q is true, then ~P \u2192 ~Q is also true. This is because if P is false, then Q must be true for P \u2192 Q to be true. If Q is true, then ~Q must be false, and if ~P is true, then ~P \u2192 ~Q is also true.\n\nIn this argument, the first premise 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' is true, and the conclusion 'If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry' follows logically from it. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
