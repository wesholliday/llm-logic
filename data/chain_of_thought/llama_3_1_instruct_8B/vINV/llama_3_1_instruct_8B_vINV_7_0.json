            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional statement, which can be broken down into two parts: the antecedent (the \"if\" part) and the consequent (the \"then\" part). \n\nThe premise is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Alex finished the race\" and Q is \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\nThe conclusion is \"If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\" This can be written as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, where \u00acP is \"Alex did not finish the race\" and \u00acQ is \"Chris did not finish the race.\"\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion follows from the premise. We can do this by using a truth table or by analyzing the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nIn this case, the argument is an example of a contrapositive argument. The contrapositive of a conditional statement P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. Since the premise is P \u2192 Q and the conclusion is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, the argument is actually a valid form of a contrapositive argument.\n\nAnswer: yes",
