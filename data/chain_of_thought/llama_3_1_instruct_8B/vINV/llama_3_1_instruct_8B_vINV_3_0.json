            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional statement with two parts: the premise and the conclusion. The premise is 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel', which can be represented as 'P \u2192 Q', where P is 'the book was written by James' and Q is 'the book is a mystery novel'. The conclusion is 'If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel', which can be represented as '\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ'.\n\nTo check for logical validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. We can do this by using a truth table or by analyzing the argument's form. In this case, the argument is an example of a contrapositive argument, where the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'P \u2192 Q' is '\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP'. \n\nSince the premise is 'P \u2192 Q' and the conclusion is '\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP', which is the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid. This is because the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
