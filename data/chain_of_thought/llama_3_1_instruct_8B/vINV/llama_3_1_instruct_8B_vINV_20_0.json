            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional statement, which can be broken down into two parts: the antecedent (the condition) and the consequent (the outcome). \n\nThe premise is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'. This is a conditional statement where 'the apple was red' is the antecedent and 'the banana was yellow' is the consequent. \n\nThe conclusion is 'If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow'. This is also a conditional statement where 'the apple was not red' is the antecedent and 'the banana was not yellow' is the consequent.\n\nTo check for logical validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. We can do this by using a truth table or by analyzing the relationship between the antecedents and the consequents.\n\nIn this case, the argument is an example of a contrapositive argument. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. The contrapositive of the premise 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' is 'If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red'. However, the conclusion 'If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow' is not the contrapositive of the premise.\n\nHowever, we can still analyze the argument by looking at the relationship between the antecedents and the consequents. The premise states that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. This implies that the color of the banana is dependent on the color of the apple. If the apple is not red, then it could be any other color, and the premise does not provide any information about the color of the banana in that case.\n\nThe conclusion states that if the apple is not red, then the banana is not yellow. This is a valid conclusion because if the apple is not red, we cannot be certain about the color of the banana, but we can be certain that the banana is not yellow if the apple is not red.\n\nHowever, the argument is not a perfect example of a contrapositive argument, but it is still logically valid because it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The conclusion logically follows from the premise because the premise implies that the color of the banana is dependent on the color of the apple, and if the apple is not red, then we can be certain that the banana is not yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
