            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional statement with two conditional statements. The first premise is 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside', which can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is 'the dog was inside' and Q is 'the cat was outside'. The conclusion is 'If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside', which can be represented as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ.\n\nTo check for validity, we can use a truth table or logical equivalences. However, in this case, we can use a more intuitive approach. The argument is essentially saying that if the dog being inside implies the cat being outside, then the dog not being inside implies the cat not being outside. This is a form of contrapositive, which is a valid form of argument.\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. Since the given argument is in the form of a contrapositive, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
