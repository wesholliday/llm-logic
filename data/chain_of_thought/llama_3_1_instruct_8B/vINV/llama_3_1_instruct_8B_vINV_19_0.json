            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\n\nIf P, then Q\n\u2234 If not P, then not Q\n\nWhere P is 'Tom watched football' and Q is 'Jen watched basketball'. \n\nThis form is known as modus tollens, a valid form of argument in logic. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' and we know that P is false, then we can conclude that Q is also false. In this case, if Tom did not watch football (not P), then we can logically conclude that Jen did not watch basketball (not Q).\n\nAnswer: yes",
