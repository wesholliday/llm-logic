            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional statement, which can be broken down into two parts: the antecedent (the condition that comes first) and the consequent (the condition that follows). \n\nThe given premise is 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.' This is a conditional statement where 'the vampire was awake' is the antecedent and 'the mummy was awake' is the consequent. \n\nThe conclusion is 'If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.' This is also a conditional statement where 'the vampire was not awake' is the antecedent and 'the mummy was not awake' is the consequent.\n\nTo check for logical validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. We can do this by using a truth table or by analyzing the relationship between the antecedents and the consequents.\n\nIn this case, the argument is an example of a contrapositive argument. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A.' The contrapositive of the premise 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.' This is very close to the conclusion, but not exactly the same.\n\nHowever, the contrapositive of the premise is logically equivalent to the conclusion. This means that if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
