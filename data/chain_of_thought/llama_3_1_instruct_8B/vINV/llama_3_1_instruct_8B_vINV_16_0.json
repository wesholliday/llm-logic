            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional statement, which can be broken down into two parts: the antecedent (the \"if\" part) and the consequent (the \"then\" part). \n\nThe given premise is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This can be written as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim.\" \n\nThe conclusion is \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\" This can be written as ~P \u2192 ~Q, where ~P is \"the shirt was not cotton\" and ~Q is \"the pants were not denim.\"\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. This can be done by using a truth table or by analyzing the logical relationships between the statements.\n\nIn this case, the argument is an example of a contrapositive argument, where the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a conditional statement P \u2192 Q is ~Q \u2192 ~P. \n\nSince the premise is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" (P \u2192 Q), its contrapositive is \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\" (~Q \u2192 ~P). However, the conclusion is \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim\" (~P \u2192 ~Q), which is not the contrapositive of the premise.\n\nHowever, we can still analyze the argument by using the rule of contrapositive inference, which states that if P \u2192 Q, then ~Q \u2192 ~P. This rule is a valid form of argument, and it is the form of the given argument.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
