            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional statement, which can be broken down into two parts: the antecedent (the condition that must be true for the statement to be true) and the consequent (the outcome or result of the condition being true). \n\nThe given premise is 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.' This is a conditional statement where 'the bear was in the cave' is the antecedent and 'the wolf was in the den' is the consequent. \n\nThe conclusion is 'If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.' This is also a conditional statement where 'the bear was not in the cave' is the antecedent and 'the wolf was not in the den' is the consequent.\n\nTo check for logical validity, we need to see if the conclusion follows from the premise. We can do this by using a truth table or by analyzing the relationship between the antecedents and the consequents.\n\nIn this case, the premise and the conclusion are related through a process called contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A.' The premise and the conclusion are contrapositives of each other.\n\nSince the premise and the conclusion are contrapositives, they are logically equivalent, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
