            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional statement, which can be broken down into two parts: the antecedent (the condition) and the consequent (the outcome). \n\nThe premise is 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'. This is a conditional statement where 'Joe went to the park' is the antecedent and 'Lucy went to the zoo' is the consequent. \n\nThe conclusion is 'If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo'. This is also a conditional statement where 'Joe did not go to the park' is the antecedent and 'Lucy did not go to the zoo' is the consequent.\n\nTo check for logical validity, we need to see if the conclusion follows from the premise. We can do this by using a truth table or by analyzing the relationship between the antecedents and the consequents.\n\nIn this case, the argument is an example of a contrapositive argument. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. The contrapositive of the premise is 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park'. This is logically equivalent to the conclusion 'If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo'.\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, it is logically equivalent to the premise. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
