            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows a valid logical structure. The argument is a conditional statement with two conditional statements. The first premise is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal', which can be represented as P \u2192 Q (where P is 'the doll was plastic' and Q is 'the truck was metal'). The conclusion is 'If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal', which can be represented as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ.\n\nTo check for validity, we can use a truth table or logical equivalences. However, in this case, we can use a more intuitive approach. We can try to find a counterexample or use a logical equivalence to transform the argument into a more familiar form.\n\nThe argument can be transformed using the contrapositive of the first premise, which is 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic' (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP). We can then use the contrapositive of the conclusion, which is 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic' (Q \u2192 P).\n\nNow, we can see that the argument is actually a form of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: If P \u2192 Q, then \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. In this case, we have P \u2192 Q (the first premise) and \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP (the contrapositive of the conclusion), which is equivalent to the contrapositive of the first premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
