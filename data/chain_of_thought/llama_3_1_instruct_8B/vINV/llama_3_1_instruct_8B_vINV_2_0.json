            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional statement, which can be broken down into two parts: the antecedent (the \"if\" part) and the consequent (the \"then\" part). \n\nThe given premise is \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This is a conditional statement where the antecedent is \"the griffin was in the forest\" and the consequent is \"the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\nThe conclusion is \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\" This is also a conditional statement where the antecedent is \"the griffin was not in the forest\" and the consequent is \"the unicorn was not in the forest.\"\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. We can do this by using a truth table or by analyzing the relationship between the antecedents and the consequents.\n\nIn this case, the argument is an example of a contrapositive argument. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" The contrapositive of the premise is \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\" This is logically equivalent to the conclusion.\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, it is logically equivalent to the premise. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
