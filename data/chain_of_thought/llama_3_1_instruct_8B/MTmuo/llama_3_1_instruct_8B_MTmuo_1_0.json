            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Mary was not at the wedding', let's analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding'. This statement implies that Sue's presence at the wedding is not a necessity or a requirement. The second statement is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding'. This is a conditional statement indicating a relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence at the wedding.\n\nTo infer 'Mary was not at the wedding', we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. If Mary's presence at the wedding implies Sue's presence, and Sue's presence is not a necessity, it doesn't necessarily mean Mary was not at the wedding. However, if we combine these statements, we can see that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary could have been at the wedding without Sue being there. But the statements do not directly imply that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nHowever, we can use a logical rule called 'modus tollens' to analyze this situation. Modus tollens states that if 'if A then B' and 'not B', then 'not A'. In this case, 'if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding' is 'if A then B', and 'it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding' is 'not B'. Using modus tollens, we can conclude that 'not A', which means 'Mary was not at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
