            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The doll was not plastic', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement, 'It's not the case that the truck must have been metal', can be rewritten as 'The truck might not have been metal'. This statement does not provide any information about the material of the doll. The second statement, 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal', is a conditional statement. It implies that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal, but it does not provide any information about the material of the doll when the truck is not metal.\n\nTo infer 'The doll was not plastic', we need to find a situation where the doll is plastic and the truck is not metal. However, the second statement does not provide any information about the truck's material when the doll is not plastic. Therefore, we cannot directly infer the material of the doll from the given statements.\n\nHowever, we can use the first statement to infer that the truck might not be metal. If the truck is not metal, it does not necessarily mean the doll is not plastic, but it does not rule out the possibility that the doll is not plastic either. The key point is that the second statement only provides a condition for when the doll is plastic, not when it is not plastic.\n\nConsidering the information provided, we cannot directly infer 'The doll was not plastic' because the statements do not provide a direct link between the doll's material and the truck's material when the truck is not metal.\n\nAnswer: no",
