This statement can be rewritten as 'Lucy might not have gone to the zoo' or 'It's possible that Lucy did not go to the zoo'. This statement does not provide any direct information about Joe's actions.\n\nThe second statement is 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo'. This statement implies a conditional relationship between Joe's action (going to the park) and Lucy's action (going to the zoo). However, it does not provide any information about the converse, i.e., if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe must have gone to the park.\n\nTo infer 'Joe did not go to the park', we would need to know that Lucy did go to the zoo, which would create a contradiction with the first statement. However, we cannot directly infer this from the given statements. The statements do not provide a direct link between Lucy's action and Joe's action in both directions.\n\nHowever, we can use the first statement to infer that it is possible that Lucy did not go to the zoo. If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then the second statement does not provide any information about Joe's action. In this case, we cannot conclude that Joe did not go to the park, as there is no direct link between Lucy's action and Joe's action.\n\nHowever, we can use the first statement to infer that it is possible that Lucy did not go to the zoo. If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then the second statement does not provide any information about Joe's action. In this case, we cannot conclude that Joe did not go to the park, as there is no direct link between Lucy's action and Joe's action. However, we can use the first statement to infer that it is possible that Joe did not go to the park, because if Lucy did not go to the zoo, then it is possible that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
