            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The book was not written by James', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel' implies that the book does not necessarily have to be a mystery novel. The second statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel' implies that if the book was written by James, it would be a mystery novel. \n\nTo infer 'The book was not written by James', we need to find a logical contradiction or a situation where the two statements cannot coexist. If the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel (second statement). However, the first statement says that the book does not necessarily have to be a mystery novel. This creates a contradiction because if the book was written by James, it would be a mystery novel, but the first statement says it's not necessarily a mystery novel. \n\nHowever, this is not a direct contradiction. The first statement is saying that the book does not necessarily have to be a mystery novel, but it does not say that it cannot be a mystery novel. It's possible that the book is a mystery novel, but it's not necessary. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that the book was not written by James from the given statements.\n\nHowever, we can use a logical rule called 'Modus Tollens' which states that if 'If P then Q' and 'Not Q', then 'Not P'. In this case, 'P' is 'The book was written by James' and 'Q' is 'The book must be a mystery novel'. We have 'If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel' (If P then Q) and 'It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel' (Not Q). Using Modus Tollens, we can conclude that 'Not P', which is 'The book was not written by James'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
