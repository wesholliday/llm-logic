            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The shirt was not cotton', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'It's not the case that the pants must have been denim', which means the pants could be either denim or not denim. The second statement is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim', which implies that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim. \n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. If the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim (from the second statement). However, the first statement says it's not the case that the pants must have been denim, which contradicts this scenario. Therefore, the shirt cannot be cotton.\n\n2. If the shirt is not cotton, then there is no requirement for the pants to be denim (from the first statement). This scenario does not contradict the first statement.\n\nSince we have a contradiction when the shirt is cotton, we can conclude that the shirt is not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
