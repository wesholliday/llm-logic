            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt' implies that Mark may or may not have bought the blue shirt. The second statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt' implies a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. \n\nTo infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt', we need to find a contradiction or a logical inconsistency if Lisa bought the red shirt. However, the given statements do not provide any direct information about Lisa's action. The first statement does not provide any information about Lisa's action, and the second statement only provides a conditional relationship between Lisa's and Mark's actions.\n\nHowever, we can use a process of elimination and logical reasoning to infer that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. But the first statement tells us that it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This implies that Mark may not have bought the blue shirt. Therefore, if Mark may not have bought the blue shirt, then it's possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt because if she did, Mark would have had to buy the blue shirt, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
