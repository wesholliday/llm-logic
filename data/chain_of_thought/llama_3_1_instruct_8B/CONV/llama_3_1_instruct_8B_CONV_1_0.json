            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical inference using the concept of contrapositive. The original statement is in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'Mary was at the wedding' and Q is 'Sue was at the wedding'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If not Q, then not P', which is 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding'. \n\nHowever, the question asks for the inference of 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding', which is the converse of the original statement, not the contrapositive. The converse of 'If P, then Q' is 'If Q, then P'. \n\nIn general, we can infer the converse of a statement from the original statement, but we cannot infer the converse from the contrapositive. The contrapositive is a logically equivalent statement, but the converse is not. Therefore, we cannot logically infer 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
