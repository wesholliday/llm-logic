            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical inference using the concept of contrapositive. The original statement is in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'Alex finished the race' and Q is 'Chris finished the race'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If not Q, then not P', which is 'If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race'. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race', we need to find the inverse of the original statement, which is 'If not P, then not Q', or 'If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race'. The contrapositive and the inverse are logically equivalent, but the converse (which is 'If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race') is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nHowever, we can use the original statement to infer the contrapositive, which is 'If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race'. This is because the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. But we cannot directly infer the converse from the original statement.\n\nHowever, we can use the contrapositive to infer the converse. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can use the contrapositive to infer the converse. The contrapositive is 'If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race'. If we negate both sides of this statement, we get 'If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race'. This is the converse of the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
