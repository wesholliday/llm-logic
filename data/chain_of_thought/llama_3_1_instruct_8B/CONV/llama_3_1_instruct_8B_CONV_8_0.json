            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical inference using the concept of contrapositive. The given statement is 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake'. This is a conditional statement in the form 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the vampire was awake' and Q is 'the mummy was awake'. \n\nTo infer 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake', we need to find the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. \n\nSo, the contrapositive of the given statement is 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake'. This is not the same as 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake'. \n\nHowever, we can find the original statement's converse, which is 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake'. The converse of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If Q, then P'. \n\nThe converse is not logically equivalent to the contrapositive, and we cannot infer the converse from the given statement.",
