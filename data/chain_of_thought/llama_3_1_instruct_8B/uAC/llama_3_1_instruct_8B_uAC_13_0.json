            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that the car was red, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the car being red) is true, then the consequence (the truck being blue) is also true. The second statement is \"The truck was blue.\" This statement directly states the consequence of the first statement, which is that the truck is indeed blue.\n\nNow, let's break it down further. The first statement is a conditional statement, and the second statement confirms the consequence of that condition. However, it does not directly state the condition (the car being red). To infer that the car was red, we would need to know that the condition (the car being red) is true. But the second statement only confirms the consequence (the truck being blue), not the condition.\n\nHowever, since the second statement directly confirms the consequence of the first statement, and the first statement is a conditional statement, we can conclude that the condition (the car being red) must be true in order for the consequence (the truck being blue) to be true. Therefore, we can infer that the car was red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
