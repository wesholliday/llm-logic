            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that Lisa bought the red shirt, we need to analyze the given information. The first statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the consequence (Mark bought the blue shirt) is also true. However, the second statement \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" does not necessarily mean that the condition (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true. It only confirms the consequence of the first statement. Therefore, we cannot be certain that Lisa bought the red shirt based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
