            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that the vampire was awake, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement says that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This is a conditional statement, which means that the presence of the vampire being awake is a sufficient condition for the mummy to be awake. The second statement directly states that the mummy was awake. \n\nSince the mummy was awake, we can use the first statement to infer that the vampire must have been awake as well, because the condition for the mummy being awake (the vampire being awake) is met. This is an example of a logical implication, where the truth of the second statement (the mummy being awake) supports the truth of the first statement (the vampire being awake).\n\nAnswer: yes",
