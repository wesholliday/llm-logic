            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that the apple was red, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the consequence (the banana being yellow) is also true. However, this does not necessarily mean that the banana being yellow is a direct result of the apple being red. It's more like a correlation between the two.\n\nThe second statement \"The banana was yellow\" is a fact. It tells us that the banana is indeed yellow.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that the apple was red based on these two statements. Since the banana being yellow is a consequence of the apple being red (from the first statement), and we know the banana is indeed yellow (from the second statement), we can use the first statement to infer that the apple must have been red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
