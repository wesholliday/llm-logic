            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that the book was written by James, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" establishes a conditional relationship between the two statements. This means that if the condition (the book was written by James) is true, then the consequence (the book is a mystery novel) is also true. The second statement \"the book is a mystery novel\" is a fact that we know to be true. \n\nNow, we need to see if we can logically conclude that the book was written by James. To do this, we can use a process called modus ponens, which is a form of deductive reasoning. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"if A then B\" and we know that B is true, then we can conclude that A is true. In this case, the conditional statement is \"if the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" and we know that the book is a mystery novel. Therefore, we can use modus ponens to conclude that the book was written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
