If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n2. Sue was at the wedding.\n\nWe can analyze the first statement as a conditional statement, where the condition is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and the consequence is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that if the condition is true, the consequence must also be true.\n\nGiven that the second statement \"Sue was at the wedding\" is true, we can use the first statement to infer that the condition \"Mary was at the wedding\" must also be true, because the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) is indeed true.\n\nTherefore, we can logically conclude that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
