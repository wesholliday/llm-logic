This statement implies a location or a place where the bimboozle is required to be. However, it does not provide any information about the bimboozle's state or condition, such as being in another location. The statement only specifies one location, which is 'snorkel quank'. \n\nTo infer that the bimboozle must also be in the flump quazzle, we would need additional information that links the two locations or provides a relationship between them. The given statement does not provide this information, so we cannot make a logical conclusion about the bimboozle's presence in the flump quazzle.\n\nAnswer: no",
