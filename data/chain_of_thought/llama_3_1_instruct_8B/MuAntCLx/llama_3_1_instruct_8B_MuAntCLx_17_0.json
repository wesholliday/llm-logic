The original statement is a simple assertion that the froodle must be flump. This statement does not provide any additional information about the froodle's relationship with 'glorp' or 'frazzle'.\n\nThe additional information 'be glorp by frazzle' introduces a new condition that is not present in the original statement. This condition implies a specific action or relationship between 'frazzle' and 'glorp', but it does not provide any direct connection to the original statement about the froodle being flump.\n\nSince the original statement does not provide any information about the froodle's relationship with 'glorp' or 'frazzle', we cannot infer that the froodle must be flump and be glorp by frazzle from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
