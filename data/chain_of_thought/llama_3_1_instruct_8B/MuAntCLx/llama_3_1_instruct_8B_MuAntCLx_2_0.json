This statement is a conditional statement, but it does not provide any information about the bimboozle's actions or any other related activities like froodling a wobble quank. It only states a condition about the bimboozle's location, which is on the plonk. \n\nThere is no logical connection between the bimboozle being on the plonk and the action of froodling a wobble quank. Therefore, we cannot infer that the bimboozle must be on the plonk and froodle a wobble quank based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
