            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The sprocket was cranked' from the given statements, we need to analyze the relationship between 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled' and 'The sprocket was daggled'. \n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the sprocket was cranked) is met, then the consequence (the sprocket was daggled) will follow. This is a classic example of a 'if-then' statement.\n\nThe second statement simply states that the sprocket was daggled.\n\nTo infer 'The sprocket was cranked', we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. Since the first statement is a conditional, we can use the concept of modus ponens, which states that if we know the condition is true and the consequence is true, then the condition must be true.\n\nIn this case, we know the consequence (the sprocket was daggled) is true, and we have a conditional statement that links the condition (the sprocket was cranked) to the consequence. Therefore, we can logically infer that the condition (the sprocket was cranked) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
