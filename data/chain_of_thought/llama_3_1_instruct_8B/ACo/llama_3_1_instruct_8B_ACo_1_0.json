            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Mary was at the wedding', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Sue was at the wedding' is a direct statement, but it doesn't provide any information about Mary. The second statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement. This statement implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue's presence at the wedding is a guaranteed consequence. However, it does not imply that Sue's presence at the wedding is a consequence of Mary's absence. Therefore, we cannot directly infer 'Mary was at the wedding' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
