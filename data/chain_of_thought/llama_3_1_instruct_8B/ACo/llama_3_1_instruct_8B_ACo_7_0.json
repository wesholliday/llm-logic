The first statement is 'Chris finished the race', which simply states a fact about Chris. The second statement is a conditional statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race'. This statement implies that if the condition (Alex finished the race) is true, then the consequence (Chris finished the race) is also true.\n\nHowever, the first statement 'Chris finished the race' does not provide any information about Alex. It only tells us about Chris's action. The conditional statement does not provide any information about whether Alex finished the race or not. It only tells us what would happen if Alex finished the race.\n\nSince we do not have any information about Alex finishing the race, we cannot infer that Alex finishes the race from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
