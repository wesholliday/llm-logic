The statement 'The movie must have had subtitles' implies that the movie was not in the native language of the audience or the primary language of the production. This is because subtitles are typically used to translate or transcribe dialogue or other audio elements for viewers who do not understand the primary language of the content. However, it does not necessarily imply that the movie was in English. It could have been in any language other than the native language of the audience or the primary language of the production. Therefore, we cannot infer that the movie must have been in English and had subtitles.\n\nAnswer: no",
