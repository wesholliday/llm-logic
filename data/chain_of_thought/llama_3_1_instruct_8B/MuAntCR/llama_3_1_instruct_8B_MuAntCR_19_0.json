This statement implies that the application had some form of references, but it does not provide information about how the application was submitted or completed. \n\nTo infer that the application was completed online, we would need additional information, such as 'The application was submitted online' or 'The application was completed online'. However, the given statement does not provide this information. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the application was completed online.\n\nHowever, we can infer that the application included references, as this is explicitly stated in the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
