This statement only provides information about the start time of the concert, which is 8 PM. It does not provide any information about the ticket sales or the number of attendees. Therefore, we cannot infer that the concert must have been sold out, as sold out status is not related to the start time. We can only confirm that the concert started at 8 PM.\n\nAnswer: no",
