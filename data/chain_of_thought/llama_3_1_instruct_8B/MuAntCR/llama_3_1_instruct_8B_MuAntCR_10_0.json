            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The document must have been signed and notarized' from 'The document must have been notarized', let's break down the information given. 'Notarized' typically implies that a document has been verified by a notary public, which is a separate step from signing the document itself. However, in many jurisdictions, notarization often requires the document to be signed in the presence of the notary. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that a document that has been notarized has also been signed, as the notarization process usually involves witnessing the signature. However, it's essential to note that not all notarization processes require a signature, and some may involve other forms of verification. Nonetheless, in many cases, it's a safe assumption that a notarized document has been signed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
