In this context, 'or' is used to connect the two possibilities 'blurble' and 'grooble'. This suggests that the speaker is presenting two separate options for what 'the frazzle' might be. The use of 'or' implies that these are mutually exclusive possibilities, meaning that 'the frazzle' can either be 'blurble' or 'grooble', but not both at the same time.\n\nAnswer: yes",
