    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": "Explanation: To determine if it follows that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers, we need to analyze the given information and the logical connections between the statements. \n\nFirst, we know that coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, and then soda. This establishes a ranking of the three beverages. \n\nWe are also given that if tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. This statement implies a conditional relationship between the retention of morning drinkers by tea and soda, given that coffee doesn't retain the most.\n\nHowever, we are asked to determine if it follows that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. This is a different conditional statement than the one provided. The original statement only guarantees that if tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. It does not directly address the scenario where coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nGiven that coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers, and tea is likely to retain the second most, it is possible that tea could retain the most morning drinkers if coffee's retention rate drops significantly. In this case, soda would not retain the most morning drinkers, even if coffee doesn't retain the most.\n\nTherefore, the given information does not necessarily imply that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nAnswer: no",
