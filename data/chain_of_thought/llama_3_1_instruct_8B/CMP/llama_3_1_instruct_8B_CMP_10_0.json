    "user_prompt": "Suppose that spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons. Forecasts show it's likely most vacations this year will happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with many fewer happening in the winter. These are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. Moreover, spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": "Explanation: The given information states that spring is the most popular travel season, followed by summer, and then winter. This implies that spring has the most vacations, followed by summer, and then winter. The statement also mentions that if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then winter will, which is a direct consequence of the initial information. However, the statement that if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will, is not necessarily true. This is because the initial information only guarantees that if spring doesn't have the most vacations, then winter will have the most vacations, not that it's likely. The word \"likely\" introduces uncertainty and probability, which is not directly supported by the given information. The initial information only provides a clear ranking of the seasons by the number of vacations, without any probabilistic statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
