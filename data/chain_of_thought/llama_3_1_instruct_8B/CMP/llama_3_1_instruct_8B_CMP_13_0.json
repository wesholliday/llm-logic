    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": "Explanation: To determine if it follows that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will, we need to analyze the given information and the relationships between the states' job growth. We are given that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth in the US, with Tennessee likely to add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, and Missouri's growth being significantly lower. We also know that if Georgia doesn't add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn't, Missouri will. Additionally, we are told that Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won't.\n\nFrom the given information, we can infer that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, it must be because Georgia has added the most jobs, since Tennessee is expected to add the most jobs. However, we are also told that Georgia likely won't add the most jobs, which means that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, it's not necessarily because Georgia has added the most jobs. In this case, it could be because Missouri has added the most jobs.\n\nTherefore, the given information does not necessarily imply that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will. There is an alternative scenario where Georgia adds the most jobs, and in that case, Missouri won't.\n\nAnswer: no",
