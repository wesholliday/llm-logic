The first statement 'Either the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf' presents two possible scenarios for the book's location. The second statement 'The book isn't resting on the table' eliminates one of the possibilities from the first statement, leaving us with only one option. \n\nSince the second statement directly eliminates the possibility of the book being on the table, we can conclude that the book must be on the shelf, as it is the only remaining option from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
