            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is a disjunction, which means it presents two possible alternatives: the remote control is either under the couch or on the coffee table. The second statement explicitly states that the remote control is not under the couch. \n\nGiven that the remote control is not under the couch, we can eliminate one of the alternatives in the disjunction. Since the remote control is not under the couch, it must be on the coffee table, as that is the only remaining alternative.\n\nAnswer: yes",
