            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The truck was not blue' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' is a conditional statement. It implies that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. However, it does not say anything about the color of the truck if the car is not red.\n\nThe second statement 'The car was not red' is a simple statement that tells us the color of the car. \n\nTo infer 'The truck was not blue', we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. Since the first statement is a conditional, we can use the rule of contrapositive to find the opposite. The contrapositive of 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. In this case, the contrapositive of 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' is 'If the truck was blue, then the car was red'.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly apply this contrapositive to the second statement 'The car was not red' because it does not tell us anything about the color of the truck. We only know that the car is not red, but we do not know if the truck is blue or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The truck was not blue' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
