            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Lucy did not go to the zoo', we need to analyze the given statements and their logical connections. The first statement 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (Joe went to the park) is true, then the consequence (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true. However, the second statement 'Joe did not go to the park' is a negation of the condition in the first statement. \n\nSince the condition (Joe went to the park) is not met, we cannot conclude that the consequence (Lucy went to the zoo) must be true. In fact, we cannot conclude anything about Lucy's actions because the condition that would lead us to that conclusion is not met. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Lucy did not go to the zoo' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
