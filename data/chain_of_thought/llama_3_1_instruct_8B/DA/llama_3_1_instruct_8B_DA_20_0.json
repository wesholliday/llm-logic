            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The banana was not yellow', we need to analyze the given statements and their logical connections. The first statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' is a conditional statement. It implies that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the consequence (the banana being yellow) must also be true. However, this does not imply that the banana is yellow if the apple is not red. The second statement 'The apple was not red' is a simple statement that provides information about the apple's color. \n\nTo infer 'The banana was not yellow', we would need a statement that directly connects the apple's color to the banana's color when the apple is not red. However, the given statements do not provide such a connection. The first statement only provides a conditional relationship between the apple's and banana's colors when the apple is red, not when it's not red. Therefore, we cannot directly infer the banana's color based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
