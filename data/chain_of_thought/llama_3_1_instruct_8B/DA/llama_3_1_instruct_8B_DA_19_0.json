            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Jen did not watch basketball', we need to analyze the given statements and their logical implications. The first statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequence (Jen watched basketball) must also be true. However, the second statement 'Tom did not watch football' tells us that the condition is not met. \n\nSince the condition is not met, we cannot conclude that Jen watched basketball, as the conditional statement does not provide any information about what happens when the condition is not true. It only tells us what happens when the condition is true. Therefore, we cannot infer that Jen did not watch basketball from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
