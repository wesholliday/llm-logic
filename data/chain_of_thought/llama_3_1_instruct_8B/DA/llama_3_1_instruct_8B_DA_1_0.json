            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Sue was not at the wedding', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue was at the wedding) is also true. However, this does not imply that if Mary was not at the wedding, Sue was not at the wedding. The second statement 'Mary was not at the wedding' is a fact, but it does not provide any information about Sue's presence at the wedding. \n\nTo infer 'Sue was not at the wedding', we would need a statement that directly contradicts the conditional statement, such as 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding'. However, we do not have such a statement. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Sue was not at the wedding' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
