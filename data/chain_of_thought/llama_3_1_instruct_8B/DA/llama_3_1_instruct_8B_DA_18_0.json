            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The truck was not metal', we need to analyze the given statements and their logical connections. \n\nThe first statement is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'. This is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (the doll being plastic) is true, then the consequence (the truck being metal) must also be true. However, this does not provide any information about the truck's material if the doll is not plastic.\n\nThe second statement is 'The doll was not plastic'. This statement directly contradicts the condition in the first statement, which means the condition (the doll being plastic) is not met.\n\nSince the condition in the first statement is not met, we cannot conclude the consequence (the truck being metal) is true. However, we cannot conclude the truck is not metal either, because the first statement only provides a relationship between the doll and the truck under a specific condition, and that condition is not met.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the truck's material based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
