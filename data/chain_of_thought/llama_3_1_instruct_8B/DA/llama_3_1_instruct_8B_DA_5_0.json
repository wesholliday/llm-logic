            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Amy did not play tennis', we need to analyze the given statements and their logical implications. The first statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis' is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the consequence (Amy playing tennis) must also be true. However, this does not imply that if the condition is false, the consequence must be false. \n\nThe second statement 'Jeff did not play basketball' is a negation of the condition in the first statement. Since the condition is false, we cannot directly conclude that the consequence (Amy playing tennis) is false. The conditional statement does not provide any information about what happens when the condition is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that Amy did not play tennis based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
