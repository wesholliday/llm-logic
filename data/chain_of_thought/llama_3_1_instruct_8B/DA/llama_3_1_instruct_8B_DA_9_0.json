            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the consequence (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true. However, the second statement 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' tells us that the condition of the first statement is not met. \n\nSince the condition is not met, we cannot conclude that Mark bought the blue shirt. However, we cannot directly conclude that Mark did not buy the blue shirt either, because the conditional statement does not cover the case where Lisa did not buy the red shirt. It only tells us what happens if Lisa bought the red shirt, not what happens if she didn't. Therefore, we cannot infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
