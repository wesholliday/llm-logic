            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The book is not a mystery novel' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. \n\nThe first statement is 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel'. This is a conditional statement, where the condition is 'the book was written by James' and the consequence is 'the book is a mystery novel'. \n\nThe second statement is 'The book was not written by James'. This is a simple statement that provides information about the book's author.\n\nTo infer 'The book is not a mystery novel', we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. Since the first statement is a conditional, we can use the rule of contrapositive to analyze it. The contrapositive of 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. Applying this rule to the first statement, we get 'If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James'.\n\nNow, we can combine this contrapositive with the second statement 'The book was not written by James'. Since both statements now have the same condition ('the book was not written by James'), we can combine them to get 'If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James' and 'The book was not written by James'. This implies that 'The book is not a mystery novel' is indeed true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
