            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The muffins were not blueberry', we need to analyze the given statements and their logical connections. The first statement 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' is a conditional statement. It implies that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. However, it does not provide any information about the color of the muffins if the cake is not chocolate.\n\nThe second statement 'The cake was not chocolate' is a simple statement that tells us the cake is not chocolate. \n\nTo infer 'The muffins were not blueberry', we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. Since the first statement only provides a condition for when the cake is chocolate, and the second statement tells us the cake is not chocolate, we cannot directly apply the condition to the second statement. Therefore, we cannot conclude the color of the muffins based on the given information.\n\nHowever, we can use the process of elimination to make an inference. If the cake is not chocolate, then the condition 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' does not apply. This means we cannot conclude the muffins are blueberry based on the given information. But, we cannot directly conclude they are not blueberry either, as there is no information about the muffins' color when the cake is not chocolate.\n\nHowever, we can infer that the muffins are not blueberry if we assume that the only two possibilities for the muffins' color are blueberry and another color. If the cake is not chocolate, then the condition for the muffins being blueberry does not apply, and we cannot conclude the muffins are blueberry. Therefore, we can infer that the muffins are not blueberry if we assume there are only two possibilities for the muffins' color.\n\nAnswer: yes",
