            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional statement, which is in the form of 'If A, then B' and 'If B, then A'. This is known as a contrapositive argument. In a contrapositive argument, the truth of the conclusion is dependent on the truth of the premise. \n\nIn this case, the premise is 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta', which can be written as 'Sue chose pizza \u2192 Bob chose pasta'. The conclusion is 'If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza', which can be written as 'Bob chose pasta \u2192 Sue chose pizza'. \n\nThe contrapositive of the premise is 'If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza', which is logically equivalent to the conclusion. Since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
