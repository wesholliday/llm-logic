            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement, where the premise is 'If the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den' (B \u2192 W) and the conclusion is 'If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case' (W \u2192 B). \n\nTo check for validity, we can use a truth table or logical equivalences. However, a simpler approach is to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. The premise states that if the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den. This does not necessarily imply that if the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case. The wolf could be in the den for other reasons, not necessarily because the bear was in the case.\n\nFor example, consider the following scenario: the wolf was in the den because it was a wolf den, and the bear was not in the case. In this case, the premise is true (B \u2192 W), but the conclusion is false (W \u2192 B). This shows that the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
