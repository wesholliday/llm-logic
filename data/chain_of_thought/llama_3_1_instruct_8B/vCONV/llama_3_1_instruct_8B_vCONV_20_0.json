            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional statement, which is in the form of 'If P, then Q' and 'If Q, then P'. This is known as a contrapositive argument. In a contrapositive argument, the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. \n\nHowever, in this case, the argument is not exactly a contrapositive argument because the premise and conclusion are not in the form of 'If not P, then not Q' and 'If not Q, then not P'. The premise is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' and the conclusion is 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red'. \n\nTo check for logical validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. The premise states that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. This does not necessarily mean that if the banana is yellow, then the apple is red. The conclusion is an inverse of the premise, not a contrapositive. \n\nIn a valid argument, the conclusion must logically follow from the premise. In this case, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise because the premise does not provide any information about the relationship between the banana being yellow and the apple being red in both directions. It only provides information about the relationship in one direction.\n\nAnswer: no",
