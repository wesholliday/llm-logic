            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows a valid logical structure. The argument is a conditional statement with two conditional statements. The first conditional statement is 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' and the second conditional statement is 'If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate'. \n\nThe argument is an example of a contrapositive argument. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. The contrapositive of the first statement is 'If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate'. The contrapositive of the second statement is 'If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry'. \n\nThe argument is logically valid because it follows the form of a contrapositive argument, which is a valid form of argument. This means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. \n\nAnswer: yes",
