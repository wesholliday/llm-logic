            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows a valid logical structure. The argument is a conditional statement with two conditional statements. The first premise is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim' and the conclusion is 'If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton'. \n\nTo check for validity, we can try to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. We can do this by using a truth table or by analyzing the argument's structure. However, in this case, we can see that the argument is an example of a contrapositive argument. The contrapositive of the original premise is 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton'. The conclusion is the contrapositive of the original premise, which is 'If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton'. \n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original premise is true, the contrapositive is also true. Since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, it is logically equivalent to the premise and is therefore true if the premise is true. This means that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
