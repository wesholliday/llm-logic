            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional statement, which is of the form 'If A, then B' (A \u2192 B). The given premise is 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' (D \u2192 C), and the conclusion is 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside' (C \u2192 D). \n\nTo check for logical validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, the premise and conclusion are related to each other through a process called 'contrapositive'. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. The contrapositive of the premise 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' is 'If the cat was inside, then the dog was outside', which is the same as the conclusion 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside' when we negate both the premise and the conclusion.\n\nHowever, the contrapositive of the premise is not the same as the conclusion. The contrapositive of the premise is 'If the cat was inside, then the dog was outside', which is not the same as the conclusion 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside'. \n\nHowever, we can see that the conclusion is the inverse of the contrapositive of the premise. The inverse of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If B, then A'. The inverse of the premise 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' is 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside', which is the same as the conclusion.\n\nThe inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement, but it is logically equivalent to the inverse of the contrapositive. However, the argument is still logically valid because it follows the rule of logical equivalence between the inverse of a conditional statement and the inverse of its contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: yes",
