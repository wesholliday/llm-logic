            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the form of the argument and see if it follows a valid logical structure. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement, where the premise is 'If A, then B' and the conclusion is 'If B, then A'. This form is known as a contrapositive form, which is a valid logical structure. In this case, A represents 'Jeff played basketball' and B represents 'Amy played tennis'. The contrapositive form is valid because it essentially states that if the condition B is true, then the condition A must also be true, which is a logical consequence of the original conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
