            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional statement, which can be represented as:\n\nIf P, then Q\n\u2234 If Q, then P\n\nWhere P is 'Sam took a plane' and Q is 'Erin took a train'. \n\nThis form of argument is known as a contrapositive, which is a valid form of argument in logic. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. In this case, the contrapositive would be 'If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane'. However, the given argument is not the contrapositive, but rather the converse of the contrapositive.\n\nThe converse of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If Q, then P'. This form of argument is not necessarily valid, as it does not follow the rules of logical reasoning. However, in this specific case, the argument is actually the converse of the contrapositive, which is a valid form of argument.\n\nThe contrapositive of the given argument 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' is 'If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane'. The converse of this contrapositive is 'If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane', which is the given argument. Therefore, the given argument is actually the converse of the contrapositive, which is a valid form of argument.\n\nAnswer: yes",
