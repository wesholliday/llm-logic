            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if it follows a valid logical structure. The argument is a conditional statement with two conditional statements. The first premise is 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake', and the conclusion is 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake'. \n\nTo check for validity, we can try to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. A valid argument form is one where if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true. \n\nIn this case, the argument is an example of a contrapositive argument. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. The contrapositive of the premise 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake'. \n\nThe conclusion 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake' is the converse of the premise, not the contrapositive. The converse of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If B, then A'. \n\nThe converse of the premise 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake'. However, the converse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.",
