            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the form of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logical inference. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement, where the premise is 'If A, then B' and the conclusion is 'If B, then A'. This form is known as a contrapositive form, which is a valid form of argument in logic.\n\nIn this case, the premise is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', which can be represented as 'If M, then S'. The conclusion is 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding', which can be represented as 'If S, then M'. This is the contrapositive of the premise, which means that if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nSince the argument is in the contrapositive form, it follows the rules of logical inference and is therefore logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
