This statement directly tells us the opposite of what we are trying to infer. The second statement is 'Either the whiffle is shanked or it is tinked'. This is a disjunction, meaning it presents two possibilities: either the whiffle is shanked or it is tinked. \n\nGiven that the first statement says the whiffle is not tinked, we can eliminate the 'tinked' option from the second statement. This leaves us with only one possibility: the whiffle is shanked. \n\nSince we have eliminated the other option and the second statement presents only two possibilities, we can conclude that the whiffle must be shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
