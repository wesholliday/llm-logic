'The fleeg is not surned'\n2. 'Either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned'\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the fleeg is not surned. \n\nStatement 2 is a disjunction, which means it presents two possibilities: either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned. \n\nSince we know from statement 1 that the fleeg is not surned, we can eliminate the second option in the disjunction. \n\nThis leaves us with only one possibility: the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer that 'The fleeg is bluttered' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
