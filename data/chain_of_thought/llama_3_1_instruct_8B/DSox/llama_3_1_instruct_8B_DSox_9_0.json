This statement directly tells us the state of the twonk regarding being plinked. The second statement is 'Either the twonk is varnished or it is plinked'. This is a disjunction, meaning it presents two possibilities: either the twonk is varnished or it is plinked. \n\nGiven that we know the twonk is not plinked from the first statement, we can use the process of elimination to determine if the twonk is varnished. Since the twonk cannot be plinked, the only remaining option from the second statement is that the twonk must be varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
