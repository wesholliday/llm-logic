This means that the document can fulfill either of these conditions, but it does not necessarily mean that it must fulfill both. Therefore, we can infer that the document must have been signed or notarized, but we cannot infer that it must have been notarized specifically, as the statement does not exclude the possibility of the document being signed instead.\n\nAnswer: no",
