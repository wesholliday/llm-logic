            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical inference problem. The given statement 'The package must have been delivered yesterday or the day before' is a disjunction, which means it includes two possibilities: the package was delivered yesterday or the day before. However, the statement does not exclude the possibility that the package was delivered on both days. \n\nTo infer 'The package must have been delivered the day before', we would need to know that the package was not delivered yesterday. But the given statement does not provide this information. It only provides two possibilities, and we cannot rule out the possibility that the package was delivered on both days. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the package must have been delivered the day before.\n\nAnswer: no",
