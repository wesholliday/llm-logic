It implies that the password must be at least eight characters long, but it does not exclude the possibility of the password being exactly eight characters long. Therefore, it is not possible to infer that the password must have been longer than eight characters, as the statement does not rule out the possibility of the password being exactly eight characters long.\n\nAnswer: no",
