            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The project must have been extended', we need to analyze the given statement 'The project must have been completed by Friday or extended'. This statement presents two possibilities: either the project was completed by Friday or it was extended. The word 'or' is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. However, it does not necessarily mean that both conditions are true. \n\nIn this case, if the project was completed by Friday, it does not necessarily mean that it was extended. The statement only provides a condition for the project's completion, not a condition for its extension. Therefore, we cannot infer that the project must have been extended.\n\nAnswer: no",
