            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The application must have been completed in person', we need to analyze the given statement 'The application must have been completed online or in person'. This statement presents two options: 'online' and 'in person'. The use of 'or' indicates that the application can be completed in one of these two ways, but not necessarily both. The statement does not exclude the possibility of the application being completed in person, but it also does not imply that it must be completed in person. It simply provides two alternatives. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The application must have been completed in person' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
