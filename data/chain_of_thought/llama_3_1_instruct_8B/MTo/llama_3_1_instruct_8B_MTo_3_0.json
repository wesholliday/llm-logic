            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The book was not written by James', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'The book is not a mystery novel', which provides us with information about the book's genre. The second statement is 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel', which gives us a condition about James and the book's genre. \n\nWe can use a logical approach called modus tollens to analyze this situation. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: if P implies Q, and not Q, then not P. In this case, P is 'The book was written by James' and Q is 'The book is a mystery novel'. \n\nGiven that we know 'The book is not a mystery novel' (not Q), we can use modus tollens to conclude that 'The book was not written by James' (not P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
