            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Joe did not go to the park', we need to analyze the given statements and their logical implications. The first statement is 'Lucy did not go to the zoo'. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'. This means that if the condition (Joe went to the park) is true, then the consequence (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true.\n\nHowever, we are given that Lucy did not go to the zoo. This directly contradicts the consequence of the conditional statement. Therefore, we can conclude that the condition (Joe went to the park) must be false, because if it were true, the consequence (Lucy went to the zoo) would also be true, which is not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
