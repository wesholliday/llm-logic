            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The apple was not red' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements and apply the rules of logical inference.\n\nThe first statement is 'The banana was not yellow'. This statement directly tells us the color of the banana, which is not yellow.\n\nThe second statement is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the apple being red) is true, then the consequent (the banana being yellow) must also be true.\n\nNow, we are given that the banana was not yellow. We can use this information to infer that the antecedent of the conditional statement (the apple being red) must be false. This is because if the antecedent were true, the consequent (the banana being yellow) would also be true, but we know that the banana is not yellow.\n\nTherefore, since the consequent (the banana being yellow) is false, the antecedent (the apple being red) must also be false. This means that we can infer that 'The apple was not red'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
