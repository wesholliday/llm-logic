            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Mary was not at the wedding', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Sue was not at the wedding' provides direct information about Sue's attendance at the wedding. The second statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement that implies a relationship between Mary's and Sue's attendance. \n\nTo infer 'Mary was not at the wedding', we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. Since the second statement is a conditional statement, we can use the process of modus tollens to analyze it. Modus tollens is a logical rule that states: if P implies Q, and not Q, then not P.\n\nIn this case, P is 'Mary was at the wedding', and Q is 'Sue was at the wedding'. The first statement 'Sue was not at the wedding' is equivalent to 'not Q'. \n\nUsing modus tollens, we can conclude that if 'not Q' (Sue was not at the wedding) and 'P implies Q' (If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding), then 'not P' (Mary was not at the wedding).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can logically infer that 'Mary was not at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
