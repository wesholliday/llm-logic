            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The cake was not chocolate', we need to analyze the given statements and their logical implications. \n\nFirst, we have 'The muffins were not blueberry'. This statement directly tells us the color of the muffins, but it doesn't provide any information about the cake.\n\nThe second statement is 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry'. This is a conditional statement that links the color of the cake to the color of the muffins. It implies that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. However, it does not provide any information about the color of the cake when the muffins are not blueberry.\n\nNow, let's combine the two statements. We know the muffins are not blueberry, and if the cake were chocolate, the muffins would be blueberry. Since the muffins are not blueberry, it means the cake cannot be chocolate, because if it were, the muffins would have to be blueberry, which contradicts the given information.\n\nTherefore, we can logically conclude that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
