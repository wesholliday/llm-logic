            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Sue did not choose pizza', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Bob did not choose pasta' provides information about Bob's choice but does not directly relate to Sue's choice. The second statement 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta' is a conditional statement that links Sue's choice of pizza to Bob's choice of pasta. \n\nTo infer 'Sue did not choose pizza', we need to find a contradiction or a logical conclusion from the given statements. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta, but we know Bob did not choose pasta. This directly contradicts the second statement, which implies that if Sue chose pizza, Bob would have chosen pasta. Therefore, we can conclude that Sue did not choose pizza because if she had, it would lead to a contradiction with the information that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
