            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt' provides information about Mark's action, but it doesn't directly relate to Lisa's action. The second statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement that links Lisa's action (buying the red shirt) to Mark's action (buying the blue shirt). \n\nTo infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt', we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt, but we know Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This creates a contradiction, suggesting that the initial condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is unlikely to be true. Therefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
