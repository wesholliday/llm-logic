            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The doll was not plastic', we need to analyze the given statements and their logical connections. \n\nFirst, we have 'The truck was not metal'. This statement directly tells us the composition of the truck, which is not metal.\n\nThe second statement is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'. This is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (the doll being plastic) is true, then the consequence (the truck being metal) must also be true. However, this statement does not directly tell us the composition of the doll or the truck.\n\nTo infer 'The doll was not plastic', we need to combine the two statements. If the truck was not metal (from the first statement), and if the doll being plastic would make the truck metal (from the second statement), then it implies that the doll cannot be plastic, because if it were, the truck would be metal, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can logically conclude that 'The doll was not plastic'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
