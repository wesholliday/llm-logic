            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Tom did not watch football', we need to analyze the given statements and their logical implications. The first statement is 'Jen did not watch basketball'. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'. This means that if Tom watched football, it is a necessary condition for Jen to watch basketball. \n\nHowever, we are given that Jen did not watch basketball. This directly contradicts the condition in the second statement, which implies that if Tom watched football, Jen would watch basketball. Therefore, we can conclude that Tom did not watch football, because if he had watched football, Jen would have watched basketball, but she did not.\n\nAnswer: yes",
