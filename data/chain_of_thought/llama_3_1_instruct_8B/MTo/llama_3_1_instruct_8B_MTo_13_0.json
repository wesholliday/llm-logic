            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The car was not red', we need to analyze the given statements and their logical implications. \n\nFirst, we have 'The truck was not blue'. This statement directly contradicts the conclusion of the second statement, which is 'The truck was blue'. \n\nThe second statement is 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the car being red) is true, then the consequence (the truck being blue) follows. However, it does not imply that the truck is blue if the car is not red. \n\nGiven that we know 'The truck was not blue', we can conclude that the condition of the second statement (the car being red) must be false, because if it were true, the consequence (the truck being blue) would also be true, which contradicts the given information. \n\nTherefore, since the condition of the second statement is false, we can infer that 'The car was not red'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
