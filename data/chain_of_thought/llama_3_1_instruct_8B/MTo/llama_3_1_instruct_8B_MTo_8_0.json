            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The vampire was not awake', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'The mummy was not awake'. This statement directly tells us the state of the mummy. The second statement is 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake'. This is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (the vampire was awake) is not met, we cannot conclude anything about the mummy's state. However, if we combine these two statements, we can use a process called modus tollens, which is a form of argument in logic. Modus tollens states that if 'if A then B' and 'not B', then 'not A'. In this case, 'A' is 'the vampire was awake' and 'B' is 'the mummy was awake'. Since we know 'the mummy was not awake' (not B), we can conclude that 'the vampire was not awake' (not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
