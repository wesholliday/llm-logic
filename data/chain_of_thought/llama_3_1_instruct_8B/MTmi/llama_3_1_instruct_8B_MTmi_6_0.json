            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Sue did not choose pizza', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta' is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (Sue chose pizza) is true, then the consequence (Bob must have chosen pasta) must also be true. However, the second statement 'Bob might not have chosen pasta' indicates that it's possible for Bob not to have chosen pasta. \n\nGiven that Bob might not have chosen pasta, it doesn't necessarily mean that Sue chose pizza. The possibility of Bob not choosing pasta doesn't directly relate to Sue's choice. However, if we combine the two statements, we can see that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta, but since Bob might not have chosen pasta, it's possible that Sue didn't choose pizza. This is because if Bob didn't choose pasta, it contradicts the condition that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
