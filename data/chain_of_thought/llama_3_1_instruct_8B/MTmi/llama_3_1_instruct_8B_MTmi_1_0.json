            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Mary was not at the wedding', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding' is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue must have been at the wedding) is also true. However, this does not imply that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nThe second statement 'Sue might not have been at the wedding' is a statement of possibility, indicating that there is a chance Sue was not at the wedding. \n\nTo infer 'Mary was not at the wedding', we would need to know that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding. However, the given statements do not provide this information. The first statement only tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding, but it does not tell us the opposite.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Mary was not at the wedding' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
