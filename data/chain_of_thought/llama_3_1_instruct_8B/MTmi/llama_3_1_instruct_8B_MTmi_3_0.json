            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The book was not written by James', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel' is a conditional statement. It implies that if the book was written by James, it must be a mystery novel. The second statement 'The book might not be a mystery novel' suggests that there is a possibility that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nTo infer 'The book was not written by James', we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. If the book is not a mystery novel, it does not necessarily mean it was not written by James. However, if we combine the two statements, we can see that if the book is not a mystery novel, it could be written by someone else. But the statements do not provide any information about the book not being written by James directly.\n\nHowever, we can use a logical process called modus tollens to analyze this. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: if P implies Q, and not Q, then not P. In this case, P is 'The book was written by James', and Q is 'The book must be a mystery novel'. The second statement 'The book might not be a mystery novel' can be interpreted as 'not Q'. \n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer that if the book might not be a mystery novel (not Q), then it is possible that the book was not written by James (not P). However, this is not a definitive conclusion, as there could be other possibilities. But we can say that it is possible to infer 'The book was not written by James' based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
