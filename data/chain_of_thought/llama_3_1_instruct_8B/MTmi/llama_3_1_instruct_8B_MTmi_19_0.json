            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Tom did not watch football', we need to analyze the given statements and their logical implications. \n\nThe first statement is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequence (Jen must have watched basketball) must also be true. However, this does not provide any information about what happens if Tom did not watch football.\n\nThe second statement is 'Jen might not have watched basketball'. This statement introduces uncertainty about Jen's actions, but it does not provide any direct information about Tom's actions.\n\nTo infer 'Tom did not watch football', we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. Since the first statement only provides a condition for Jen's action (watching basketball) based on Tom's action (watching football), and the second statement introduces uncertainty about Jen's action, we cannot directly infer Tom's action from these statements.\n\nHowever, we can use a process of elimination. If Jen might not have watched basketball, and the only reason for Jen to watch basketball is if Tom watched football, then it is possible that Tom did not watch football. This is because if Tom did not watch football, there would be no reason for Jen to watch basketball, and the statement 'Jen might not have watched basketball' would be consistent with this scenario.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that Tom did not watch football, but only under the assumption that the only reason for Jen to watch basketball is if Tom watched football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
