            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The doll was not plastic', we need to analyze the given statements and their logical connections. \n\nThe first statement is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal'. This is a conditional statement where the condition is 'the doll was plastic' and the consequence is 'the truck must have been metal'. \n\nThe second statement is 'The truck might not have been metal'. This statement introduces uncertainty about the material of the truck.\n\nTo infer 'The doll was not plastic', we need to find a logical connection between the given statements and the conclusion. \n\nIf the truck might not have been metal, it means there's a possibility that the truck is not metal. However, the first statement only tells us that if the doll is plastic, the truck must be metal. It doesn't provide any information about the truck's material if the doll is not plastic.\n\nSince we don't have any information about the doll's material from the second statement, we can't directly infer the doll's material from the given statements. However, we can use the first statement to infer that if the doll is plastic, the truck must be metal. But since the second statement introduces uncertainty about the truck's material, we can't be certain about the doll's material.\n\nHowever, we can use the process of elimination to infer that the doll might not be plastic. If the truck might not be metal, and if the doll being plastic would make the truck metal, then the doll might not be plastic because the truck's material is uncertain.\n\nAnswer: yes",
