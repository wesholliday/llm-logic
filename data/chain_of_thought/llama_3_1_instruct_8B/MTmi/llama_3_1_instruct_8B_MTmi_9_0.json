            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt'. This means that if the condition (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, the consequence (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true. However, the second statement is a possibility: 'Mark might not have bought the blue shirt'. This statement does not provide any information about Lisa's action.\n\nTo infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt', we need to find a contradiction or a logical inconsistency between the given statements. If Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, it does not necessarily mean that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. The two statements do not provide a direct contradiction or a logical inconsistency that would lead to the conclusion that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nHowever, we can use a process of elimination to analyze the situation. If Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, it means that the condition in the first statement (Lisa bought the red shirt) might not lead to the consequence (Mark bought the blue shirt). This does not necessarily mean that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, but it does create a possibility where Lisa bought the red shirt and Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt', we need to consider the possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, it does not provide any information about Lisa's action. However, if we combine this with the first statement, we can see that if Lisa bought the red shirt, Mark would have to buy the blue shirt. But since Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, it creates a possibility where Lisa bought the red shirt and Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nHowever, we can also consider the possibility that Mark did buy the blue shirt. If Mark bought the blue shirt, it would mean that Lisa must have bought the red shirt (based on the first statement). But this would contradict the statement that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. This creates a logical inconsistency, and we can use this inconsistency to infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
