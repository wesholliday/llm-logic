            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The meeting must have been at 2 PM', we need to analyze the given statement 'The meeting must have been at 2 PM or cancelled'. This statement presents two possibilities: the meeting was at 2 PM or it was cancelled. The word 'or' is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the options must be true. However, the statement does not provide any information that would lead us to conclude that the meeting was definitely at 2 PM. It only provides two possible scenarios, and we cannot rule out the possibility that the meeting was cancelled. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The meeting must have been at 2 PM' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
