            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical inference, where we need to determine if one statement can be deduced from another. The original statement is a compound statement that includes two options: 'online' and 'in person'. The question asks if we can infer that the application must have been completed online, which means we need to see if the original statement implies that online is the only option.\n\nThe original statement says 'or', which is a disjunction. In logic, 'or' is a disjunction that means at least one of the options is true. This means that the application could have been completed either online or in person, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it must have been completed online.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the application must have been completed online from the original statement. The original statement leaves open the possibility that the application could have been completed in person.\n\nAnswer: no",
