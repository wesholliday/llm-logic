            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The event must have been formal' from 'The event must have been formal or semi-formal', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. The word 'or' is a disjunctive conjunction, which means it indicates a choice between two options. In this case, the two options are 'formal' and 'semi-formal'. Since 'semi-formal' is a subset of 'formal' (a semi-formal event is a type of formal event), we can say that 'The event must have been formal' is a subset of 'The event must have been formal or semi-formal'. This means that if the event is formal or semi-formal, it must also be formal. Therefore, we can logically infer that 'The event must have been formal' from 'The event must have been formal or semi-formal'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
