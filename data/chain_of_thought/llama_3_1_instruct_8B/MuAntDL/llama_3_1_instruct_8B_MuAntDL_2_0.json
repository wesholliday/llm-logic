The word 'or' is a logical operator that indicates an exclusive disjunction, meaning that the statement is true if either of the two conditions is met. In this case, the two conditions are 'The book must have been on the shelf' and 'The book must have been in the library'. \n\nSince the statement does not provide any information that would suggest the book was in the library, we can only be certain that the book was on the shelf if we assume the book was not in the library. However, the statement does not provide any information that would allow us to rule out the possibility that the book was in the library. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the book must have been on the shelf.\n\nHowever, we can infer that the book was either on the shelf or in the library, but we cannot infer that it must have been on the shelf specifically.",
