            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The restaurant must have been closed on Monday', we need to analyze the given statement. The statement 'The restaurant must have been closed on Monday or open for limited hours' is a disjunctive statement, which means it presents two possible scenarios: either the restaurant was closed on Monday or it was open for limited hours. This statement does not provide any information about the restaurant's status on other days of the week. It only provides information about Monday. Since we are trying to infer the restaurant's status on Monday, we can indeed make a conclusion about it based on the given statement. The statement directly mentions Monday, so we can infer that the restaurant must have been closed on Monday because it is one of the two options presented in the statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
