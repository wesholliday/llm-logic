            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The keys must have been in the drawer', we need to analyze the given statement 'The keys must have been in the drawer or on the table'. This statement presents two possible locations for the keys: the drawer and the table. The use of 'or' indicates that these are the only two possible locations, and the statement implies that the keys are definitely in one of these locations. However, it does not provide any information about the keys being in the drawer specifically. It only provides a choice between the two locations. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the keys must have been in the drawer without ruling out the possibility of them being on the table.\n\nAnswer: no",
