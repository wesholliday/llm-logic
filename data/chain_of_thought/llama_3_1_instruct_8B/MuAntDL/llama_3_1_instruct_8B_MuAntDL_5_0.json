            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical inference problem. The given statement is a disjunction, which means it includes two possibilities: the package was delivered yesterday or the day before. However, the question asks us to infer a specific possibility, which is that the package must have been delivered yesterday. To make this inference, we would need to know that the day before yesterday is not a valid option, or that the package cannot have been delivered on the day before yesterday. However, the given statement does not provide any information about the validity of the day before yesterday as an option. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the package must have been delivered yesterday.\n\nAnswer: no",
