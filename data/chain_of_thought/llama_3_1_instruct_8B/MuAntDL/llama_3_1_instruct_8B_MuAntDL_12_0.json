            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The project must have been completed by Friday' from 'The project must have been completed by Friday or extended', we need to analyze the meaning of the word 'or'. In this context, 'or' is used to indicate an alternative, which means that if the project was not completed by Friday, it would have been extended. However, the statement does not provide any information about the project's status if it was extended. It only provides a condition for when the project was not completed by Friday. Therefore, we cannot infer that the project must have been completed by Friday, as it could have been extended instead.\n\nAnswer: no",
