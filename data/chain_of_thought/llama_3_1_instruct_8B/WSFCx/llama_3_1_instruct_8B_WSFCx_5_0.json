This is an 'or' statement, which means that only one of the outcomes is necessary for the statement to be true. It does not imply that both outcomes can happen simultaneously. In other words, the statement does not suggest that the quazzle can both fizzle frozz and flonk glorp at the same time.\n\nAnswer: no",
