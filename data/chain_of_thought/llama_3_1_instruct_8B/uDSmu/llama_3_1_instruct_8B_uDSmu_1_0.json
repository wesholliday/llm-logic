            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that Fido is inside, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" can be rewritten as a disjunction: Fido is inside \u2228 Fido is in the garden. This statement is true if at least one of the conditions is met. The second statement \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\" can be rewritten as \u00ac(Fido is in the garden). This statement is true if Fido is not in the garden.\n\nSince the second statement is true, we know that Fido is not in the garden. However, the first statement does not guarantee that Fido is inside. It only guarantees that Fido is either inside or in the garden, but we already know that Fido is not in the garden. Therefore, we can conclude that Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
