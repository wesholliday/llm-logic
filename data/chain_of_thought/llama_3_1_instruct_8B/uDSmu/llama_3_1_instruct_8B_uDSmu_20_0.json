The first statement says that either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head. This is a disjunction, meaning it's one or the other, but not both. The second statement says it's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head. This is a negation of the second part of the disjunction. \n\nSince the second part of the disjunction is negated, we can conclude that the first part of the disjunction must be true. This means that the sunglasses are indeed in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
