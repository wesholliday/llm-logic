The first statement says that either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table. This is a disjunction, which means it's one or the other, but not both. The second statement says that it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table. This is a negation of the second part of the disjunction, which means the book is not necessarily on the table.\n\nGiven that the book is not necessarily on the table, we can infer that it must be on the shelf, as the disjunction states that it's either on the shelf or on the table. If it's not on the table, then it must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
