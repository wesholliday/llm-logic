The toy is either in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n2. It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\n\nFrom the second statement, we can infer that the toy does not have to be on the bookshelf. This means it's possible for the toy to be in the toy box. However, we cannot be certain that it is in the toy box because the first statement only provides two possible locations for the toy (the toy box or the bookshelf), but it does not exclude the possibility of the toy being in some other location.\n\nHowever, since the toy must be in one of the two locations mentioned, and we know it's not on the bookshelf, we can conclude that it must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
