            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to apply the rules of logical reasoning, specifically the rules of disjunction and negation. The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" can be translated into a logical expression as: (A \u2228 B), where A is \"the remote control is on the coffee table\" and B is \"the remote control is hiding under the couch\". The second statement \"it's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" can be translated into a logical expression as \u00acB, where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\nWe can then use the rules of logical reasoning to analyze the situation. The statement (A \u2228 B) implies that either A or B (or both) must be true. However, we also know that B is not necessarily true (\u00acB). This means that the only possibility left is that A must be true, since if A were false, then B would have to be true, which contradicts the fact that B is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the remote control must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
