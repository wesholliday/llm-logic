            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional statement with two premises and a conclusion. The first premise is 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside', which is a conditional statement of the form 'If P, then Q'. The second premise is 'The dog was inside', which is a simple statement that asserts the truth of P. The conclusion is 'The cat was outside', which asserts the truth of Q.\n\nTo check for logical validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the first premise establishes a relationship between the dog's location and the cat's location, stating that if the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside. The second premise asserts that the dog is indeed inside. Therefore, according to the first premise, the cat must be outside, as the condition for the cat being outside (the dog being inside) is met.\n\nThis argument follows the modus ponens form, which is a valid form of argument. Modus ponens is a rule of inference that states: If P, then Q; P; therefore, Q. In this case, P is 'The dog was inside', and Q is 'The cat was outside'. Since the argument follows the modus ponens form, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
