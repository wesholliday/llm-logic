            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement (if-then statement) followed by the antecedent (the condition) of the conditional statement. The argument is: \n\n1. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n2. Jeff played basketball.\n3. Therefore, Amy played tennis.\n\nThis form is known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument. In modus ponens, the conclusion logically follows from the premises because the truth of the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) and the conditional statement (if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis) guarantee the truth of the conclusion (Amy played tennis). \n\nAnswer: yes",
