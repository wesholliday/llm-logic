            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a categorical syllogism with two premises and a conclusion. The first premise is 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue', which is a conditional statement. The second premise is 'The car was red', which is a simple statement. The conclusion is 'The truck was blue', which is also a simple statement.\n\nTo evaluate the argument's validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the first premise establishes a conditional relationship between the car's color and the truck's color. The second premise states that the car is red, which triggers the conditional statement in the first premise. Therefore, according to the first premise, if the car is red, then the truck must be blue.\n\nThe conclusion 'The truck was blue' directly follows from the first premise and the second premise. Since the first premise establishes a conditional relationship and the second premise satisfies the condition, the conclusion logically follows. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
