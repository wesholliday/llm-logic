            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a simple conditional argument with two premises and a conclusion. The first premise is 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake', which is a conditional statement. The second premise is 'The vampire was awake', which is a simple statement. The conclusion is 'The mummy was awake', which is also a simple statement.\n\nTo evaluate the argument's validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the first premise establishes a conditional relationship between the vampire's and the mummy's states of being awake. The second premise states that the vampire was awake, which triggers the conditional statement in the first premise. Therefore, according to the rules of logic, if the antecedent (the vampire was awake) is true, then the consequent (the mummy was awake) must also be true.\n\nGiven that the first premise establishes a direct causal relationship between the two states, and the second premise confirms the truth of the antecedent, the conclusion logically follows from the premises. This is an example of a modus ponens argument, a valid form of logical reasoning.\n\nAnswer: yes",
