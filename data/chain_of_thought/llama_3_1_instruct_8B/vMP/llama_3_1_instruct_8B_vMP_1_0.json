            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a simple conditional statement with a premise and a conclusion. The first premise is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', which is a conditional statement. The second premise is 'Mary was at the wedding', which is a simple statement. The conclusion is 'Sue was at the wedding', which is also a simple statement.\n\nTo check for validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the first premise is a conditional statement that links Mary's presence at the wedding to Sue's presence. The second premise states that Mary was indeed at the wedding. Since the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is met, the conclusion (Sue was at the wedding) logically follows from the first premise.\n\nThis argument is an example of modus ponens, a valid form of argument in logic. Modus ponens is a rule of inference that states: if P \u2192 Q and P, then Q. In this case, P is 'Mary was at the wedding' and Q is 'Sue was at the wedding'. Since the premises fit the modus ponens pattern, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
