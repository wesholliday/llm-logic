            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a categorical syllogism with two premises and a conclusion. The first premise is 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad', which is a conditional statement. The second premise is 'Ben ate pasta', which is a simple statement. The conclusion is 'Kate ate salad', which is also a simple statement.\n\nTo check for validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the first premise establishes a relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating salad. The second premise states that Ben ate pasta, which matches the condition in the first premise. Therefore, according to the first premise, if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. Since we know Ben ate pasta, it logically follows that Kate must have eaten salad.\n\nThe argument follows the modus ponens form, which is a valid form of argument. Modus ponens is a rule of inference that states: if P \u2192 Q and P, then Q. In this case, P is 'Ben ate pasta' and Q is 'Kate ate salad'. Since the argument follows the modus ponens form, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
