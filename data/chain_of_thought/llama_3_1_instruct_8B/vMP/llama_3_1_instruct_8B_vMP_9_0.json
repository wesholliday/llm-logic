            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional statement with two premises and a conclusion. The first premise is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt', which is a conditional statement (if-then statement). The second premise is 'Lisa bought the red shirt', which is a simple statement. The conclusion is 'Mark bought the blue shirt', which is also a simple statement.\n\nTo evaluate the argument's validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the first premise is a conditional statement that links the action of Lisa buying the red shirt to Mark buying the blue shirt. The second premise states that Lisa bought the red shirt, which is the condition in the conditional statement. Therefore, according to the rules of logical reasoning, if the condition (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the conclusion (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true, as it is the consequence of the condition.\n\nThis type of argument is known as modus ponens, a valid form of logical reasoning. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
