            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a categorical syllogism, which is a type of deductive argument. \n\nThe first premise is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'. This is a conditional statement, where the 'if-then' relationship is established between two statements. The second premise is 'The shirt was cotton', which is a simple statement. \n\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The conclusion is 'The pants were denim'. \n\nIn a categorical syllogism, the conclusion must follow from the premises through a logical rule of inference. In this case, the first premise establishes a conditional relationship between the shirt being cotton and the pants being denim. The second premise states that the shirt is indeed cotton. Therefore, according to the first premise, if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. This is a direct application of the first premise to the second premise, which leads to the conclusion that the pants are denim.\n\nThe argument follows the form of a categorical syllogism, where the conclusion is logically derived from the premises through a valid rule of inference. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
