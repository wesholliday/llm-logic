            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a classic example of a categorical syllogism, which is a type of deductive argument. \n\nThe argument can be represented in a more formal way as follows:\n\n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow (If P, then Q)\n2. The apple was red (P)\n3. Therefore, the banana was yellow (Q)\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the first premise states a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true. The second premise states that the antecedent (P) is true, which means that the consequent (Q) must also be true according to the first premise.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
