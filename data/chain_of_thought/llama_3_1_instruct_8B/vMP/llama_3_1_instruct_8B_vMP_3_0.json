            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is in the form of a syllogism, with two premises and a conclusion. The first premise is 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel', which is a conditional statement. The second premise is 'The book was written by James', which is a statement that asserts the antecedent of the conditional statement in the first premise. The conclusion is 'The book is a mystery novel', which is the consequent of the conditional statement in the first premise.\n\nIn a valid argument, the conclusion must follow logically from the premises. In this case, the second premise asserts that the book was written by James, which is the condition stated in the first premise. Therefore, if the first premise is true, the conclusion must also be true, as the condition (the book being written by James) is met. This is an example of modus ponens, a valid form of logical reasoning.\n\nAnswer: yes",
