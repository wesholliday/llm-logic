            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement, where the first premise is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' (p \u2192 q), the second premise is 'The doll was plastic' (p), and the conclusion is 'The truck was metal' (q). \n\nIn a valid argument, the conclusion must follow logically from the premises. In this case, if the first premise states that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal, and we know the doll is plastic, then it logically follows that the truck is metal. This is because the first premise establishes a direct relationship between the two statements, and the second premise provides the necessary condition to make the conclusion true.\n\nThe argument follows the modus ponens rule of inference, which states that if p \u2192 q and p, then q. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
