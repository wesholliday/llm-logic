            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that the car was not red, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement says \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the car being red) is true, then the consequence (the truck being blue) must also be true. However, the second statement says \"the truck was not blue.\" This is a direct statement that contradicts the consequence of the first statement.\n\nSince the truck was not blue, we can conclude that the condition of the first statement (the car being red) must be false. This is because if the condition were true, the consequence (the truck being blue) would also be true, but we know that the consequence is false (the truck is not blue). Therefore, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
