            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the consequence (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true. However, the second statement \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" contradicts the consequence of the first statement. \n\nSince the consequence of the first statement is not true (Mark did not buy the blue shirt), we cannot conclude that the condition of the first statement is true (Lisa bought the red shirt). This is because the condition and consequence are linked by an \"if-then\" statement, and if the consequence is false, it does not necessarily mean the condition is false, but it does mean we cannot be certain the condition is true.\n\nHowever, we can conclude that we cannot be certain Lisa bought the red shirt because the condition of the first statement is not necessarily true. But we cannot directly infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt from the given information. The statements do not provide enough information to conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
