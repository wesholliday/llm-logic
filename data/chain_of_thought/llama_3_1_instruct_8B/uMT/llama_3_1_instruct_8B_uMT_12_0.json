            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that Joe did not go to the park, we need to analyze the given information. The first statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (Joe went to the park) is true, then the consequence (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true. However, the second statement \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\" contradicts the consequence of the first statement. This means that the condition (Joe went to the park) must be false, because if it were true, the consequence (Lucy went to the zoo) would also be true, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
