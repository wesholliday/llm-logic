            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue was at the wedding) is also true. However, the second statement \"Sue was not at the wedding\" directly contradicts the consequence of the first statement. \n\nSince the second statement directly contradicts the consequence of the first statement, we can conclude that the condition of the first statement (Mary was at the wedding) must be false. This is because if the condition were true, the consequence would also be true, but we know the consequence (Sue was at the wedding) is false. Therefore, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
