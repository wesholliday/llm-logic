            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the consequence (Amy playing tennis) must also be true. However, the second statement \"Amy did not play tennis\" contradicts the consequence of the first statement. This means that the condition (Jeff playing basketball) cannot be true because if it were, the consequence (Amy playing tennis) would also be true, but we know that Amy did not play tennis. Therefore, we can conclude that the condition (Jeff playing basketball) must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
