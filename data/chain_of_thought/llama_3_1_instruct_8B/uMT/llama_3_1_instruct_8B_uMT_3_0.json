            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that the book was not written by James, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement says that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. This is a conditional statement, where the condition is \"the book was written by James\" and the consequence is \"the book is a mystery novel.\" The second statement says that the book is not a mystery novel. \n\nWe can use a logical approach called \"modus tollens\" to analyze this situation. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: if A implies B, and B is false, then A must be false. In this case, A is \"the book was written by James\" and B is \"the book is a mystery novel.\" Since we know that B (the book is a mystery novel) is false, we can conclude that A (the book was written by James) must also be false.\n\nHowever, we need to be careful because the first statement is not a direct implication, but rather a conditional statement. The correct interpretation of the first statement is: \"If the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel\" is equivalent to \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then it was not written by James.\" This is because the conditional statement is in the form \"if-then,\" and we can invert the condition and the consequence to get the contrapositive.\n\nUsing the contrapositive, we can apply modus tollens: if the book is not a mystery novel, then it was not written by James. Since we know that the book is not a mystery novel, we can conclude that it was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
