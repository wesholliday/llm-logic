            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that Tom did not watch football, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequence (Jen watched basketball) must also be true. However, the second statement \"Jen did not watch basketball\" contradicts the consequence of the first statement. This means that the condition (Tom watched football) must be false, because if it were true, the consequence (Jen watched basketball) would also be true, which is not the case. Therefore, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
