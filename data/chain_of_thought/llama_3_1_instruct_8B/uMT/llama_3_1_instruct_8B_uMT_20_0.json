            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that the apple was not red, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement says \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the consequence (the banana being yellow) is also true. However, the second statement says \"the banana was not yellow.\" This statement directly contradicts the consequence of the first statement.\n\nSince the banana was not yellow, we can conclude that the condition in the first statement (the apple being red) must be false. This is because the consequence (the banana being yellow) did not occur, which means the condition that led to it must not have been true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
