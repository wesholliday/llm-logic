            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that the doll was not plastic, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement says that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This is a conditional statement, which means that it only provides information about the relationship between the doll and the truck under the condition that the doll is plastic. It does not provide any information about the material of the doll itself.\n\nThe second statement says that the truck was not metal. This statement provides information about the material of the truck, but it does not provide any information about the material of the doll.\n\nSince the first statement only provides information about the relationship between the doll and the truck under the condition that the doll is plastic, and the second statement only provides information about the truck, we cannot directly infer the material of the doll from the given statements. We cannot conclude that the doll was not plastic based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
