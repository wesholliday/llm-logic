            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that the vampire was not awake, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement says that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. This is a conditional statement, which means that the presence of the vampire being awake is a sufficient condition for the mummy to be awake. The second statement says that the mummy was not awake. \n\nUsing the first statement, we can deduce that if the mummy was not awake, it does not necessarily mean the vampire was not awake. However, since we know the mummy was not awake, we can use the first statement to infer that the vampire must also not be awake. This is because the first statement implies that the mummy's wakefulness is dependent on the vampire's wakefulness. If the mummy is not awake, it could be because the vampire is not awake, as the condition for the mummy's wakefulness is not met.\n\nAnswer: yes",
