            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that the shirt was not cotton, we need to analyze the given information. The first statement says that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. This is a conditional statement, which means that it only provides a relationship between the two items when the shirt is cotton. It does not provide any information about the material of the shirt when the pants are not denim.\n\nThe second statement says that the pants were not denim. This statement is independent of the first statement and does not provide any information about the material of the shirt.\n\nSince the first statement only provides a relationship between the shirt and pants when the shirt is cotton, and the second statement does not provide any information about the shirt, we cannot infer that the shirt was not cotton based on the given information. The shirt could still be cotton, and the pants could be made of a different material.\n\nAnswer: no",
