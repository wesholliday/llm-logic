            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The fribble was not snurgled', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked' is a conditional statement. It implies that if the condition (the fribble was snurgled) is true, then the consequence (the fribble crinked) must also be true. The second statement 'The fribble did not crink' is a fact that contradicts the consequence of the first statement. \n\nGiven that the consequence of the first statement is not true (the fribble did not crink), we can infer that the condition of the first statement must also be false. This is because if the condition were true, the consequence would also be true, but since the consequence is not true, the condition must be false. Therefore, we can conclude that 'The fribble was not snurgled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
