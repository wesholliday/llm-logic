            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The sneg was not crampled', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink'. This is a conditional statement, where the condition is 'the sneg was crampled' and the consequence is 'the sneg sproted the frink'. The second statement is 'The sneg did not sproted the frink'. \n\nWe can use the process of elimination and contradiction to analyze this. If the sneg did not sproted the frink, and the consequence of the sneg being crampled is that it sproted the frink, then it is possible that the sneg was not crampled. This is because if the sneg was crampled, it should have sproted the frink, but it didn't, so it's likely that it wasn't crampled in the first place.\n\nHowever, we cannot be 100% certain that the sneg was not crampled because there could be other reasons why the sneg didn't sproted the frink. But given the information we have, it's a reasonable conclusion to make.\n\nAnswer: yes",
