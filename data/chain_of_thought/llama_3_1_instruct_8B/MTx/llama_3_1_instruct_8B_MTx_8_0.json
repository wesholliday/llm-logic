            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The sprocket was not cranked', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled' is a conditional statement. It implies that if the sprocket was cranked, it must have been daggled. The second statement 'The sprocket was not daggled' directly contradicts the conclusion of the first statement. \n\nSince the sprocket was not daggled, it means the condition for the first statement (the sprocket being cranked) must not have been met. This is because if the sprocket was cranked, it would have been daggled according to the first statement, but it wasn't. Therefore, we can logically conclude that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
