            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The splat was not morphed', we need to analyze the given statements and their logical implications. \n\nThe first statement is 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked'. This is a conditional statement, where 'if-then' relationship is established between 'the splat was morphed' and 'the splat quanked'. \n\nThe second statement is 'The splat did not quank'. \n\nTo infer 'The splat was not morphed', we need to establish a logical connection between the two statements. \n\nIf the splat did not quank, it implies that the condition for the splat to quank (i.e., the splat being morphed) is not met. This is because the conditional statement 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked' suggests that morphing is a necessary condition for quanking. \n\nTherefore, if the splat did not quank, it is reasonable to conclude that the splat was not morphed, as the condition for quanking (morphing) is not met.\n\nAnswer: yes",
