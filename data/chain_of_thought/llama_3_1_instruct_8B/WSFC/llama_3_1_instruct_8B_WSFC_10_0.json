The word 'or' is used to indicate that the movie can be either a comedy or a drama, but not both at the same time. This is an exclusive 'or', where the two options are not inclusive of each other. Therefore, we cannot infer that the movie might be both a comedy and a drama from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
