The word 'grazzle' is a possible state or condition of 'flonk'. The statement does not provide any information about 'frazzle' being a possible state or condition of 'flonk'. It only mentions 'grazzle'. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'frazzle' is a possible state or condition of 'flonk' based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
