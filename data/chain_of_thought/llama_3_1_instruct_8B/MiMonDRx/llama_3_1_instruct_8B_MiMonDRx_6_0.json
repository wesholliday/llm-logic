The original statement is a conditional statement where 'The blimple might be wibble' implies that there is a possibility that 'The blimple' could be 'wibble'. However, this statement does not provide any information about other possibilities. It only specifies one possible outcome. \n\nIn order to infer 'The blimple might be froodle or wibble', we would need additional information that suggests 'froodle' is also a possible outcome. Since the original statement does not provide any information about 'froodle', we cannot infer that 'The blimple might be froodle or wibble' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
