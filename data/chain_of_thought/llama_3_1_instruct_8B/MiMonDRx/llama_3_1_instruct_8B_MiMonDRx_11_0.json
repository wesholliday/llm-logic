The word 'might' is a modal verb indicating possibility, and 'be' is a linking verb. The subject 'frazzle' is being linked to the verb 'be' and the object 'snork'. \n\nIn this context, 'snork' seems to be a possible alternative to 'frazzle', as it is likely a wordplay or a variation of 'frazzle'. However, 'quork' is not directly related to 'frazzle' or 'snork' in any obvious way. \n\nGiven the information, we can infer that 'quork' is not a likely alternative to 'frazzle' based on the given statement. \n\nAnswer: no",
