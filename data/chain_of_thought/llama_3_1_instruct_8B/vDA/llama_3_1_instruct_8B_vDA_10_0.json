            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional argument, which means it involves a conditional statement (if-then statement) and a negation of one of its premises. \n\nThe first premise is 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside'. This is a conditional statement where the antecedent (the condition) is 'the dog was inside' and the consequent (the outcome) is 'the cat was outside'. \n\nThe second premise is 'The dog was not inside', which is a negation of the antecedent of the first premise. \n\nThe conclusion is 'The cat was not outside', which is the negation of the consequent of the first premise.\n\nIn a valid argument, the conclusion must follow logically from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is the negation of the consequent of the first premise, but the second premise is the negation of the antecedent of the first premise. This is a classic example of a valid argument form known as modus tollens, which states that if 'if A then B' and 'not A', then 'not B'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
