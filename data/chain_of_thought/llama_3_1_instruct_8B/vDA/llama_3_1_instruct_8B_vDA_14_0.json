            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional statement with two premises and a conclusion. The first premise is 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den', which is a conditional statement of the form 'If P, then Q'. The second premise is 'The bear was not in the cave', which is a negation of the first part of the conditional statement. The conclusion is 'The wolf was not in the den', which is the negation of the second part of the conditional statement.\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the second premise directly contradicts the first premise, which is a classic example of a modus tollens argument. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that follows the pattern: If P, then Q; not P; therefore, not Q. In this case, P is 'the bear was in the cave', Q is 'the wolf was in the den', and the second premise 'The bear was not in the cave' is the negation of P.\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens pattern, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
