            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional statement with a negated antecedent. The first premise is 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake', which is a conditional statement. The second premise is 'The vampire was not awake', which is a negation of the antecedent of the conditional statement. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the antecedent is false, the conditional statement is automatically true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent. This is known as the 'law of excluded middle' or 'modus tollens' in logic. Therefore, if the vampire was not awake, the conditional statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is automatically true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent 'the mummy was awake'. \n\nSince the conditional statement is true, and the consequent 'the mummy was awake' is not required to be true for the conditional statement to be true, we cannot logically conclude that 'the mummy was not awake' from the given premises. The argument is not logically valid because it does not follow the rules of logical reasoning.\n\nAnswer: no",
