            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the form of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement (if-then statement) followed by a negation of the antecedent (if part). The conditional statement is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis', which can be represented as P \u2192 Q (where P is 'Jeff played basketball' and Q is 'Amy played tennis'). The second premise is the negation of the antecedent, 'Jeff did not play basketball', which is \u00acP. The conclusion is the negation of the consequent, 'Amy did not play tennis', which is \u00acQ.\n\nIn a valid argument, the conclusion must follow logically from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ), which is not necessarily true just because the antecedent (P) is negated. The conditional statement P \u2192 Q does not guarantee that Q is true when P is false; it only guarantees that if P is true, then Q must be true. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
