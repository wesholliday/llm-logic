            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional argument, which has the form: \n\nIf P, then Q\nNot P\n\u2234 Not Q\n\nIn this case, P is 'the book was written by James' and Q is 'the book is a mystery novel'. The argument is trying to conclude that if the book was not written by James, then it is not a mystery novel.\n\nTo check for validity, we can use a truth table or analyze the argument using logical rules. However, in this case, we can use a simpler method. We can substitute the given premises into the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows.\n\nGiven the first premise: If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\nGiven the second premise: The book was not written by James.\n\nIf the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\nThe book was not written by James\n\nFrom the second premise, we can infer that the first premise is not applicable, because the condition (the book was written by James) is not met. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the book is not a mystery novel based on the given premises.\n\nHowever, the argument is trying to conclude that the book is not a mystery novel, which is the opposite of the first premise. The first premise states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. The second premise states that the book was not written by James, but it does not provide any information about the book's genre.\n\nThe argument is trying to use the second premise to conclude the opposite of the first premise, which is not logically valid. The conclusion does not follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
