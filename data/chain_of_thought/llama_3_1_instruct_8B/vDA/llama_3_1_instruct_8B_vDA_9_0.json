            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional argument, which means it has a conditional statement as one of its premises. The conditional statement is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'. This can be represented as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and Q is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nThe second premise is 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt', which is the negation of P. The conclusion is 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt', which is the negation of Q.\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In a conditional argument, if the antecedent (P) is false, the consequent (Q) can be either true or false. However, the conclusion is the negation of Q, which means it is the opposite of what the conditional statement would suggest if the antecedent is false.\n\nIn this case, if Lisa did not buy the red shirt (P is false), the conditional statement does not provide any information about whether Mark bought the blue shirt (Q). The conditional statement only tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt, but it does not tell us what happens if Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The conclusion is not a necessary consequence of the premises, and it is possible for the premises to be true while the conclusion is false.\n\nAnswer: no",
