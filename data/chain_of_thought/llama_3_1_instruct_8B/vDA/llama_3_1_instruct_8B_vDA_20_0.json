            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a categorical syllogism with two premises and a conclusion. The first premise is a conditional statement, 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow', which can be represented as 'A \u2192 B'. The second premise is a negation of the antecedent of the first premise, 'The apple was not red', which can be represented as '~A'. The conclusion is the negation of the consequent of the first premise, 'The banana was not yellow', which can be represented as '~B'.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, the first premise establishes a relationship between the apple's color and the banana's color, and the second premise negates the condition that would make the banana yellow. However, the argument does not provide any information about the banana's color when the apple is not red. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the banana was not yellow based solely on the given premises.\n\nThe argument is an example of a fallacy known as affirming the consequent, which is a type of logical fallacy where a conclusion is drawn from a conditional statement by affirming the consequent, without considering the antecedent. In this case, the argument is trying to conclude that the banana was not yellow because the apple was not red, but it does not provide any information about the banana's color when the apple is not red.\n\nAnswer: no",
