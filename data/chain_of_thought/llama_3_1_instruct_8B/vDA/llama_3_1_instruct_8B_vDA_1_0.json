            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional statement with a negated antecedent. The first premise is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', which is a conditional statement of the form 'If P, then Q'. The second premise is 'Mary was not at the wedding', which is the negation of the antecedent 'P'. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the antecedent is negated, the conclusion can be either the negation of the consequent or a statement that does not necessarily follow from the negation of the antecedent. However, in this case, the conclusion is the negation of the consequent 'Sue was not at the wedding'. \n\nThe argument is an example of a form of argument known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: if P implies Q, and not P, then not Q. In this case, 'P' is 'Mary was at the wedding', 'Q' is 'Sue was at the wedding', and the negation of 'P' is 'Mary was not at the wedding'. \n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens rule of inference, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
