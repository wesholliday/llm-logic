            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional argument, which means it involves a conditional statement (if-then statement) and a negation of the antecedent (the 'if' part). The conditional statement is 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue', and the negation of the antecedent is 'The car was not red'.\n\nIn a conditional argument, if the antecedent (the 'if' part) is negated, the conclusion can be either the negation of the consequent (the 'then' part) or a statement that does not contradict the consequent. In this case, the antecedent is 'the car was red', and the consequent is 'the truck was blue'. If the antecedent is negated, the conclusion cannot be the negation of the consequent, which would be 'the truck was blue', because that would be a contradiction.\n\nHowever, the conclusion 'The truck was not blue' does not contradict the consequent 'the truck was blue'. It is a statement that does not contradict the consequent, and it is a possible conclusion when the antecedent is negated. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
