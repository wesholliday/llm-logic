            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the form of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional argument, which means it has a conditional statement as one of its premises. The conditional statement is 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest'. This can be represented as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the griffin was in the forest' and Q is 'the unicorn was in the forest'.\n\nThe second premise is 'The griffin was not in the forest', which is the negation of P. The conclusion is 'The unicorn was not in the forest', which is the negation of Q.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In a conditional argument, if the antecedent (P) is false, then the consequent (Q) can be either true or false. However, the conclusion is the negation of Q, which means it is the opposite of what the conditional statement would suggest if the antecedent is false.\n\nIn this case, the argument is using the second premise to negate the antecedent (P), which is 'The griffin was not in the forest'. This is a valid way to negate the antecedent of a conditional statement. Since the antecedent is false, the argument is not committed to the truth of the consequent (Q), which is 'the unicorn was in the forest'. Therefore, the conclusion 'The unicorn was not in the forest' is a valid conclusion that logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
