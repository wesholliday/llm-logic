            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the form of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument is a conditional argument, where the first premise is a conditional statement (If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim) and the second premise is a negation of the antecedent of the conditional (The shirt was not cotton). \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the antecedent is false, the conditional statement is automatically true, regardless of the truth value of the consequent. This is known as the \"ex falso quodlibet\" or \"explosion\" rule in classical logic. However, in this case, the second premise is not directly negating the conditional statement, but rather the antecedent of the conditional. \n\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we need to see if the conclusion (The pants were not denim) logically follows from the premises. If the shirt was not cotton, it does not necessarily mean that the pants were not denim. The pants could still be denim even if the shirt is not cotton. \n\nHowever, the argument is actually a form of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: If A -> B, and not B, then not A. In this case, the first premise is A -> B (If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim), the second premise is not B (The shirt was not cotton), and the conclusion is not A (The pants were not denim). \n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it follows the modus tollens form of argument.\n\nAnswer: yes",
