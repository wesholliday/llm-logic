            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a syllogism, specifically a form of modus tollens. Modus tollens is a logical rule that states: \n\nIf A, then B\nNot B\nTherefore, not A\n\nIn this case, the given statement is: \nIf the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\n\nThis can be rewritten as: \nIf A (whiffle was shanked), then B (whiffle tinked)\n\nThe second statement is: \nIf the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink\n\nThis can be rewritten as: \nIf not A (whiffle was not shanked), then not B (whiffle did not tink)\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink', we need to see if the original statement is in the form of modus tollens. The original statement is in the form of 'If A, then B', but the second statement is in the form of 'If not A, then not B', which is the correct form of modus tollens.\n\nHowever, the original statement is not explicitly stating that if the whiffle was not shanked, then it did not tink. It only states that if the whiffle was shanked, then it tinked. Therefore, we cannot directly infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nHowever, we can infer the second statement from the first one using the law of contrapositive, which states that if A implies B, then not B implies not A. \n\nSo, if we apply the law of contrapositive to the original statement, we get: \nIf the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nNow, we can use this statement to infer the second statement: \nIf the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink.\n\nAnswer: yes",
