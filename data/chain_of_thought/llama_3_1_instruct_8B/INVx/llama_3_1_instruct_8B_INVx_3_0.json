            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If A, then B'. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if A is true, then B must be true. However, if A is false, we cannot conclude that B is false. This is because the statement only guarantees the truth of B when A is true, but it does not guarantee the truth of B when A is false.\n\nIn this case, the given statement does not provide any information about what happens when the splat is not morphed. It only tells us that if the splat is morphed, then it quanked. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the splat was not morphed, then it did not quank.\n\nAnswer: no",
