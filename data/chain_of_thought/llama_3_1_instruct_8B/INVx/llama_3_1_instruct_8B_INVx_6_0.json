            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument involving modus tollens, a form of deductive reasoning. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: if P implies Q, and not Q, then not P. In this case, the given statement is 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink'. This is an 'if-then' statement, where the 'if' part is 'the grommet was sploffed' and the 'then' part is 'the grommet plopped the frink'. \n\nTo apply modus tollens, we need to negate the 'then' part of the statement, which becomes 'the grommet did not plop the frink'. Now, we have: 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink'. The original statement is the converse of this new statement. However, the original statement is 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink'. The negation of the original statement is 'If the grommet was not sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink'. This is because the original statement is an 'if-then' statement, and the negation of an 'if-then' statement is 'if not the condition, then not the consequence'. \n\nAnswer: yes",
