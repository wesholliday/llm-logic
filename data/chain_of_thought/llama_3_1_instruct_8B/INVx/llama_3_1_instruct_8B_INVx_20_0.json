This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the fleeg was bluttered' and Q is 'it surned'. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if P is true, then Q must be true. However, if P is false, we cannot conclude anything about Q. This is because the statement only guarantees the relationship between P and Q when P is true, not when P is false.\n\nIn this case, the original statement does not provide any information about what happens when the fleeg is not bluttered. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'If the fleeg was not bluttered, then it did not surn'.\n\nAnswer: no",
