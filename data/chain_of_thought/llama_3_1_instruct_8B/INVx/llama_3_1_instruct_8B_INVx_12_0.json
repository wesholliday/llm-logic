            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the smip was not shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the smip was shripped' and Q is 'the smip lupped the zoint'.\n\nTo infer the statement 'If the smip was not shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint', we need to apply the rule of contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. \n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint' would be 'If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped'. However, the statement we are trying to infer is 'If the smip was not shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint', which is the inverse of the contrapositive.\n\nThe inverse of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not P, then not Q'. The inverse of 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint' would be 'If the smip was not shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint'.\n\nSince the given statement is logically valid, we can infer the inverse statement 'If the smip was not shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
