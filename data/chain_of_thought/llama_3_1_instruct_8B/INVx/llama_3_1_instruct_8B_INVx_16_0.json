            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the sneg was crampled' and Q is 'the sneg sproted the frink'.\n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (P) is not met, we cannot directly infer the truth of the consequence (Q). However, we can infer the contrapositive of the statement, which is 'If not Q, then not P'. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink' is 'If the sneg did not sprot the frink, then the sneg was not crampled'. This is not the same as 'If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink', which is the statement we are trying to infer.\n\nHowever, we can use a related logical principle called modus tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' and we know that 'not Q', we can infer 'not P'. In this case, we can use modus tollens to infer 'If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink' is not directly inferable from the original statement, but we can infer 'If the sneg did not sprot the frink, then the sneg was not crampled' using the contrapositive, and then we can use the contrapositive again to infer 'If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink' is not directly inferable, but we can infer 'If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink' is not true from the contrapositive of the contrapositive which is the original statement.\n\nHowever, we can infer 'If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink' is not true from the contrapositive of the contrapositive which is the original statement.",
