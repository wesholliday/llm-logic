            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument involving a conditional statement and its converse. The given statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement of the form 'If P, then Q', where P is 'Mary was at the wedding' and Q is 'Sue was at the wedding'. \n\nThe truth of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is determined by the truth of its converse 'If not Q, then not P'. However, the converse of the given statement is 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding', which is not the same as the original statement. \n\nTo determine if 'Mary was at the wedding' is true, we need to examine the given statements more closely. We are given that 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is true and 'Sue was at the wedding' is true. This means that the antecedent of the conditional statement is not true, because if the antecedent were true, the consequent would also have to be true. However, we know that the consequent is true, so the antecedent must be false.\n\nSince the antecedent 'Mary was at the wedding' is false, we can conclude that 'Mary was at the wedding' is false.\n\nAnswer: no",
