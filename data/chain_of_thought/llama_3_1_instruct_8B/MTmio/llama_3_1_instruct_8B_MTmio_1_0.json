            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Mary was not at the wedding', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Sue might not have been at the wedding' implies that there is a possibility that Sue was not at the wedding. The second statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding' implies a conditional relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence at the wedding. \n\nTo infer 'Mary was not at the wedding', we would need to know that Sue was not at the wedding, which is a possibility according to the first statement. However, the second statement does not provide any information about Mary's presence at the wedding when Sue is not present. It only provides information about the relationship between Mary's and Sue's presence when Mary is present. \n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer 'Mary was not at the wedding' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
