            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'Mark might not have bought the blue shirt', which implies that there is a possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. The second statement is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt'. This statement implies a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. \n\nTo infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt', we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. If Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, and if Lisa buying the red shirt implies Mark buying the blue shirt, then it is possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt because if she did, Mark would have bought the blue shirt, which contradicts the possibility that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. Therefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
