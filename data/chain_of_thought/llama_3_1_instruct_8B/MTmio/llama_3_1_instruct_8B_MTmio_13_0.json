            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The car was not red', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'The truck might not have been blue', which implies that the color of the truck is uncertain. The second statement is 'If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue', which is a conditional statement. This statement does not provide any information about the actual color of the car or the truck, but it does establish a relationship between the two colors.\n\nTo infer 'The car was not red', we need to find a logical connection between the given statements. If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue according to the second statement. However, the first statement tells us that the truck might not have been blue. This creates a contradiction, as the truck cannot be both blue and not blue at the same time. Therefore, we can conclude that the car is not red, because if it were red, the truck would have to be blue, but the truck might not be blue.\n\nAnswer: yes",
