            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The doll was not plastic', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'The truck might not have been metal' introduces uncertainty about the material of the truck. The second statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal' establishes a conditional relationship between the material of the doll and the material of the truck. \n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the truck's material is uncertain. The second statement tells us that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. However, it does not provide any information about the doll's material when the truck is not metal. \n\nTo infer 'The doll was not plastic', we would need to know that the truck is not metal, which would make the conditional statement in the second statement irrelevant. However, the first statement only says 'The truck might not have been metal', which does not provide a definitive conclusion about the truck's material. Therefore, we cannot directly infer the material of the doll from the given statements.\n\nHowever, we can use a process of elimination. If the doll was plastic, then the truck must be metal, but the truck might not be metal. This means that the doll cannot be plastic if the truck is not metal. Therefore, we can infer that 'The doll was not plastic' if we assume that the truck is not metal.\n\nAnswer: yes",
