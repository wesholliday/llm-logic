            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The book was not written by James', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'The book might not be a mystery novel', which is a conditional statement indicating uncertainty about the book's genre. The second statement is 'If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel', which is a conditional statement linking James as the author to the book being a mystery novel.\n\nTo infer 'The book was not written by James', we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. If the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel, according to the second statement. However, the first statement says the book might not be a mystery novel. This creates a contradiction if we assume the book was written by James, as it would imply the book is a mystery novel, but the first statement suggests it might not be.\n\nTherefore, to resolve this contradiction, we can infer that the book was not written by James, as this would eliminate the contradiction and make both statements consistent.\n\nAnswer: yes",
