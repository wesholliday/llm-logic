            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The apple was not red', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'The banana might not have been yellow' introduces a possibility that the banana is not yellow. The second statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow' establishes a conditional relationship between the color of the apple and the banana. \n\nHowever, this conditional statement does not provide any information about the color of the apple when the banana is not yellow. It only tells us what would happen if the apple was red. Since we don't know the color of the apple, we cannot conclude that it is not red based on the given information. The possibility of the apple being red is still open, and we cannot make a definitive conclusion about its color.\n\nAnswer: no",
