This statement implies a condition or a requirement for the grooble, which is that it must be located on the quazzle. \n\nHowever, the statement does not provide any information about the grooble being in the quimble. The word 'or' is used in the original statement, but it is used to indicate an alternative condition, not to imply that the grooble must be in the quimble. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the grooble must be in the quimble based on the given statement. The statement only provides information about the quazzle, not the quimble.\n\nAnswer: no",
