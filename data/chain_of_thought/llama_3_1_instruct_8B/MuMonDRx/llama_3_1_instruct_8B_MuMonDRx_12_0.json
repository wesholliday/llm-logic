This statement implies a relationship between 'fizzle', 'zizz', and 'zooble'. However, it does not provide any information about 'froodle'. The presence of 'froodle' in the inferred statement suggests an additional option, which is not supported by the original statement. The original statement only mentions 'zizz', not 'froodle'. Therefore, we cannot infer the inclusion of 'froodle' in the relationship.\n\nAnswer: no",
