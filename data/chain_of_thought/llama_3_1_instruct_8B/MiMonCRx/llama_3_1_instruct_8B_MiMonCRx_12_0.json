            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The zibble might be quorked' from 'The zibble might be frobbed and quorked', let's break down the sentence. The phrase 'might be frobbed and quorked' is a compound predicate, where 'frobbed and quorked' are two actions that are happening together. This implies that the zibble can be both frobbed and quorked. However, the word 'and' is a conjunction that connects two independent clauses, but it does not imply that one action is a subset of the other. Therefore, we can infer that the zibble might be quorked, as it is explicitly mentioned in the compound predicate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
