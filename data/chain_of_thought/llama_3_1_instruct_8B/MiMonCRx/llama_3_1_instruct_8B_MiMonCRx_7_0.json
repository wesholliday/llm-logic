The word 'and' is a conjunction that connects two independent clauses, indicating that both actions (zibbering and floobing) are happening simultaneously or are being considered together. Since the statement explicitly mentions that the gribble might be floobed, it directly supports the inference that the gribble might be floobed. \n\nAnswer: yes",
