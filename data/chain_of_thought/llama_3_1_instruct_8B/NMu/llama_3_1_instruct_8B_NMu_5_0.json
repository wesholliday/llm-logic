This means that there is at least one possible scenario where Jeff did not play basketball. \n\nThe concept of possibility is often denoted by the word 'might', which indicates that something can happen or be the case. In this context, 'Jeff might not have played basketball' suggests that there is a possibility that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nSince the given statement already implies that it's not necessary for Jeff to have played basketball, it directly supports the idea that there is a possibility that Jeff did not play basketball. Therefore, we can infer 'Jeff might not have played basketball' from 'It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
