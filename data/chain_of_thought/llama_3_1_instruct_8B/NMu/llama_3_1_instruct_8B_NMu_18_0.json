This is because 'not must' implies possibility, as 'must' implies necessity. \n\nThe statement 'The notebook might not be in the drawer' also implies possibility, as 'might' is a modal operator that indicates possibility.\n\nSince both statements convey the idea of possibility, we can infer that 'The notebook might not be in the drawer' from 'It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
