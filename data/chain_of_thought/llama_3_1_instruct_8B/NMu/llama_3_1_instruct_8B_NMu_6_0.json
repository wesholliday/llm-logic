            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Sue might not have chosen pizza' from 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza', we need to break down the meaning of the given statement. 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza' is equivalent to 'It's possible that Sue did not choose pizza'. This is because 'must' implies necessity, and 'not' negates it, resulting in possibility. \n\nNow, if it's possible that Sue did not choose pizza, then it's indeed possible that Sue might not have chosen pizza. This is because 'might' also implies possibility. Therefore, the two statements are logically equivalent, and we can infer 'Sue might not have chosen pizza' from 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
