This is because 'not must' implies possibility. \n\nThe statement 'The shoes might not be in the closet' also implies possibility, specifically that there is a chance the shoes are not in the closet.\n\nSince both statements convey the idea of possibility, we can infer that 'The shoes might not be in the closet' from 'It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
