            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt' from 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt', we need to understand the meaning of the original statement. 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt' is equivalent to 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt' or 'It's possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt'. This is because 'must' implies necessity, and 'not' negates it, resulting in possibility. \n\nIn this case, the original statement already explicitly states that it's possible Lisa did not buy the red shirt, which is the same as saying Lisa might not have bought the red shirt. Therefore, we can directly infer 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
