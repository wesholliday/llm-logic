            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Mary might not have been at the wedding' from 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding', let's break down the statement. 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding' implies that there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding. The phrase 'must have been' indicates a necessity or a requirement, which is negated by the phrase 'it's not the case'. This suggests that there is an alternative possibility where Mary was not present at the wedding.\n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide any information about the likelihood or probability of Mary's presence at the wedding. It only negates the necessity of her presence. Therefore, we cannot infer that Mary might not have been at the wedding with certainty, as the statement only rules out the necessity of her presence, not the possibility of her absence.\n\nAnswer: no",
