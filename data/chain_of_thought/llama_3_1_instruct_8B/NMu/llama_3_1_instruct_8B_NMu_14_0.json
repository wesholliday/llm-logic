            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The milk might not be on the counter' from 'It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter', we need to understand the logical relationship between the two statements. \n\nThe statement 'It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter' is equivalent to 'It's possible that the milk is not on the counter'. This is because 'not must' implies possibility. \n\nThe statement 'The milk might not be on the counter' also implies possibility, specifically that there is a chance the milk is not on the counter.\n\nSince both statements convey the idea of possibility, we can infer that 'The milk might not be on the counter' from 'It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
