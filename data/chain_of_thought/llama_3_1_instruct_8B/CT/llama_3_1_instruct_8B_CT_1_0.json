            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical inference using the concept of contrapositive. The original statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'P \u2192 Q', where P is 'Mary was at the wedding' and Q is 'Sue was at the wedding'. \n\nThe contrapositive of this statement is 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding', which can be represented as '~Q \u2192 ~P'. \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, if we accept the original statement as true, we can logically infer that the contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
