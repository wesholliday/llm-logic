            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical inference using the concept of contrapositive. The original statement is a conditional statement in the form of 'If A, then B', where A is 'the apple was red' and B is 'the banana was yellow'. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red', we need to examine the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. \n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' would be 'If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red'. This is because we are negating both the hypothesis (the banana was yellow) and the conclusion (the apple was red) in the original statement.\n\nSince the contrapositive of the original statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer that 'If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red' is indeed a valid conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
