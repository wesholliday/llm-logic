            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton', we need to analyze the original statement and its logical structure. The original statement is a conditional statement in the form of 'If A, then B', where A is 'the shirt was cotton' and B is 'the pants were denim'. This type of statement is known as a material implication.\n\nIn a material implication, if the antecedent (A) is true, then the consequent (B) must be true. However, if the antecedent (A) is false, the consequent (B) can be either true or false. This is known as the 'material implication' rule.\n\nIn this case, the original statement is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'. This means that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. However, it does not imply that if the pants are not denim, then the shirt is not cotton.\n\nTo infer 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton', we would need a statement that says 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton', which is not given in the original statement. The original statement only provides information about the relationship between the shirt being cotton and the pants being denim, but it does not provide information about the relationship between the pants not being denim and the shirt not being cotton.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
