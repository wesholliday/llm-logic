            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza', we need to analyze the given statement 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If A, then B'. \n\nIn this case, A is 'Sue chose pizza' and B is 'Bob chose pasta'. The given statement implies that whenever Sue chooses pizza, Bob also chooses pasta. However, it does not imply that whenever Bob does not choose pasta, Sue did not choose pizza. \n\nTo infer 'If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza', we would need a statement that says 'If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza', or we would need additional information that connects the two choices in both directions. \n\nHowever, we can infer the contrapositive of the given statement, which is 'If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza' is not the contrapositive, but we can infer the contrapositive of the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive of 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta' is 'If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza'. The contrapositive of this is 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta'. The contrapositive of this is 'If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza'. The contrapositive of this is 'If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue chose pizza'. \n\nHowever, we can infer the original statement's contrapositive, which is 'If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza'. This is because the original statement is a conditional statement, and the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes",
