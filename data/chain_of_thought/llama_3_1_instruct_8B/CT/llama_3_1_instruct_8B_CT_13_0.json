            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'. This is a conditional statement, where 'if-then' relationship is established between two events. \n\nIn a conditional statement, the 'if' part is called the antecedent, and the 'then' part is called the consequent. In this case, 'the car was red' is the antecedent, and 'the truck was blue' is the consequent.\n\nThe given statement does not explicitly state that the truck is always blue when the car is red, but it does imply a relationship between the two. However, it does not provide any information about what happens when the truck is not blue.\n\nTo infer 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red', we would need to know that the relationship between the car's color and the truck's color is a bi-conditional (also known as a biconditional) relationship, which is not the case here. A bi-conditional relationship would be 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue, and if the truck was blue, then the car was red'.\n\nHowever, we can use a logical rule called 'modus tollens' to make an inference. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement 'If A, then B' and we know that 'not B', then we can infer 'not A'. In this case, we can apply modus tollens as follows: 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' is the conditional statement, and 'the truck was not blue' is the negation of the consequent. Therefore, we can infer 'the car was not red'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
