            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football', we need to analyze the original statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'Tom watched football' and Q is 'Jen watched basketball'. \n\nIn a conditional statement, the 'if-then' relationship is not necessarily bidirectional. The original statement does not imply that if Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football. It only implies that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. Therefore, we cannot directly infer the reverse relationship.\n\nHowever, we can use the concept of contrapositive to infer the reverse relationship. The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. In this case, the contrapositive of the original statement would be 'If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football'. This is because the contrapositive maintains the same 'if-then' relationship but swaps the conditions.\n\nAnswer: yes",
