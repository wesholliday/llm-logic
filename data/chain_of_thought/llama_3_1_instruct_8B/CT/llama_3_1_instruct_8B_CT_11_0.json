            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate', we need to analyze the original statement and its logical structure. The original statement is a conditional statement in the form of 'If A, then B', where A is 'the cake was chocolate' and B is 'the muffins were blueberry'. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if A is true, then B must be true. However, if we want to infer the converse of the original statement, we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. \n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the original statement would be 'If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate'. This is because we are considering the opposite of B (the muffins not being blueberry) and the opposite of A (the cake not being chocolate).\n\nSince the original statement is a valid conditional statement, its contrapositive is also a valid logical inference. Therefore, we can infer 'If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
