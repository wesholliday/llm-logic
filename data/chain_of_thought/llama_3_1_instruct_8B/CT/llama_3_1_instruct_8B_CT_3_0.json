            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James', we need to analyze the original statement and its logical structure. The original statement is 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the book was written by James' and Q is 'the book is a mystery novel'.\n\nTo infer 'If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James', we need to negate both the original statement and its components. The negation of the original statement would be 'If the book was written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel', which is not the statement we want to infer.\n\nHowever, we can use the contrapositive of the original statement, which is 'If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James'. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning it has the same truth value.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
