            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball', we need to analyze the given statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'Jeff played basketball' and Q is 'Amy played tennis'. \n\nIn a conditional statement, the 'if' part (P) is called the antecedent, and the 'then' part (Q) is called the consequent. The statement does not explicitly state the converse, which is 'If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball'. However, we can use the concept of contrapositive to infer the converse.\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. In this case, the contrapositive of 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis' is 'If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball'. \n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement, we can infer that 'If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
