            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the vampire was awake' and Q is 'the mummy was awake'. \n\nTo infer 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake', we need to negate both the hypothesis and the conclusion of the original statement. This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nIn this case, the original statement is 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake'. The contrapositive would be 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake'. This is a valid logical inference because it preserves the original relationship between the two statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
