            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt' from 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. \n\nThe original statement is a conditional statement in the form of 'If A, then B'. This means that if the condition A is true, then B must be true. However, it does not guarantee that if B is false, A must be false. \n\nIn this case, 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, Mark must have bought the blue shirt. But it does not imply that if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, Lisa did not buy the red shirt. \n\nIn fact, Mark could have not bought the blue shirt for any number of reasons unrelated to Lisa's purchase of the red shirt. Therefore, we cannot logically infer 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
