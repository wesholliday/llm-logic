            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical inference using the concept of contrapositive. The original statement is a conditional statement in the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'Alex finished the race' and B is 'Chris finished the race'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If not B, then not A', which is 'If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race'. \n\nTo determine if we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement, we need to check if the original statement is a universal conditional statement. A universal conditional statement is one where the 'if' clause is a necessary condition for the 'then' clause. In this case, the original statement does not explicitly state that Alex's finishing the race is a necessary condition for Chris's finishing the race. It only states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race, which does not necessarily imply that Chris's finishing the race is dependent on Alex's finishing the race.\n\nHowever, we can still infer the contrapositive from the original statement because the original statement is a universal conditional statement in the context of the information given. The original statement implies that Alex's finishing the race is a sufficient condition for Chris's finishing the race, but it does not provide any information that would contradict the idea that Chris's finishing the race is a necessary condition for Alex's finishing the race. Therefore, we can logically infer the contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: yes",
