            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic', we need to analyze the original statement and its logical structure. The original statement is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the doll was plastic' and Q is 'the truck was metal'. \n\nTo infer 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic', we need to negate both the original condition (P) and the original consequence (Q), which results in 'If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal'. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. \n\nSince the contrapositive of the original statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
