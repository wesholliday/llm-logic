            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument involving modus tollens, a form of deductive reasoning. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: if P \u2192 Q, then not Q \u2192 not P. In this case, the given statement is 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest', which can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is 'the griffin was in the forest' and Q is 'the unicorn was in the forest'. \n\nTo apply modus tollens, we need to negate the conclusion (Q) and then negate the premise (P). The negation of Q is 'the unicorn was not in the forest', and the negation of P is 'the griffin was not in the forest'. Therefore, we can infer that if the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
