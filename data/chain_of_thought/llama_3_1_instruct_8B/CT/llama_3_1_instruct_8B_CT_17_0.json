            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical inference using the concept of contrapositive. The original statement is in the form of 'If A, then B', where A is 'Ben ate pasta' and B is 'Kate ate the salad'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If not B, then not A', which is 'If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta'. \n\nTo determine if the inference is valid, we need to check if the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. In this case, the contrapositive is indeed logically equivalent to the original statement, as it maintains the same relationship between the two events. Therefore, we can infer that if Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
