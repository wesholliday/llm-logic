            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park', we need to analyze the original statement 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'. This is a conditional statement, where the first part 'Joe went to the park' is the antecedent (or condition), and the second part 'Lucy went to the zoo' is the consequent (or result).\n\nThe original statement does not imply a direct causal relationship between the two events, but rather a correlation. It does not state that if Joe went to the park, Lucy must go to the zoo, but rather that if Joe went to the park, it is a condition that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement we want to infer: 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park'. This is a contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the original statement would be 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park'. However, the original statement does not provide enough information to support this inference. The original statement only tells us that if Joe went to the park, Lucy went to the zoo, but it does not tell us what happens if Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
