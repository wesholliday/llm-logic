            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The keys might be in the drawer', we need to analyze the given statement 'The keys might be in the drawer or on the table'. This statement presents two possible locations for the keys: the drawer and the table. The use of 'or' indicates that these are mutually exclusive possibilities, meaning the keys are either in the drawer or on the table, but not both at the same time. \n\nSince the statement explicitly mentions the drawer as one of the possible locations, it implies that the keys could indeed be in the drawer. This is not a definitive statement, but rather a possibility, as indicated by the word 'might'. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the keys might be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
