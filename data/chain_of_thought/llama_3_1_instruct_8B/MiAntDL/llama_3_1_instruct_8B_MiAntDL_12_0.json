            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'The project might be completed by Friday or extended' implies that there are two possible outcomes: either the project is completed by Friday or it is extended. The word 'or' is used to indicate an alternative, which means that both options are mutually exclusive. This suggests that if the project is not extended, it must be completed by Friday. However, the statement does not explicitly state that the project will be completed by Friday; it only mentions it as one of the possible outcomes. Therefore, we can infer that the project might be completed by Friday, but we cannot be certain.\n\nAnswer: yes",
