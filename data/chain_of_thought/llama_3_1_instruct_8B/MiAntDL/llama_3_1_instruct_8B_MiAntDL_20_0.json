            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'The event might be formal or semi-formal' implies that there are two possibilities for the event - it could be formal or it could be semi-formal. This means that the event is not necessarily formal, but it could be. The word 'or' is used to indicate an alternative, which suggests that the event has the potential to be formal, but it's not a certainty. Therefore, we can infer that the event might be formal, as it is one of the possibilities mentioned. \n\nAnswer: yes",
