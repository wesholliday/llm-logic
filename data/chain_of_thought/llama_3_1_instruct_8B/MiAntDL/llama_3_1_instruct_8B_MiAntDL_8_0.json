            "content": "Explanation: To infer 'The restaurant might be closed on Mondays', we need to analyze the given statement 'The restaurant might be closed on Mondays or open for limited hours'. This statement presents two possibilities: the restaurant might be closed on Mondays or it might be open for limited hours on Mondays. The use of 'or' indicates that these are two separate and distinct possibilities, rather than mutually exclusive options. Therefore, we can infer that the restaurant might indeed be closed on Mondays, as it is one of the two possible scenarios presented in the statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
