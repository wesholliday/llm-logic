The use of 'or' indicates that these are mutually exclusive possibilities, and the speaker is acknowledging that one of these two outcomes is a possibility. This means that the speaker is considering the possibility of the meeting being at 2 PM, as it is one of the two options presented. Therefore, we can infer that 'The meeting might be at 2 PM' is a valid conclusion based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
