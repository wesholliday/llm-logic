This is an 'or' condition, which means that the package could be delivered on either of these two days, but not necessarily on both. The statement does not rule out the possibility of the package being delivered today, and in fact, it explicitly mentions it as one of the possible options. Therefore, we can infer that the package might be delivered today.\n\nAnswer: yes",
