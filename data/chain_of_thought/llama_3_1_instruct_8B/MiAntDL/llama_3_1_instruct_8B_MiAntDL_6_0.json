The word 'or' is used to indicate that these two outcomes are mutually exclusive, and only one of them can occur. Since the statement explicitly mentions both possibilities, we can infer that the concert might indeed be sold out, as it is one of the two possible outcomes mentioned. \n\nAnswer: yes",
