The first statement says, \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the dog being inside) is true, then the consequence (the cat being outside) is also true. The second statement says, \"The dog was inside.\" \n\nWe can use the second statement as the condition in the first statement. Since the condition (the dog being inside) is true, we can conclude that the consequence (the cat being outside) is also true. Therefore, we can infer that the cat was outside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
