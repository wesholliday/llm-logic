The first statement says \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the vampire being awake) is true, then the consequence (the mummy being awake) is also true. The second statement simply states that the vampire was awake. \n\nSince the second statement directly states that the vampire was awake, we can use this information to evaluate the first statement. Given that the vampire was indeed awake, we can apply the condition of the first statement, which is also true. Therefore, according to the first statement, if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake. Since the condition is met (the vampire is awake), we can conclude that the consequence (the mummy being awake) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
