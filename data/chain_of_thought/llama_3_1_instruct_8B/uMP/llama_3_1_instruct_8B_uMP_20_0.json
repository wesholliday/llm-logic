            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument, specifically a syllogism. To determine if we can infer that the banana was yellow, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the consequence (the banana being yellow) must also be true. The second statement is \"The apple was red.\" This is a simple statement that provides the condition for the first statement.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the banana was yellow, we need to see if the condition (the apple being red) is true. Since the second statement confirms that the apple was indeed red, we can use the first statement to conclude that the banana must be yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
