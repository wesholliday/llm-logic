            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that Jen watched basketball, we need to analyze the given information. The first statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequence (Jen watched basketball) is also true. The second statement \"Tom watched football\" is a fact that confirms the condition in the first statement. Since the condition is true, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that the consequence is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
