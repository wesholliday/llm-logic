The first statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the consequence (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true. The second statement \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is a fact that confirms the condition in the first statement. Since the condition is true, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that the consequence must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
