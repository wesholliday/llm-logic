            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that the book is a mystery novel, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement says that if the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. This is a conditional statement, where the condition is \"the book was written by James\" and the consequence is \"the book is a mystery novel.\" The second statement simply confirms that the book was written by James. \n\nTo make an inference, we need to see if the condition in the first statement is met. Since the second statement confirms that the book was written by James, the condition is indeed met. Therefore, we can apply the consequence of the first statement to the situation.\n\nSince the condition is met, and the consequence is that the book is a mystery novel, we can logically conclude that the book is a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: yes",
