If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n2. Mary was at the wedding.\n\nWe can use the first statement as a conditional statement, where the condition is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and the consequence is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that if the condition is true, then the consequence must also be true.\n\nSince we know that the condition \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true (from statement 2), we can logically conclude that the consequence \"Sue was at the wedding\" must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
