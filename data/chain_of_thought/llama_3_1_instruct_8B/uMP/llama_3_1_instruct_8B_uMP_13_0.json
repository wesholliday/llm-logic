            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that the truck was blue, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the car being red) is met, then the consequence (the truck being blue) follows. The second statement is \"The car was red.\" This statement directly states the condition mentioned in the first statement.\n\nSince the condition (the car being red) is met, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that the consequence (the truck being blue) must also be true. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the truck was indeed blue.\n\nAnswer: yes",
