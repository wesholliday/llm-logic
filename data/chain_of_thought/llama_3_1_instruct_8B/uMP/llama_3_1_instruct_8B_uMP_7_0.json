If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n2. Alex finished the race.\n\nWe can use the first statement as a conditional statement, where 'if-then' is the relationship between Alex and Chris. The second statement tells us that the condition (Alex finished the race) is true. \n\nTo determine if we can infer that Chris finished the race, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, since the condition (Alex finished the race) is true, the conclusion (Chris finished the race) logically follows from the first premise.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Chris finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
