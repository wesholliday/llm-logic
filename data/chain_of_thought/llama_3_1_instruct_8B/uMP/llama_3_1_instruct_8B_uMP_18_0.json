The first statement says that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This is a conditional statement, indicating a relationship between the material of the doll and the material of the truck. The second statement simply confirms that the doll was plastic. \n\nSince the second statement directly states that the doll was plastic, we can use this information to trigger the conditional statement from the first statement. The conditional statement says that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. Since we know the doll is plastic, we can conclude that the truck must be metal according to the given condition.\n\nAnswer: yes",
