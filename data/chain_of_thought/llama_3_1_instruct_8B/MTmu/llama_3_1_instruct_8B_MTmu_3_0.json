            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The book was not written by James', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel' is a conditional statement. It implies that if the antecedent (the book was written by James) is true, then the consequent (the book must be a mystery novel) is also true. The second statement 'It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel' is a negation of the consequent of the first statement. \n\nTo infer 'The book was not written by James', we need to find a logical contradiction or a contradiction that leads to the negation of the antecedent. However, the given statements do not directly provide a contradiction that leads to the negation of the antecedent. The first statement only implies that if the book was written by James, it must be a mystery novel, but it does not provide any information about the book not being written by James. The second statement only negates the consequent, which does not directly lead to the negation of the antecedent.\n\nHowever, we can use a technique called modus tollens to analyze this situation. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: if P implies Q, and not Q, then not P. In this case, P is 'the book was written by James' and Q is 'the book must be a mystery novel'. The first statement implies that if P is true, then Q is true. The second statement says that Q is not true. Therefore, we can apply modus tollens to conclude that P (the book was written by James) is not true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
