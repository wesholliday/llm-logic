            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement. It implies that if the condition (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the consequence (Mark must have bought the blue shirt) must also be true. However, the second statement 'It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt' is a negation of the consequence of the first statement. This means that the condition (Lisa bought the red shirt) might still be true, but the consequence (Mark must have bought the blue shirt) is not true.\n\nGiven that the consequence of the first statement is not true, we cannot directly conclude that the condition (Lisa bought the red shirt) is not true. The condition and the consequence are not necessarily related in a way that if the consequence is not true, the condition must also be not true. Therefore, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
