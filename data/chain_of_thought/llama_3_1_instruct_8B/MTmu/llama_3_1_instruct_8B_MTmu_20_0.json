            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The apple was not red' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow'. This is a conditional statement, where the condition is 'the apple was red' and the consequence is 'the banana must have been yellow'. \n\nThe second statement is 'It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow'. This statement is a negation of the consequence of the first statement.\n\nTo infer 'The apple was not red', we need to find a logical connection between the given statements and the conclusion. \n\nIf the banana must have been yellow if the apple was red, and it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow, then it's possible that the apple was not red, because the condition for the banana to be yellow (the apple being red) is not met.\n\nHowever, we cannot be certain that the apple was not red, because there could be other reasons why the banana is not yellow, not related to the color of the apple. But we can say that if the banana is not yellow, it's possible that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
