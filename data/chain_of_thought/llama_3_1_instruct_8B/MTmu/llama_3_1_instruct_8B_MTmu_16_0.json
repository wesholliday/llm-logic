            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The shirt was not cotton', we need to analyze the given statements and their logical implications. \n\nThe first statement is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim'. This is a conditional statement, where the condition is 'the shirt was cotton' and the consequence is 'the pants must have been denim'. \n\nThe second statement is 'It's not the case that the pants must have been denim'. This statement is equivalent to saying 'The pants must not have been denim', which is the negation of the consequence of the first statement.\n\nTo infer 'The shirt was not cotton', we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. If the pants must not have been denim, it doesn't necessarily mean the shirt was not cotton. However, if we combine this with the first statement, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton because if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim, but we know the pants must not have been denim. This creates a contradiction with the first statement, implying that the condition 'the shirt was cotton' cannot be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
