            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Joe did not go to the park', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo' is a conditional statement. It implies that if the condition (Joe went to the park) is true, then the consequence (Lucy must have gone to the zoo) must also be true. However, the second statement 'It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo' suggests that the consequence of the first statement is not necessarily true. This means that we cannot be certain if Joe went to the park or not, because the condition of the first statement is not explicitly denied. \n\nHowever, we can use a logical rule called modus tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement 'If A, then B' and we know that 'not B', then we can infer 'not A'. In this case, the conditional statement is 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo', and 'not B' is 'It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo'. Therefore, we can apply modus tollens to infer that 'not A', which is 'Joe did not go to the park'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
