            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Mary was not at the wedding', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding' is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue must have been at the wedding) is also true. However, the second statement 'It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding' is a negation of the consequence of the first statement. This implies that the condition (Mary was at the wedding) might still be true, but the consequence (Sue must have been at the wedding) is not true.\n\nGiven that the consequence of the first statement is not true, we cannot directly infer that the condition (Mary was at the wedding) is not true. The condition and the consequence are not necessarily related in a way that if the consequence is not true, the condition must also be not true. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Mary was not at the wedding' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
