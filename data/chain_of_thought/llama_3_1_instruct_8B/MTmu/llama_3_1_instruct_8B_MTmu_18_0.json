            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The doll was not plastic', we need to analyze the given statements and their logical implications. \n\nThe first statement is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal'. This is a conditional statement, where the condition is 'the doll was plastic' and the consequence is 'the truck must have been metal'. \n\nThe second statement is 'It's not the case that the truck must have been metal'. This statement is the negation of the consequence of the first statement. \n\nTo infer 'The doll was not plastic', we need to find a logical connection between the given statements and the conclusion. \n\nIf the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. However, it's not the case that the truck must have been metal. This implies that the condition 'the doll was plastic' might not be true, because if it were true, the consequence 'the truck must have been metal' would also be true, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The doll was not plastic' because if the doll were plastic, the truck would have to be metal, but it's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\n\nAnswer: yes",
