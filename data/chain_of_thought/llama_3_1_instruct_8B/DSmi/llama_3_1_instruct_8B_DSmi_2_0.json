The first statement 'Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table' presents two possibilities: the book is on the shelf or it is on the table. The second statement 'The book might not be resting on the table' implies that there is a possibility that the book is not on the table. \n\nGiven that the book might not be on the table, we can eliminate the possibility of the book being on the table. Since the first statement only presents two possibilities (the book being on the shelf or on the table), and we have eliminated the possibility of the book being on the table, the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
