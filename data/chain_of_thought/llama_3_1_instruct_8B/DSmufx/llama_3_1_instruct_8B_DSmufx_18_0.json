'Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked' can be rewritten as 'The shank must be nugged or the shank is plooked'. This is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the conditions must be true.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the shank must be nugged' can be rewritten as 'The shank does not have to be nugged'. This is the negation of the first condition in the disjunction.\n\nGiven that the second condition is not negated, we can conclude that the shank is indeed plooked, as the disjunction still holds true even if the first condition is false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
