            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The splat is morphed', let's break down the given statements. \n\n1. 'Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed' is a disjunction, which means it is true if at least one of the statements is true. This can be represented as P \u2228 Q, where P is 'the splat must be quanked' and Q is 'the splat is morphed'.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the splat must be quanked' is a negation of the statement 'the splat must be quanked', which can be represented as \u00acP.\n\nGiven that P \u2228 Q is true and \u00acP is also true, we can use a logical rule called 'Disjunctive Syllogism' to infer that Q must be true. Disjunctive Syllogism states that if P \u2228 Q is true and \u00acP is true, then Q must be true.\n\nTherefore, since we have P \u2228 Q and \u00acP, we can conclude that Q (the splat is morphed) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
