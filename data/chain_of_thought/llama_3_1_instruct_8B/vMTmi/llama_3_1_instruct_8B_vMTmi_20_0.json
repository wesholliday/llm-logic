            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a form of argument with two premises and a conclusion. The first premise is a conditional statement, which means it has two parts: the antecedent (the condition) and the consequent (the result). In this case, the antecedent is \"the apple was red\" and the consequent is \"the banana must have been yellow.\" The second premise is a statement of possibility, which is \"the banana might not have been yellow.\" The conclusion is a negation of the antecedent, \"the apple was not red.\"\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. We can do this by using a truth table or by analyzing the argument's form. In this case, the argument is an example of a modus tollens argument, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: if P implies Q, and not Q, then not P.\n\nIn this argument, the first premise is \"if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow,\" which is equivalent to \"if P, then Q.\" The second premise is \"the banana might not have been yellow,\" which is equivalent to \"not Q.\" The conclusion is \"the apple was not red,\" which is equivalent to \"not P.\" Since the argument follows the modus tollens form, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
