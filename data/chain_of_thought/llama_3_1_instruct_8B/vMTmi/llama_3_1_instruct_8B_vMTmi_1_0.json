            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the form of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logic. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement (If-Then statement) and a negation of the consequent. The first premise is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding', which is a conditional statement. The second premise is 'Sue might not have been at the wedding', which is a statement of possibility. The conclusion is 'Mary was not at the wedding'.\n\nTo evaluate the argument's validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there. This implies that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary could not have been there. However, the second premise states that Sue might not have been at the wedding, which is a possibility, not a certainty. This means that we cannot conclude that Mary was not at the wedding based on the information given.\n\nThe argument is trying to use the possibility of Sue not being at the wedding to conclude that Mary was not at the wedding. However, the possibility of Sue not being at the wedding does not necessarily imply that Mary was not at the wedding. It's possible that Sue was at the wedding, and it's also possible that Mary was at the wedding. The argument is trying to use a possibility to conclude a certainty, which is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
