            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that Mary might not have been at the wedding, we need to consider the information given. The statement \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" suggests that there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding. However, this does not necessarily imply that Mary might not have been at the wedding. It only tells us that it's not a requirement or a necessity for her to be there. It's possible that Mary was at the wedding, but it's not a must. The statement is more about the absence of a requirement rather than the presence of an absence. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that Mary might not have been at the wedding from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
