The statement says \"It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair.\" This statement is a negation of a universal statement, which means it's saying that there is at least one possible scenario where the jacket is not draped over the chair. In other words, it's not a requirement for the jacket to be draped over the chair. This implies that there are multiple possibilities, and the jacket might not be draped over the chair in some of those scenarios. Therefore, we can infer that the jacket might not be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
