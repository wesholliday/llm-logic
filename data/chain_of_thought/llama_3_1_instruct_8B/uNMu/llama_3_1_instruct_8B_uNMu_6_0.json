            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that Sue might not have chosen pizza, we need to consider the information given. The statement \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" suggests that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza. This is because \"must\" implies a necessity or a requirement, and if that necessity is removed, it leaves room for other possibilities. However, this statement does not directly imply that Sue did not choose pizza; it only removes the necessity of her choosing pizza. Therefore, we can infer that Sue might not have chosen pizza, but we cannot be certain.\n\nAnswer: yes",
