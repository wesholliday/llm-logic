The statement says \"It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\" This statement is a negation of a universal statement, which means it's saying that there is at least one possible scenario where the watch is not charging on the dresser. \n\nIn logic, this type of statement is known as a \"not all\" statement, which is equivalent to saying \"there exists at least one.\" Therefore, the statement is indicating that there is at least one possible scenario where the watch is not charging on the dresser. This means we can infer that the watch might not be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
