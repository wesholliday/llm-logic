In other words, the meeting could either be cancelled or it could still be scheduled, depending on the circumstances. This statement does not provide any information about the current status of the meeting, only the potential outcome. Therefore, we can infer that the meeting might be scheduled or cancelled, as both options are still on the table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
