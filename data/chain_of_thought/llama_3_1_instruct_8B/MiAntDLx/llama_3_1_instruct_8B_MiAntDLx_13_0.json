            "content": "Explanation: To infer 'The wozzle might be in zooble', we need to analyze the given statement 'The wozzle might be in zooble or gribble'. This statement is a disjunction, which means it presents two possibilities: either the wozzle is in zooble or it is in gribble. The use of 'or' indicates that these are the only two possible locations for the wozzle. \n\nSince the statement does not provide any information that would suggest the wozzle is in both places or in neither place, we can infer that the wozzle might indeed be in zooble. This is because the statement does not exclude the possibility of the wozzle being in zooble, and it only presents zooble as one of the two possible locations.\n\nAnswer: yes",
