The statement contains a disjunction, which is an 'or' condition. This means that the blurble might be blimple by either zizz or zazzle. Since the statement does not provide any information that would rule out the possibility of zizz being the cause, we can infer that the blurble might indeed be blimple by zizz.\n\nAnswer: yes",
