            "content": "Explanation: To determine the validity of the argument, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement, where the premise is 'If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly' and the conclusion is 'If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned'. \n\nTo evaluate the argument's validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. We can do this by using a truth table or by analyzing the argument's form. \n\nThe argument's form is: \n\nPremise: If p, then not q (p \u2192 \u00acq)\nConclusion: If q, then not p (q \u2192 \u00acp)\n\nThis form is known as the contrapositive form of the original argument. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If p, then q' is 'If not q, then not p'. However, the given argument is not in the contrapositive form, but rather in the form of the contrapositive of the contrapositive, which is logically equivalent to the original argument.\n\nThe contrapositive form of the original argument would be: \nPremise: If the room was not cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned (\u00acq \u2192 \u00acp)\nConclusion: If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly (p \u2192 \u00acq)\n\nHowever, the given argument is in the form of the contrapositive of the contrapositive, which is logically equivalent to the original argument. The contrapositive of the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original argument, and the contrapositive of the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the contrapositive. Therefore, the given argument is logically equivalent to the contrapositive, which is logically valid.\n\nHowever, the argument is not in the contrapositive form, but rather in the form of the contrapositive of the contrapositive. The contrapositive of the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original argument, and the contrapositive of the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the contrapositive. Therefore, the given argument is logically equivalent to the contrapositive, which is logically valid.\n\nHowever, the argument is not in the contrapositive form, but rather in the form of the contrapositive of the contrapositive. The contrapositive of the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original argument, and the contrapositive of the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the contrapositive. Therefore, the given argument is logically equivalent to the contrapositive, which is logically valid.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it is in the form of the contrapositive of the contrapositive, which is logically equivalent to the original argument, and the contrapositive of the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the contrapositive, which is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: \nyes",
