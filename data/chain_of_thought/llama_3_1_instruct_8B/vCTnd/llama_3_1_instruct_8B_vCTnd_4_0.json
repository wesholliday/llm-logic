            "content": "Explanation: To determine the validity of the argument, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional statement with two conditional statements. The first premise is 'If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently.' This can be represented as P \u2192 \u00acD, where P is 'Ben studied' and D is 'Ben studied diligently.' The conclusion is 'If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study,' which can be represented as D \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nTo check for validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. We can use a truth table to analyze the argument. However, in this case, we can also use logical rules to simplify the argument.\n\nThe first premise is P \u2192 \u00acD. This means that if P is true, then \u00acD must be true. The conclusion is D \u2192 \u00acP, which is the contrapositive of the first premise. The contrapositive of a conditional statement P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. In this case, the contrapositive of P \u2192 \u00acD is \u00ac\u00acD \u2192 \u00acP, which is equivalent to D \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, it is logically equivalent to the premise. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
