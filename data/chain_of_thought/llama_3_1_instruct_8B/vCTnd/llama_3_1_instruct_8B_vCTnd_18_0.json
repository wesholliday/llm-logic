            "content": "Explanation: To determine the validity of the argument, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement, where the premise is 'If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth' and the conclusion is 'If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed'. \n\nTo check for validity, we can use a truth table or analyze the argument's form. However, in this case, we can see that the argument is actually an example of a contrapositive argument. The contrapositive of the premise is 'If the issue was not discussed in depth, then it was not discussed', and the contrapositive of the conclusion is also 'If the issue was not discussed, then it was not discussed in depth'. \n\nThe argument is actually a contrapositive of the original premise and conclusion, which means it is logically equivalent to the original argument. This means that if the original argument is valid, the contrapositive argument is also valid. However, the contrapositive argument is not the same as the original argument, but rather its equivalent form.\n\nThe original argument is actually a form of a contrapositive argument, but it is not a direct contrapositive of the original premise and conclusion. The original premise is 'If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth', and the conclusion is 'If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed'. \n\nThe original argument is actually a form of a modus tollens argument, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: If A -> B, then not B, then not A. In this case, the original premise is 'If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth', and the conclusion is 'If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed'. \n\nThe original premise is not directly in the form of 'If A, then not B', but rather 'If A, then not C', and the conclusion is 'If C, then not A'. However, we can still apply the modus tollens rule by using the contrapositive of the premise, which is 'If the issue was not discussed in depth, then it was discussed'. \n\nUsing the contrapositive of the premise, we can see that the original argument is actually a form of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Therefore, the original argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
