            "content": "Explanation: To determine the validity of the argument, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement, where the premise is 'If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice' and the conclusion is 'If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered'.\n\nLet's break down the argument step by step:\n\n1. The premise is 'If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice'. This is a conditional statement where the antecedent (the condition) is 'advice was offered' and the consequent (the outcome) is 'it was not helpful advice'.\n\n2. The conclusion is 'If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered'. This is also a conditional statement where the antecedent is 'helpful advice was offered' and the consequent is 'advice was not offered'.\n\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. We can do this by trying to find a counterexample or by using a truth table.\n\nHowever, in this case, we can use a more intuitive approach. The premise states that if advice was offered, it was not helpful. This implies that the advice offered was not helpful. The conclusion states that if helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered. This seems to be a contradictory statement, as it implies that if helpful advice was offered, then it was not offered, which is a logical contradiction.\n\nHowever, we can see that the argument is actually an example of a valid form of argument known as modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument where if we have the following form: \n\nP \u2192 Q\n\u00acQ\n\u2234 \u00acP\n\nIn this case, the premise 'If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice' is equivalent to 'P \u2192 \u00acQ' where P is 'advice was offered' and Q is 'advice was helpful'. The conclusion 'If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered' is equivalent to '\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP'. \n\nTherefore, the argument is actually an example of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument.\n\nAnswer: yes",
