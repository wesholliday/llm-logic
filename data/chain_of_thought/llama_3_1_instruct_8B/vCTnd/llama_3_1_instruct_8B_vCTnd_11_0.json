            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional argument, which means it involves if-then statements. The premise is 'If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables' and the conclusion is 'If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store'. \n\nTo check for validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. We can do this by using a truth table or by analyzing the argument's form. \n\nThe argument's form is: \n\nPremise: If P, then not Q\nConclusion: If not Q, then not P\n\nThis form is known as the contrapositive form of the original argument. The contrapositive of an argument is logically equivalent to the original argument, meaning that if the original argument is true, then the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa. \n\nSince the argument's form is the contrapositive, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
