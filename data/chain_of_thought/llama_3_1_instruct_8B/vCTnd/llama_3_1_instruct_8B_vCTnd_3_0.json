            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a form of argument by contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. \n\nThe given premise is 'If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal'. This can be rewritten as 'If A (I ate a meal), then not B (I did not eat a large meal)'. The contrapositive of this statement would be 'If I ate a large meal (not A), then I did not eat a meal (not B)'. \n\nHowever, the conclusion of the argument is 'If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal', which is 'If B, then not A'. This is the inverse of the contrapositive, not the contrapositive itself. The inverse of a statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not A, then not B'. \n\nThe argument is not logically valid because it does not follow the correct form of a valid argument. The conclusion does not follow from the premise, as it is the inverse of the contrapositive, not the contrapositive itself.\n\nAnswer: no",
