            "content": "Explanation: To determine the validity of the argument, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement, where the premise is 'If a recommendation was made, then it was not a strong recommendation' and the conclusion is 'If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made'. \n\nTo check for validity, we can use a truth table or analyze the argument's form. However, in this case, we can use a more intuitive approach by considering the meaning of the statements. The premise states that if a recommendation was made, then it was not strong. This implies that a recommendation and a strong recommendation are mutually exclusive. \n\nThe conclusion states that if a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made. This statement is essentially the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. In this case, the contrapositive of the premise is 'If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made'. \n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and the contrapositive of a true statement is also true, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
