The notebook is either in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\n2. The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the notebook is in one of two places: the drawer or the nightstand. The second statement tells us that it's possible the notebook is not on the nightstand. \n\nHowever, the second statement does not provide any information about the notebook's location in relation to the drawer. It only tells us about the possibility of it not being on the nightstand. \n\nSince we have no information about the notebook not being in the drawer, we cannot infer that the notebook is in the drawer based on the given statements. The information provided does not rule out the possibility of the notebook being in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: no",
