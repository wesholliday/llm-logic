The statement \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist\" implies that these are the only two possible locations for the watch. However, it also mentions that \"the watch might not be on his wrist,\" which introduces a third possibility: the watch is not on his wrist and not on the dresser. Since this third possibility is not accounted for in the initial statement, we cannot conclude that the watch is charging on the dresser based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
