Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden.\n2. Fido might not be in the garden.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Fido's possible locations are limited to being either inside or in the garden. The second statement tells us that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. However, it does not provide any information about Fido's location being inside.\n\nConsidering the first statement, if Fido is not in the garden, then Fido must be inside. But the second statement only tells us that Fido might not be in the garden, not that Fido is definitely not in the garden. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Fido is inside based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
