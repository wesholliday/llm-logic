            "content": "Explanation: To determine if it necessarily follows that 'Alex finished the race' is true, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical implications. The first statement is 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race', which is a conditional statement. This statement implies that if the condition (Alex finished the race) is true, then the consequence (Chris finished the race) must also be true. The second statement is 'Chris finished the race', which is a simple statement stating a fact.\n\nGiven that 'Chris finished the race' is true, we can use the first statement to infer that the condition 'Alex finished the race' must also be true, because the condition is necessary for the consequence to be true. This is a classic example of a modus ponens logical argument, where we have a conditional statement and the consequent, and we can conclude the antecedent.\n\nAnswer: yes",
