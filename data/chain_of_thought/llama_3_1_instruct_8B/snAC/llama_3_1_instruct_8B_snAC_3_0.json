            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the statement 'The book was written by James' is necessarily true, we need to analyze the given information. The first statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (the book was written by James) is met, then the consequence (the book is a mystery novel) follows. However, the second statement 'The book is a mystery novel' does not provide any information about who wrote the book. It only confirms that the book is a mystery novel. \n\nIn a conditional statement, the condition is not necessarily true just because the consequence is true. For example, 'If it is raining, then the streets are wet' does not mean that the streets are wet just because it is raining. The streets could be wet for other reasons. Similarly, in this case, the book being a mystery novel does not necessarily mean that it was written by James. There could be other authors who wrote a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that 'The book was written by James' is necessarily true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
