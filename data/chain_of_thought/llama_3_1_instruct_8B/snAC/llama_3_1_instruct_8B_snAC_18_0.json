            "content": "Explanation: To determine if it necessarily follows that 'The doll was plastic' is true, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical connections. The first statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (the doll being plastic) is true, then the consequence (the truck being metal) must also be true. However, the truth of the consequence does not guarantee the truth of the condition. \n\nIn this case, we are given that 'The truck was metal' is true. This is the consequence of the first statement. Since the consequence is true, it does not necessarily mean that the condition (the doll being plastic) is true. The condition could be false, and the consequence could still be true. This is because the conditional statement only guarantees the consequence if the condition is true, but it does not guarantee the condition itself.\n\nFor example, consider the following: 'If it is raining, then the streets are wet.' This statement is true, but it does not mean that it is actually raining. The streets could be wet due to other reasons, such as a sprinkler system. Similarly, in this case, the truck being metal does not necessarily mean that the doll is plastic.\n\nAnswer: no",
