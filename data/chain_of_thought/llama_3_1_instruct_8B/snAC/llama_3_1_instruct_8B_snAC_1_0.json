            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. The statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement, which can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is 'Mary was at the wedding' and Q is 'Sue was at the wedding'. This statement does not imply that if Q is true, then P must be true. It only implies that if P is true, then Q must be true. \n\nIn this case, we are given that both 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is true and 'Sue was at the wedding' is true. However, this does not necessarily mean that 'Mary was at the wedding' is true. It is possible that Sue was at the wedding for some other reason, not because Mary was there. Therefore, we cannot conclude that 'Mary was at the wedding' is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
