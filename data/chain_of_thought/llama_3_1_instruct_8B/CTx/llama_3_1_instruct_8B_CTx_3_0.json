This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the splat was morphed' and Q is 'the splat quanked'. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if P is true, then Q must be true. However, if P is false, we cannot conclude anything about Q. This is because the statement only guarantees the relationship between P and Q when P is true, not when P is false.\n\nIn this case, the given statement does not provide any information about what happens when the splat was not morphed. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: no",
