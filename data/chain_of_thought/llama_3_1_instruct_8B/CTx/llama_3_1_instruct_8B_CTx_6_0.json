            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If A, then B'. \n\nIn this case, A is 'the grommet was sploffed' and B is 'the grommet plopped the frink'. The statement implies that if A is true, then B must be true. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if B is false. It only provides a relationship between A and B, not between the negation of A and the negation of B.\n\nTo infer 'If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed', we would need a statement that explicitly states the relationship between the negation of A and the negation of B, which is not provided in the given statement. This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement, and it is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nHowever, we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement by using the principle of contrapositive inference, which states that if 'If A, then B' is true, then 'If not B, then not A' is also true. Therefore, we can infer that 'If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
