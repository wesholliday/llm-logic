            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument involving a conditional statement and its contrapositive. The original statement is 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled'. This can be represented as 'C \u2192 D', where C is the condition of the sprocket being cranked and D is the condition of the sprocket being daggled.\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement 'C \u2192 D' is '\u00acD \u2192 \u00acC', where \u00acC is the negation of C and \u00acD is the negation of D. This means that if the condition D is not met, then the condition C is also not met.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the original statement would be 'If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked'. This is because we are negating the condition D (daggled) and its negation \u00acD (not daggled), and the original statement's condition C (cranked) and its negation \u00acC (not cranked).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure of the original statement and the definition of a contrapositive, we can infer that 'If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
