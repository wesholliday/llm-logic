            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the zinger was fraggled' and Q is 'the zinger was smoogled'.\n\nIn a conditional statement, if P is true, then Q must be true. However, if P is false, we cannot conclude anything about Q. This is known as the 'non-converse' or 'contrapositive' of the conditional statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of the given statement is 'If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled'. This is because we are negating both P and Q, which is a valid logical operation.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
