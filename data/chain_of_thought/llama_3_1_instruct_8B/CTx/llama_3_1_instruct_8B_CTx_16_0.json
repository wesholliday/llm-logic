            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the sneg was crampled' and Q is 'the sneg sproted the frink'. \n\nTo infer the new statement, we need to apply the rule of contrapositive, which states that 'If P, then Q' is equivalent to 'If not Q, then not P'. In this case, we need to negate both P and Q to get the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink' is 'If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled'. This is because we have negated both P and Q: 'not crampled' (negation of P) and 'not sproted the frink' (negation of Q).\n\nTherefore, we can infer the new statement 'If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
