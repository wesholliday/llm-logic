            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the dreb was vroombed' and Q is 'the dreb was spened'. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if P is true, then Q must be true. However, if P is false, we cannot conclude anything about Q. The statement does not provide any information about what happens when P is false. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed, because the statement does not provide any information about the relationship between the negation of Q and P.\n\nAnswer: no",
