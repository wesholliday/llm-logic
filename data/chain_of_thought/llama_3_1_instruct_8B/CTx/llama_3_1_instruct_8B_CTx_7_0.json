This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the whiffle was shanked' and Q is 'the whiffle tinked'. \n\nIn a conditional statement, the truth of the conclusion (Q) depends on the truth of the premise (P). However, the given statement does not explicitly state the converse, which is 'If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked'. \n\nTo infer the converse, we need to apply the principle of contrapositive, which states that 'If P, then Q' is logically equivalent to 'If not Q, then not P'. In this case, the contrapositive of the given statement would be 'If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked'. \n\nHowever, the given statement does not explicitly state the contrapositive, but it is a valid logical inference based on the principle of contrapositive. Therefore, we can infer 'If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
