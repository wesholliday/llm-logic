            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The athlete might be unable to compete' from 'The athlete might be injured and unable to compete', let's break down the statement. The phrase 'might be injured' suggests a possibility of injury, and 'and unable to compete' is a consequence of that injury. The word 'and' is a conjunction that connects two independent clauses, indicating that both conditions must be true for the entire statement to be true. Since 'might be injured' is a condition that could be true, and 'unable to compete' is a direct consequence of that condition, we can infer that 'The athlete might be unable to compete' is a logical consequence of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
