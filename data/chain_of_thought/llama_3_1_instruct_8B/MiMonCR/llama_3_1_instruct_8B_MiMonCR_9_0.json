            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The project might require additional funding' from 'The project might be delayed and require additional funding', let's break down the statement. The phrase 'might be delayed' indicates a possibility of a delay, and 'require additional funding' is a consequence of that delay. The word 'and' is used to connect two independent clauses, making 'require additional funding' a separate idea from 'might be delayed'. However, the use of 'and' implies that both clauses are related and connected in this context. Therefore, if the project might be delayed, it is reasonable to infer that it might require additional funding as a potential consequence of the delay.\n\nAnswer: yes",
