            "content": "Explanation: To infer 'The recipe might require exotic ingredients' from 'The recipe might be complicated and require exotic ingredients', we need to analyze the given statement. The phrase 'might be complicated' is a condition that sets the stage for the rest of the statement. The phrase 'and require exotic ingredients' is a consequence of the complication. Since the statement is phrased as a conjunction, we can infer that the complication is the reason for the requirement of exotic ingredients. Therefore, if the recipe is complicated, it is likely that it requires exotic ingredients. This is a logical connection, and we can safely make this inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
