            "content": "Explanation: To infer 'The meeting might involve important decisions' from 'The meeting might be confidential and involve important decisions', we need to analyze the given statement. The phrase 'might be confidential' provides additional information about the meeting, but it doesn't directly relate to the involvement of important decisions. However, the phrase 'and involve important decisions' directly states that the meeting does indeed involve important decisions. Since the statement is structured as a compound predicate with 'and', both clauses are connected as a single statement. Therefore, we can infer that the meeting does involve important decisions, regardless of its confidentiality.\n\nAnswer: yes",
