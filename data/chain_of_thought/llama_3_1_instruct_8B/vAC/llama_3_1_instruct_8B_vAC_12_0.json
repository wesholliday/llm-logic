            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The argument is a classic example of a modus tollens argument, which is a valid form of argument. However, in this case, the argument is actually an example of a modus ponens argument, which is also a valid form of argument. \n\nIn a modus ponens argument, the first premise is 'If A, then B' and the second premise is 'A', and the conclusion is 'B'. This is exactly the form of the given argument: 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' (A -> B), 'Lucy went to the zoo' (A), and 'Joe went to the park' (B). \n\nSince the argument follows the valid form of modus ponens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
