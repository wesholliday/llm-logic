            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement, where the first premise is 'If A, then B' (If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race) and the second premise is 'B' (Chris finished the race is true). The conclusion is 'A' (Alex finished the race).\n\nIn a valid argument, the conclusion must follow logically from the premises. In this case, the first premise establishes a conditional relationship between Alex and Chris finishing the race. The second premise confirms that Chris finished the race, which is the 'B' part of the conditional statement. Since the 'B' part is true, we can logically infer that the 'A' part (Alex finished the race) must also be true, given the conditional relationship established in the first premise.\n\nThis argument follows the modus ponens rule of inference, which states that if 'If A, then B' is true and B is true, then A must be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
