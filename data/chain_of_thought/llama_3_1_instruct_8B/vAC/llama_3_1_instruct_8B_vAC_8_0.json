            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a simple conditional argument, which has the form 'If A, then B' and 'A', therefore 'B'. In this case, the first premise is 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake', which is the 'if' part, and the second premise is 'The mummy was awake', which is the 'A' part. The conclusion is 'The vampire was awake', which is the 'B' part.\n\nHowever, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The first premise only states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake, but it does not state that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake. The two statements are not equivalent, and the conclusion is an unwarranted inference.\n\nIn other words, the first premise only provides a necessary condition for the vampire to be awake (i.e., the mummy being awake), but it does not provide a sufficient condition. The mummy being awake does not necessarily mean the vampire was awake, as there could be other reasons for the vampire to be awake that are not related to the mummy's state.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
