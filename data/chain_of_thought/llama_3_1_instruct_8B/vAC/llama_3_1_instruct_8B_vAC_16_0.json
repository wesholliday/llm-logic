            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a categorical syllogism, which is a type of argument that uses categorical statements (all, some, no) to make a conclusion.\n\nThe argument is: \n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n2. The pants were denim.\n3. Therefore, the shirt was cotton.\n\nTo check for validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the first premise is a conditional statement (if-then statement), which means that if the antecedent (the shirt was cotton) is true, then the consequent (the pants were denim) must be true. However, the second premise states that the pants were denim, which is the consequent of the first premise. \n\nThe problem with this argument is that it is trying to conclude the antecedent (the shirt was cotton) based on the consequent (the pants were denim), which is not a valid logical inference. This is known as affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy in logic.\n\nIn a valid argument, the conclusion must follow logically from the premises. In this case, the conclusion does not follow logically from the premises because it is based on a fallacious inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
