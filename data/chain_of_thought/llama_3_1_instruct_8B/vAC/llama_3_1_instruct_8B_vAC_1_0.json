            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a simple conditional argument, where the conclusion is the antecedent of the first premise. \n\nThe first premise is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'. This is a conditional statement, where 'Mary was at the wedding' is the antecedent and 'Sue was at the wedding' is the consequent. \n\nThe second premise is 'Sue was at the wedding', which is the consequent of the first premise. \n\nThe conclusion is 'Mary was at the wedding', which is the antecedent of the first premise. \n\nIn a conditional argument, if the antecedent of the conditional statement is true, then the consequent must also be true. However, in this case, the consequent of the conditional statement is given as true in the second premise, but we are trying to conclude the antecedent. \n\nThis is a classic example of affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy in logic. It is not a valid form of argument because it does not logically follow from the premises to the conclusion. \n\nAnswer: no",
