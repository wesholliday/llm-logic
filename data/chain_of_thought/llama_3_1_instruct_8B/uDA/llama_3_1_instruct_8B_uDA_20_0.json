            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that the banana was not yellow, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement, \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the consequence (the banana being yellow) is also true. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the condition is false, the consequence is also false.\n\nThe second statement, \"The apple was not red,\" tells us that the condition (the apple being red) is false. \n\nNow, we need to determine if the consequence (the banana being yellow) is also false when the condition is false. The conditional statement does not provide information about what happens when the condition is false; it only tells us what happens when the condition is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the banana was not yellow based on the given statements. The banana's color is not necessarily related to the apple's color when the apple is not red.\n\nAnswer: no",
