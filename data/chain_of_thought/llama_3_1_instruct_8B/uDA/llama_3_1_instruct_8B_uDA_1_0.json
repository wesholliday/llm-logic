            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that Sue was not at the wedding, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) is also true. However, the second statement \"Mary was not at the wedding\" directly contradicts the condition in the first statement. \n\nSince the condition in the first statement is not met (Mary was not at the wedding), we cannot conclude that Sue was at the wedding based on the first statement. The first statement does not provide any information about Sue's presence at the wedding when the condition is not met. Therefore, we cannot infer that Sue was not at the wedding based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
