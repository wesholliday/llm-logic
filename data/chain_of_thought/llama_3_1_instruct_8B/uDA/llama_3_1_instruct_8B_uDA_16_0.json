            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that the pants were not denim, we need to analyze the given information. The first statement says that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. This implies a relationship between the material of the shirt and the material of the pants, but it does not provide any information about the pants' material when the shirt is not cotton. The second statement tells us that the shirt was not cotton, but it does not provide any information about the pants. \n\nHowever, we can use the first statement to infer that the pants are not denim because the shirt is not cotton. If the shirt is not cotton, then according to the first statement, the pants would not be denim. This is because the first statement establishes a conditional relationship between the shirt's material and the pants' material, and since the shirt is not cotton, the pants cannot be denim.\n\nAnswer: yes",
