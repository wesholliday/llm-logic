            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that the book is not a mystery novel, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement says that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. This is a conditional statement, where the condition is \"the book was written by James\" and the consequence is \"the book is a mystery novel.\" The second statement says that the book was not written by James. \n\nWe can use a process of elimination to determine the conclusion. Since the condition (the book was written by James) is not met, we cannot directly conclude that the book is a mystery novel based on the first statement. However, we can use the second statement to eliminate the possibility of the book being a mystery novel. If the book was not written by James, then the condition for it being a mystery novel is not met, and we cannot conclude that it is a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: yes",
