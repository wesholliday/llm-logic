            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that the truck was not blue, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement says \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the car being red) is true, then the consequence (the truck being blue) is also true. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the car is not red, the truck is not blue. The second statement says \"The car was not red.\" This statement is a fact, but it does not provide any direct information about the color of the truck.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the truck was not blue, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, and the second statement is a fact. We cannot directly apply the first statement to the second statement because the first statement only provides a relationship between the car being red and the truck being blue, not between the car not being red and the truck being blue.\n\nHowever, we can use a process of elimination to analyze the situation. If the car was not red, we cannot directly conclude that the truck was not blue based on the given statements. But we can conclude that the truck's color is not determined by the car's color in this case. The truck's color is independent of the car's color when the car is not red.\n\nAnswer: no",
