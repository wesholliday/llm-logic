            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that Jen did not watch basketball, we need to analyze the given information. The first statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequence (Jen watched basketball) is also true. However, the condition is not met in this case because the second statement \"Tom did not watch football\" indicates that the condition is false.\n\nSince the condition is false, we cannot conclude that the consequence (Jen watched basketball) is true. In fact, we cannot conclude anything about Jen's actions based on this conditional statement because the condition is not met. Therefore, we cannot infer that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
