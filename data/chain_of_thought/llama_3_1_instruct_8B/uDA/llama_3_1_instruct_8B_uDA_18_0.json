            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that the truck was not metal, we need to analyze the given information. The first statement says that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. This is a conditional statement, which means that it only provides a relationship between the two variables (doll and truck) under a specific condition (the doll being plastic). It does not provide any information about the truck's material when the doll is not plastic.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the doll was not plastic. This statement is independent of the first one and does not provide any information about the truck's material.\n\nSince the first statement only provides a relationship between the doll and truck when the doll is plastic, and the second statement tells us that the doll is not plastic, we cannot directly apply the relationship from the first statement to the second statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the material of the truck based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
