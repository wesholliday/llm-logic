            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, we need to analyze the given information. The first statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" implies a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. However, this does not directly state that Mark bought the blue shirt if Lisa did not buy the red shirt. The second statement \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" is a fact, but it does not provide any information about Mark's purchase. \n\nSince the conditional statement only talks about the relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt, and we know Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we cannot directly infer that Mark bought the blue shirt. However, we also cannot directly infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt because the conditional statement does not cover the scenario where Lisa does not buy the red shirt. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive conclusion about Mark's purchase based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
