The first statement says that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. This is a conditional statement, which means that it only establishes a relationship between the two events (Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo) under a specific condition (Joe going to the park). The second statement says that Joe did not go to the park. \n\nSince the condition (Joe going to the park) is not met, we cannot directly apply the relationship established in the first statement to the second statement. The first statement does not provide any information about what Lucy does when Joe does not go to the park. Therefore, we cannot infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
