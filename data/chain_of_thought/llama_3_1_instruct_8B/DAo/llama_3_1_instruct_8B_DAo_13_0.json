            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The truck was not blue', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'The car was not red'. This statement provides information about the color of the car, but it does not provide any information about the color of the truck. The second statement is 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'. This statement provides a conditional relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck. However, it does not provide any information about the color of the car or the truck when the car is not red.\n\nTo infer 'The truck was not blue', we need to find a connection between the given statements and the statement we want to infer. Since the first statement does not provide any information about the truck, we cannot directly infer the color of the truck from it. However, the second statement provides a conditional relationship that can be used to infer the color of the truck if we know the color of the car. \n\nSince we know the car was not red from the first statement, we can use the second statement to infer that the truck was not blue. This is because the second statement only provides a condition for when the car is red, and since the car is not red, the condition is not met, and we cannot infer the color of the truck from this condition. However, we can use the fact that the car is not red to infer that the truck is not blue because if the car were red, the truck would be blue, but since the car is not red, the truck is not blue.\n\nAnswer: yes",
