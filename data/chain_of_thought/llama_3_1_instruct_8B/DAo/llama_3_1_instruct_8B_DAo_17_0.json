The first statement is 'Ben did not eat pasta'. The second statement is 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad'. \n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Ben did not eat pasta. The second statement provides a conditional relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating salad. It does not provide any information about what happens if Ben does not eat pasta. \n\nTo infer 'Kate did not eat salad', we would need to know that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad. However, the given statements do not provide this information. They only provide a relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating salad, not the reverse relationship.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Kate did not eat salad' based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
