            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The unicorn was not in the forest', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'The griffin was not in the forest', which directly tells us the griffin's location. The second statement is 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest', which is a conditional statement. This statement implies that the presence of the griffin in the forest is a sufficient condition for the unicorn to be in the forest.\n\nTo infer 'The unicorn was not in the forest', we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. Since the first statement tells us the griffin is not in the forest, we can use this information to evaluate the second statement. If the griffin is not in the forest, then the condition for the unicorn to be in the forest (i.e., the griffin being in the forest) is not met. Therefore, we can conclude that the unicorn was not in the forest because the condition for it to be in the forest (the griffin being in the forest) is not satisfied.\n\nAnswer: yes",
