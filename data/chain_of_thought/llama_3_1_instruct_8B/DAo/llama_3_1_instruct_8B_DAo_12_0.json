            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Lucy did not go to the zoo', we need to analyze the given statements and their logical implications. The first statement is 'Joe did not go to the park'. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'. This means that if the condition (Joe went to the park) is not met, we cannot directly infer anything about Lucy's actions. However, since we know Joe did not go to the park, we can use the second statement to infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo, because the condition (Joe going to the park) is not met.\n\nAnswer: yes",
