            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The pants were not denim', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'The shirt was not cotton'. This statement directly tells us the material of the shirt, but it doesn't provide any information about the pants. The second statement is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'. This statement provides a conditional relationship between the material of the shirt and the material of the pants. \n\nHowever, the first statement does not provide any information about the material of the shirt being cotton or not. It only states that the shirt is not cotton. Therefore, the conditional statement in the second statement is not triggered because the shirt is not cotton. The conditional statement does not provide any information about the pants when the shirt is not cotton. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the material of the pants from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
