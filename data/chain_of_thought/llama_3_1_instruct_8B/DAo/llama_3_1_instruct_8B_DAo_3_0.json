            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The book is not a mystery novel', we need to analyze the given statements and apply the rules of logical reasoning. \n\nThe first statement is 'The book was not written by James'. This statement directly tells us the authorship of the book, which is not James.\n\nThe second statement is 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel'. This statement is a conditional statement, which means it provides a condition (the book being written by James) and a consequence (the book being a mystery novel). \n\nTo apply the rules of logical reasoning, we can use the process of modus tollens. Modus tollens is a rule that states: if P implies Q, and not P, then not Q. In this case, P is 'The book was written by James', and Q is 'The book is a mystery novel'.\n\nGiven the first statement 'The book was not written by James', we can apply modus tollens to conclude that 'The book is not a mystery novel'. This is because the condition (the book being written by James) is not met, and therefore, the consequence (the book being a mystery novel) cannot be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
