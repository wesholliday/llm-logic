            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Sue was not at the wedding', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'Mary was not at the wedding'. The second statement is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) is also true.\n\nHowever, we are given that the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is not true, as stated in the first statement. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Sue was at the wedding, because the condition for Sue's presence (Mary being at the wedding) is not met.\n\nHowever, we can conclude that we cannot infer 'Sue was at the wedding' from the given statements. But we can infer 'Sue was not at the wedding' because if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would have been at the wedding, but since Mary was not at the wedding, it is possible that Sue was not at the wedding. This is a form of modus tollens, a valid form of logical argument.\n\nAnswer: yes",
