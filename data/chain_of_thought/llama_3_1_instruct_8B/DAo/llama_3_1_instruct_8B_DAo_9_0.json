            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt', which provides information about Lisa's action but does not directly relate to Mark's action. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'. This statement implies a relationship between Lisa's action and Mark's action, but it does not provide information about what happens when Lisa does not buy the red shirt.\n\nTo infer 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt', we need to know that Lisa did not buy the red shirt and that if Lisa had bought the red shirt, Mark would have bought the blue shirt. However, we do not have any information about what happens when Lisa does not buy the red shirt. Therefore, we cannot be certain about Mark's action in this scenario.\n\nHowever, we can use a process of elimination to infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. If Mark had bought the blue shirt, then the conditional statement would be true regardless of whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not. But since we know that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, and the conditional statement is true, it implies that Mark must not have bought the blue shirt, because if he had, the conditional statement would be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
