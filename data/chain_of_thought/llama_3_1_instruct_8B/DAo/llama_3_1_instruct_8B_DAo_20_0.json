            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The banana was not yellow' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements and apply the rules of logical inference.\n\nThe first statement is 'The apple was not red'. This statement directly provides information about the color of the apple.\n\nThe second statement is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'. This statement is a conditional statement, which means it establishes a relationship between two conditions: the apple being red and the banana being yellow. It does not directly provide information about the color of the banana.\n\nTo infer 'The banana was not yellow', we need to use the first statement and the second statement together. We can do this by applying the rule of modus tollens, which is a form of logical inference. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement 'If A, then B' and we know that 'not B', then we can infer 'not A'.\n\nIn this case, we can rewrite the second statement as 'If the apple is red, then the banana is yellow'. We know that 'The apple was not red' (from the first statement), which is equivalent to 'not A' in the conditional statement. Using modus tollens, we can infer that 'not B', which means 'The banana was not yellow'.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer 'The banana was not yellow' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
