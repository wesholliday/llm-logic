            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The truck was not metal', we need to analyze the given statements and apply logical reasoning. \n\nFirst, we have 'The doll was not plastic'. This statement directly tells us the material of the doll, which is not plastic.\n\nThe second statement is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'. This is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (the doll being plastic) is true, then the consequence (the truck being metal) follows. However, this statement does not directly tell us the material of the truck.\n\nTo infer 'The truck was not metal', we need to find a connection between the two statements. Since the first statement tells us the doll is not plastic, we can use this information to evaluate the conditional statement. If the doll is not plastic, then the condition of the conditional statement is not met.\n\nUsing the principle of contrapositive, we can infer that if the doll is not plastic, then the truck is not necessarily metal. However, we cannot directly conclude that the truck is not metal. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if the doll is plastic, not what happens if the doll is not plastic.\n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer 'The truck was not metal' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
