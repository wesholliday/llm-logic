            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The mummy was not awake', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'The vampire was not awake'. This statement directly tells us the state of the vampire, which is that it is not awake. The second statement is 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the vampire being awake) is true, then the consequence (the mummy being awake) is also true. However, this statement does not directly tell us the state of the mummy when the vampire is not awake.\n\nTo infer the state of the mummy, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. The first statement tells us that the vampire is not awake, and the second statement tells us that if the vampire were awake, the mummy would be awake. Since the vampire is not awake, the condition of the second statement is not met, and we cannot conclude that the mummy is awake based on the second statement. However, we can conclude that the mummy's state is not dependent on the vampire's state when the vampire is not awake. Therefore, we cannot directly infer the state of the mummy from the given statements.\n\nHowever, we can use the first statement to infer the state of the mummy. Since the first statement directly tells us that the vampire is not awake, and there is no information that suggests the mummy's state is dependent on the vampire's state when the vampire is not awake, we can conclude that the mummy's state is not dependent on the vampire's state in this case. Therefore, we can infer that the mummy was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
