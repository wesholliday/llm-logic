The first statement 'Sam did not take a plane' provides information about Sam's mode of transportation but does not provide any information about Erin's mode of transportation. The second statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' is a conditional statement that links Sam's mode of transportation to Erin's mode of transportation. However, this statement does not provide any information about what happens if Sam does not take a plane. \n\nSince we do not have any information about what happens when Sam does not take a plane, we cannot directly infer Erin's mode of transportation from the given statements. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Erin did not take a train.\n\nAnswer: no",
