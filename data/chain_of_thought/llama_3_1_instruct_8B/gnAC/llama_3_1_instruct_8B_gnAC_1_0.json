            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument involving the concept of modus ponens and the principle of contrapositive inference. The given statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement, which can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is 'Mary was at the wedding' and Q is 'Sue was at the wedding'. \n\nThe statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' being true means that P \u2192 Q is true. The statement 'Sue was at the wedding' being true means that Q is true. \n\nHowever, the truth of Q (Sue was at the wedding) does not necessarily imply the truth of P (Mary was at the wedding). This is because there could be other reasons why Sue was at the wedding, not necessarily because Mary was there. \n\nFor example, Sue might have been invited separately, or she might have been a member of the wedding party. Therefore, the truth of the conditional statement P \u2192 Q and the truth of Q do not logically guarantee the truth of P.\n\nAnswer: no",
