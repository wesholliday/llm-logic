            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the conclusion 'The vampire was awake' necessarily follows from the given premises, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first premise 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is a conditional statement, which can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is 'the vampire was awake' and Q is 'the mummy was awake'. The second premise 'The mummy was awake' is a simple statement that asserts the truth of Q.\n\nGiven that Q is true, we can use the definition of a conditional statement to infer that P must also be true. This is because a conditional statement P \u2192 Q is equivalent to 'not P or Q', and if Q is true, then 'not P or Q' is true only if P is true. Therefore, if the mummy was awake, it necessarily follows that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
