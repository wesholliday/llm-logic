            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The splat is morphed', let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. 'It's not the case that the splat must be quanked' can be rewritten as 'The splat is not necessarily quanked'. This statement tells us that the splat does not have to be quanked, but it does not rule out the possibility of it being quanked.\n\n2. 'Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed' is a disjunction statement. This means that at least one of the two conditions (the splat must be quanked or it is morphed) must be true. However, it does not necessarily mean that both conditions are true.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n- If the splat is quanked, then the first statement ('It's not the case that the splat must be quanked') is false, which contradicts the second statement. Therefore, the splat cannot be quanked.\n\n- Since the splat cannot be quanked, the second statement ('Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed') implies that the splat must be morphed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'The splat is morphed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
