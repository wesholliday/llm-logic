            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is in the past tense, indicating that the application has already been completed. The use of the past tense suggests that the action has occurred and is no longer ongoing. The phrase 'must have been completed' implies a level of certainty or necessity, but it still refers to a past action. The second part of the statement, 'included references', is also in the past tense and is directly connected to the first part with 'and'. This suggests that the two actions are being presented as a single, completed event. Therefore, we can infer that the application was indeed completed online and included references, as the statement is presented in a way that implies a completed action.\n\nAnswer: yes",
