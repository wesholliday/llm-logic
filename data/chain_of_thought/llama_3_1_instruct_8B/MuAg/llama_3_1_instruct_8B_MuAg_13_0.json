            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is a conjunction of two conditions: 'The movie must have been in English' and 'it must have had subtitles'. The word 'it' in the second condition refers back to 'the movie', which is the subject of the first condition. This creates a clear connection between the two conditions. However, the word 'it' is not necessary to express the second condition, as the subject 'the movie' can be repeated. Therefore, the original statement can be simplified to 'The movie must have been in English and had subtitles', which is logically equivalent to the original statement. This is an example of a process called 'ellipsis', where a word or phrase is omitted without changing the meaning of the sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
