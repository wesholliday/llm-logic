            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The document must have been signed and notarized' from 'The document must have been signed and it must have been notarized', we need to analyze the logical structure of the two statements. \n\nThe original statement is a compound sentence with two independent clauses joined by 'and'. Each clause is a separate requirement for the document. The word 'it' in the second clause refers back to the document, making it clear that the notarization is also a requirement for the document.\n\nIn this case, the word 'it' is a pronoun that replaces the subject 'document', making the two clauses closely related. The use of 'and' between the two clauses indicates that both conditions must be met, and the word 'it' clarifies that the notarization is a separate requirement for the same document.\n\nTherefore, the two statements are logically equivalent, and we can infer 'The document must have been signed and notarized' from 'The document must have been signed and it must have been notarized'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
