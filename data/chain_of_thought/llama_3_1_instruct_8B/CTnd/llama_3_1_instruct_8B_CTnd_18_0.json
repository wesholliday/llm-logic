            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth'. This statement is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the issue was discussed' and Q is 'it was not discussed in depth'. \n\nThe given statement does not provide any information about the depth of the discussion when the issue was discussed. It only states that if the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth. This implies that the depth of the discussion is the opposite of what we would expect if the issue was discussed. However, it does not provide any information about the depth of the discussion when the issue was not discussed.\n\nTo infer 'If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed', we would need to know that the issue was not discussed when it was not discussed in depth. But the given statement does not provide this information. Therefore, we cannot logically infer 'If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
