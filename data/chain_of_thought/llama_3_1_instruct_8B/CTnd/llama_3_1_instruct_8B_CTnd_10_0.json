Modus tollens is a rule that states: \n\nIf P, then Q\nNot Q\n\u2234 Not P\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nIf advice was offered, then it was helpful advice (P \u2192 Q)\nAdvice was not helpful (Not Q)\n\u2234 Advice was not offered (Not P)\n\nHowever, the original statement is 'If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice', which is equivalent to 'If advice was offered, then it was not helpful advice' (P \u2192 Not Q). \n\nTo infer 'If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered', we need to negate the original statement and swap the positions of the hypotheses. The negation of the original statement is 'If advice was offered, then it was helpful advice' (P \u2192 Q). \n\nNow, if we swap the positions of the hypotheses, we get 'If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered'. However, this is not a valid inference from the original statement. The original statement does not provide any information about the relationship between helpful advice and advice not being offered. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered' from the original statement.",
