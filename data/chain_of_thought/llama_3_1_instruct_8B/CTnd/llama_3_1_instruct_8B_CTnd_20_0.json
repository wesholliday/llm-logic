            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made', we need to analyze the given statement 'If a recommendation was made, then it was not a strong recommendation'. This statement is in the form of a conditional statement, where 'if a recommendation was made' is the antecedent (or condition) and 'it was not a strong recommendation' is the consequent (or result).\n\nThe given statement implies that whenever a recommendation is made, it is not a strong recommendation. This means that the condition of a recommendation being made is always associated with the result of it not being a strong recommendation.\n\nNow, we want to infer 'If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made'. This is also a conditional statement, but the consequent is the opposite of the original statement. \n\nTo determine if we can infer this, we need to check if the original statement implies the negation of the consequent of the new statement. In other words, we need to check if the original statement implies 'a recommendation was made' whenever a strong recommendation is made.\n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide any information about what happens when a strong recommendation is made. It only talks about the case when a recommendation is made, not when a strong recommendation is made. Therefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
