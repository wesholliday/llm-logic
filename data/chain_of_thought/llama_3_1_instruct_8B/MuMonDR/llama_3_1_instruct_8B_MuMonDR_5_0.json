The statement 'The package must have been delivered today' implies that the package was delivered on the current day. However, it does not provide any information about the package being delivered on the next day. \n\nThe statement does not exclude the possibility of the package being delivered today, but it also does not include the possibility of it being delivered tomorrow. Therefore, we cannot infer that the package must have been delivered tomorrow or today, as the statement only confirms delivery on the current day.\n\nAnswer: no",
