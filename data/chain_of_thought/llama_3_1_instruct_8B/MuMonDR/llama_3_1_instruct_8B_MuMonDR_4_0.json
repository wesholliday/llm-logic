            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The meeting must have been scheduled for 2 PM' implies that the meeting indeed took place at 2 PM. However, the statement does not provide any information about whether the meeting was cancelled or not. It only specifies the time it was scheduled for. Therefore, we cannot infer that the meeting must have been cancelled, as the statement does not mention cancellation. The correct inference would be that the meeting was indeed scheduled for 2 PM, but we cannot determine if it was actually held or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
