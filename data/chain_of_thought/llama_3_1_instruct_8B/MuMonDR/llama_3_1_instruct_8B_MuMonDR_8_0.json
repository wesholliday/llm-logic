This statement implies that the restaurant was not open on Mondays, but it doesn't provide any information about the restaurant's operating hours on other days of the week. It doesn't mention anything about the restaurant being open for limited hours, only that it was closed on Mondays. Therefore, we can't infer that the restaurant was open for limited hours on other days, as that information is not provided. However, we can infer that the restaurant was closed on Mondays, which is the only specific information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
