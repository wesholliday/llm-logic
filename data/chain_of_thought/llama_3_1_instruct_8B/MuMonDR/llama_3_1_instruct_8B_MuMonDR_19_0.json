            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The application must have been completed in person or online', we need to analyze the given statement 'The application must have been completed online'. This statement explicitly states that the application was completed online, which implies that it was not completed in any other way. The word 'must' is a modal verb that indicates a necessity or requirement, and 'completed online' is the specific condition that meets this requirement.\n\nSince the statement does not mention any other method of completion, such as in person, we cannot infer that the application was completed in person. The statement only provides information about the online completion, and there is no evidence to suggest that any other method was used.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The application must have been completed in person or online' because the original statement only specifies online completion, and does not provide any information about in-person completion.\n\nAnswer: no",
