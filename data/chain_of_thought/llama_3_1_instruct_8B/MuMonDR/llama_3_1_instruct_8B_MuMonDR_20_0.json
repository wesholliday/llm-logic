            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The event must have been formal' implies that the event has a specific level of formality, which is at the higher end of the formality spectrum. This means that the event is not casual or informal. However, it does not necessarily exclude the possibility of the event being semi-formal, as semi-formal events can also be considered formal in a broader sense. The key point is that the event is not informal, but it does not provide enough information to rule out semi-formal events entirely. Therefore, we can infer that the event must have been at least semi-formal or formal, but not necessarily one or the other.\n\nAnswer: yes",
