            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The movie must have been in English' implies that the movie was either spoken in the English language or it was in a language that was translated into English, which could be through subtitles. This is because the statement does not specify whether the movie was spoken in English or if it was subtitled in English. However, it does imply that the movie was accessible to English speakers, either through spoken language or through subtitles. Therefore, we can infer that the movie must have been subtitled or in English, as it is the only two possible scenarios that would make the statement true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
