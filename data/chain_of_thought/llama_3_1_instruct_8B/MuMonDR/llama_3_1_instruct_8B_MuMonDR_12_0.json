            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The project must have been completed by Friday' implies that the project was finished on or before Friday. This is because the word 'by' typically indicates a deadline or a time limit, and in this context, it suggests that the project was completed before or on the specified date. \n\nHowever, the statement does not provide any information about whether the project was extended or not. An extension would imply that the project was initially set to be completed on a different date, but it was extended to a later date, which is not mentioned in the given statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that the project must have been extended or completed by Friday.\n\nAnswer: no",
