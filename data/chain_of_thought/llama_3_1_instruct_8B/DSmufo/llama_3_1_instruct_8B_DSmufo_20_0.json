            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The sunglasses are in her bag', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head' implies that the sunglasses are not necessarily on her head. The second statement 'Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag' presents a disjunction, meaning that the sunglasses are either on her head or in her bag, but not both. \n\nSince the first statement tells us that the sunglasses are not necessarily on her head, we can conclude that the second option in the disjunction (they are in her bag) is the only possible option left. This is because if the sunglasses were not on her head, the only other option is that they are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
