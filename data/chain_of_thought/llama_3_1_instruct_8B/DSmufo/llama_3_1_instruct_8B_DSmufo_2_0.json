            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The book is on the shelf', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table' implies that the book is not necessarily resting on the table. The second statement 'Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf' presents a disjunction, which means that at least one of the options must be true. \n\nGiven that the first statement rules out the possibility of the book being on the table, we are left with the second option, which is 'it is on the shelf'. This is because if the book is not on the table, the only other option left in the disjunction is that it is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
