            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The document might be signed' implies that the document has the potential to be signed, but it does not provide any information about whether the document has been notarized or not. Notarization is a separate process that involves verifying the identity of the person signing the document and confirming that they are signing voluntarily. The fact that a document might be signed does not necessarily mean it has been notarized. Therefore, we cannot infer that the document might be signed and notarized based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
