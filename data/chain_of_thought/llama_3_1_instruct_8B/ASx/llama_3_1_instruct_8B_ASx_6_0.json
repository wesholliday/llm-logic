This statement implies a cause-and-effect relationship between the action of 'you glurp' and the consequence of 'it will hurt my snarfs'. \n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide any information about the condition or state of the speaker (I) when the action of 'you glurp' occurs. The statement does not mention any additional factors that could influence the outcome, such as wearing plorks. \n\nIn order to infer the new statement, we would need additional information that links wearing plorks to the outcome of 'it will hurt my snarfs' when 'you glurp'. Since the original statement does not provide this information, we cannot logically infer the new statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
