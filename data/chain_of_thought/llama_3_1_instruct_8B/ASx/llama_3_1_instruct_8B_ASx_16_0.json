The original statement is in the form of a conditional statement: 'If A, then B'. In this case, 'A' is 'the trankle is sploofed' and 'B' is 'the zorple will quibble'. \n\nHowever, the new statement adds an additional condition 'the drib is flanked'. To infer the new statement, we need to know if the addition of this new condition is logically related to the original condition 'the trankle is sploofed'. \n\nIn the original statement, there is no logical connection between 'the trankle is sploofed' and 'the drib is flanked'. The two conditions are unrelated, and the original statement does not provide any information about the relationship between 'the trankle is sploofed' and 'the drib is flanked'. \n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the new statement from the original statement because the addition of 'the drib is flanked' is not supported by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
