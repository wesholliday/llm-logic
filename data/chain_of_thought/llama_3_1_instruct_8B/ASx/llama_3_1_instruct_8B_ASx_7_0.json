            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the given statement, we need to analyze the original statement and the new statement. The original statement is 'If the tizzer is on, then the goom is snurpled.' This is a conditional statement where the condition is 'the tizzer is on' and the consequence is 'the goom is snurpled.'\n\nThe new statement is 'If the tizzer is on and the plink light is out, then the goom is snurpled.' This statement adds an additional condition 'the plink light is out' to the original condition 'the tizzer is on.'\n\nTo infer the new statement from the original statement, we need to determine if the additional condition 'the plink light is out' affects the consequence 'the goom is snurpled.' If the original statement implies that the goom is snurpled regardless of the plink light's state, then we can infer the new statement.\n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide any information about the plink light. It only states that the goom is snurpled when the tizzer is on. Therefore, we cannot infer that the goom is snurpled when the tizzer is on and the plink light is out, as the original statement does not account for the plink light's state.\n\nAnswer: no",
