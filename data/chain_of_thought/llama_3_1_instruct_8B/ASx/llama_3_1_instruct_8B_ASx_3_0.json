The original statement is in the form of 'If A, then B', where A is 'the fribble is in the snarp' and B is 'it is flugged'. \n\nThe new statement we want to infer is also in the form of 'If A and C, then B', where A is 'the fribble is in the snarp', C is 'the snarp is flooping', and B is 'it is flugged'. \n\nIn order to infer the new statement from the original statement, we need to know that the addition of 'the snarp is flooping' (C) does not affect the relationship between A and B. In other words, we need to know that 'the snarp is flooping' is not relevant to the relationship between 'the fribble is in the snarp' and 'it is flugged'.\n\nHowever, we cannot determine this from the original statement. The original statement does not provide any information about the relationship between 'the snarp is flooping' and 'it is flugged'. Therefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
