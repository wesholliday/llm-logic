The original statement is 'If we crink the snoogle, then we'll plook a nurp'. This is a conditional statement where 'crink the snoogle' is the condition and 'plook a nurp' is the consequence.\n\nThe new statement is 'If we crink the snoogle and a wug zites, then we'll plook a nurp'. This statement adds an additional condition 'a wug zites' to the original condition 'crink the snoogle'. \n\nIn order to infer the new statement from the original statement, we need to know that 'a wug zites' is a necessary condition for 'crink the snoogle' to happen. However, the original statement does not provide any information about the relationship between 'crink the snoogle' and 'a wug zites'. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original statement because we do not have enough information to establish the necessary relationship between 'crink the snoogle' and 'a wug zites'.\n\nAnswer: no",
