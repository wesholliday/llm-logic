The original statement is in the form of 'If A, then B', where A is 'the glunk snarbles' and B is 'the blip will be floinked'. \n\nIn order to infer the new statement, we need to see if the addition of the condition 'the troon is zibbled' to the original condition 'the glunk snarbles' would still lead to the conclusion 'the blip will be floinked'. \n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide any information about the relationship between 'the glunk snarbles' and 'the troon is zibbled'. It only establishes a direct relationship between 'the glunk snarbles' and 'the blip will be floinked'. Therefore, we cannot infer that the addition of 'the troon is zibbled' would still lead to the conclusion 'the blip will be floinked'.\n\nAnswer: no",
