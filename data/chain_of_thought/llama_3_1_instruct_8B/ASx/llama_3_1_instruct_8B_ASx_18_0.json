The original statement is in the form of 'If A, then B', where A is 'the zonk is twiddled' and B is 'it will pluzzle'. \n\nThe new statement adds an additional condition 'it is blorped' to the original condition 'the zonk is twiddled'. This new condition is not present in the original statement. In order to infer the new statement from the original one, we need to know that 'it is blorped' is either a necessary or sufficient condition for 'the zonk is twiddled'. However, we do not have any information about the relationship between 'it is blorped' and 'the zonk is twiddled' in the original statement.\n\nSince we do not have any information about the relationship between 'it is blorped' and 'the zonk is twiddled', we cannot infer that 'it is blorped' is a necessary or sufficient condition for 'the zonk is twiddled'. Therefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: no",
