'It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table' implies that the book is not necessarily resting on the table. This statement does not provide any information about the book's location, but it rules out the possibility that the book must be on the table.\n\n2. 'Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table' presents two possibilities for the book's location: either it's on the shelf or it's on the table. This statement implies that these are the only two possible locations for the book.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the book is not necessarily on the table, we can conclude that the book must be on the shelf. This is because the only other option is the table, which we've ruled out.\n\nAnswer: yes",
