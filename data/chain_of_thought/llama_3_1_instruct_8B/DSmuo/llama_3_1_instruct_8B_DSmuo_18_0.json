            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The notebook is in the drawer', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand' implies that the notebook is not necessarily on the nightstand. The second statement 'Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand' presents a disjunction, meaning the notebook is either in the drawer or it has to be on the nightstand, but not both. \n\nGiven that the first statement rules out the necessity of the notebook being on the nightstand, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer because the second statement does not provide any other option for the notebook's location. The disjunction in the second statement implies that if the notebook is not on the nightstand, it must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
