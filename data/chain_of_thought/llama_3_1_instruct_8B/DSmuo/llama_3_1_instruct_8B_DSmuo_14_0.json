            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The milk is on the counter', let's break down the given statements. \n\n1. 'It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge' implies that the milk is not necessarily in the fridge. This statement does not provide any information about the milk's current location, but it rules out the possibility that the milk must be in the fridge.\n\n2. 'Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge' presents two possibilities for the milk's location: it can either be on the counter or in the fridge. However, this statement also implies that if the milk is not in the fridge, it must be on the counter.\n\nConsidering both statements together, we can conclude that the milk is either on the counter or in the fridge. However, the first statement tells us that the milk is not necessarily in the fridge. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
