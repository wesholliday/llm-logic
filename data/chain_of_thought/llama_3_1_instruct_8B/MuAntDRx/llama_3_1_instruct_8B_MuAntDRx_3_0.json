This statement is a disjunction, which means it presents two possibilities: either the floob is in the bimboozle or it is on the quibble. \n\nIn a disjunction, both options are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and it's possible for both conditions to be true at the same time. However, the statement does not provide any information that would suggest the floob cannot be in the bimboozle and on the quibble simultaneously. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the floob must be on the quibble exclusively, as the statement does not rule out the possibility of the floob being in the bimboozle.\n\nAnswer: no",
