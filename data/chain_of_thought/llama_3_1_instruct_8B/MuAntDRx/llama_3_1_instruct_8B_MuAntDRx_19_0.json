This statement presents two options for the state of the flibbit: it must be either 'zibble wozzle' or 'in plonk'. The use of 'or' indicates that these are mutually exclusive possibilities, meaning the flibbit cannot be both 'zibble wozzle' and 'in plonk' at the same time. However, it does not exclude the possibility that the flibbit could be 'in plonk'. \n\nIn fact, the statement does not provide any information that would contradict the possibility of the flibbit being 'in plonk'. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The flibbit must be in plonk' is a valid conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
