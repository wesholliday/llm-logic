            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument involving modus ponens, which is a form of deductive reasoning. Modus ponens is a rule of inference that states: if P \u2192 Q and P, then Q. In this case, 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is the conditional statement (P \u2192 Q), and 'Sue was at the wedding' is the premise (P). We are trying to conclude 'Mary was at the wedding' (Q).\n\nTo apply modus ponens, we need to check if the conditional statement is true and if the premise is true. If both conditions are met, then we can conclude the conclusion. In this case, the conditional statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is true, and the premise 'Sue was at the wedding' is also true. Therefore, we can apply modus ponens to conclude that 'Mary was at the wedding' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
