            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The sprocket is cranked', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'The sprocket is not daggled', which is a direct negation of the state of the sprocket. The second statement is 'Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked', which is a disjunction (or statement) that covers two possible states of the sprocket.\n\nGiven that the sprocket is not daggled, we can eliminate the 'daggled' option from the disjunction. This leaves us with the 'or' part of the statement, which is 'it is cranked'. Since the sprocket cannot be both daggled and not daggled at the same time, and we have eliminated the 'daggled' option, we can conclude that the sprocket must be cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
