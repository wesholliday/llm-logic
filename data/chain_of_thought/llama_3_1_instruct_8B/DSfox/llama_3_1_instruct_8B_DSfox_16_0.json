This statement tells us that the sneg is not in the state of being sproted. The second statement is 'Either the sneg is sproted or it is crampled'. This is a disjunction, meaning it is one of the two options that is true. \n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the sneg is not sproted. Since the second statement is a disjunction, and we know one of the options is false (the sneg is not sproted), the other option must be true. Therefore, the only option left is that the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
