            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The car was not red' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' is a conditional statement. It implies that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. The second statement 'The truck was not blue' is a simple statement that contradicts the conclusion of the first statement.\n\nTo infer 'The car was not red', we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. Since the first statement is a conditional, we can use the contrapositive of the first statement, which is 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red'. This is because the contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'.\n\nNow, we can combine the contrapositive with the second statement 'The truck was not blue'. Since the contrapositive and the second statement are both true, we can conclude that 'The car was not red'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
