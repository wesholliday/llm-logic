            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The vampire was not awake', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is a conditional statement. It implies that if the vampire is awake, the mummy is also awake. The second statement 'The mummy was not awake' is a simple statement that directly contradicts the conclusion of the first statement.\n\nTo infer 'The vampire was not awake', we need to use the first statement as a basis for our reasoning. If the mummy was not awake, it directly contradicts the conclusion of the first statement, which states that if the vampire is awake, the mummy is also awake. This means that the condition 'the vampire was awake' must be false, because if it were true, the mummy would be awake, but we know the mummy is not awake.\n\nTherefore, we can logically conclude that 'The vampire was not awake' because the condition that would make the mummy awake is not met.\n\nAnswer: yes",
