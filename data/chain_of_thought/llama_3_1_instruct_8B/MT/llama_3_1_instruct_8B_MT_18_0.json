            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The doll was not plastic', we need to analyze the given statements and their logical connections. \n\nThe first statement is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'. This is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (the doll being plastic) is true, then the consequence (the truck being metal) must also be true. However, it does not directly state that the doll is plastic or the truck is metal.\n\nThe second statement is 'The truck was not metal'. This statement directly contradicts the consequence of the first statement, which implies that the truck is metal. \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that the doll is not plastic. To do this, we need to see if the truth of the second statement (the truck is not metal) affects the truth of the first statement (if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal). \n\nSince the truck is not metal, it means the condition in the first statement (the doll being plastic) cannot be true, because if it were true, the consequence (the truck being metal) would also be true, which contradicts the second statement. Therefore, we can infer that the doll is not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
