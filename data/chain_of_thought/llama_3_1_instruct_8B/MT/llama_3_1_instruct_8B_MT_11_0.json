            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The cake was not chocolate', we need to analyze the given statements and their logical connections. The first statement is 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry'. This is a conditional statement, where the condition is 'the cake was chocolate' and the consequence is 'the muffins were blueberry'. The second statement is 'The muffins were not blueberry'. \n\nTo infer 'The cake was not chocolate', we need to find a logical connection between the given statements. If the muffins were not blueberry, it contradicts the consequence of the first statement, which is that the muffins would be blueberry if the cake was chocolate. This means that the condition 'the cake was chocolate' must be false, because if it were true, the consequence 'the muffins were blueberry' would also be true, but we know that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nAnswer: yes",
