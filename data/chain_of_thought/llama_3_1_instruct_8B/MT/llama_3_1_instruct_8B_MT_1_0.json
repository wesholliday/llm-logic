            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Mary was not at the wedding', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true. However, the second statement 'Sue was not at the wedding' directly contradicts the consequence of the first statement. \n\nIn logic, when a conditional statement is given and its consequence is false, we can conclude that the condition must also be false. This is known as modus tollens, a rule of inference in logic. Therefore, since the consequence (Sue was at the wedding) is false, we can infer that the condition (Mary was at the wedding) must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
