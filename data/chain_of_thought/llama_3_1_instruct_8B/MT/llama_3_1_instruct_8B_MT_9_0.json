            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the consequence (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true. However, the second statement 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt' contradicts the consequence of the first statement. \n\nSince the consequence of the first statement is not true (Mark did not buy the blue shirt), we cannot conclude that the condition of the first statement is true. In other words, we cannot be certain that Lisa bought the red shirt. Therefore, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
