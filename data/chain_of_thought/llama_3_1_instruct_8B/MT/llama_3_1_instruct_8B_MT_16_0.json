            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The shirt was not cotton', we need to analyze the given statements and their logical connections. \n\nThe first statement is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'. This is a conditional statement, where the condition is 'the shirt was cotton' and the consequence is 'the pants were denim'. \n\nThe second statement is 'The pants were not denim'. \n\nTo infer 'The shirt was not cotton', we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. If the pants were not denim, it contradicts the consequence of the first statement, which is that the pants would be denim if the shirt was cotton. \n\nThis contradiction suggests that the condition 'the shirt was cotton' must be false, because if it were true, the pants would be denim, but they are not. Therefore, we can logically conclude that 'The shirt was not cotton'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
