            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The book was not written by James', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' is a conditional statement. It implies that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. The second statement 'The book is not a mystery novel' is a simple statement that contradicts the conclusion of the first statement.\n\nUsing the process of elimination, we can conclude that the book was not written by James because if it was, it would be a mystery novel, but it is not. This is a classic example of a modus tollens argument, where we have:\n\n1. If A (book was written by James), then B (book is a mystery novel)\n2. Not B (book is not a mystery novel)\n3. Therefore, Not A (book was not written by James)\n\nAnswer: yes",
