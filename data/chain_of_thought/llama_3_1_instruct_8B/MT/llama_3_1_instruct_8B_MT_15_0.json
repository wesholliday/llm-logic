            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Sam did not take a plane', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (Sam took a plane) is true, then the consequence (Erin took a train) must also be true. The second statement 'Erin did not take a train' is a fact that contradicts the consequence of the first statement. \n\nSince the consequence of the first statement is not true (Erin did not take a train), we can infer that the condition of the first statement (Sam took a plane) must also not be true. This is because the condition and the consequence are linked by 'if-then', and if the consequence is false, the condition must also be false. Therefore, we can logically conclude that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
