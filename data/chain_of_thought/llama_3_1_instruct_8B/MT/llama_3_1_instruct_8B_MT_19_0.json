            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Tom did not watch football', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequence (Jen watched basketball) must also be true. However, the second statement 'Jen did not watch basketball' contradicts the consequence of the first statement. \n\nSince the consequence of the first statement is not true (Jen did not watch basketball), we cannot conclude that the condition of the first statement is true (Tom watched football). However, we cannot directly conclude that Tom did not watch football from the given statements. The statements do not provide any information about Tom's actions directly. They only provide a relationship between Tom's and Jen's actions under a specific condition. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Tom did not watch football' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
