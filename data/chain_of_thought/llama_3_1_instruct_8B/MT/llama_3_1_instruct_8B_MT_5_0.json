            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Jeff did not play basketball', we need to analyze the given statements and their logical connections. The first statement is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'. This is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the consequence (Amy playing tennis) must also be true. The second statement is 'Amy did not play tennis', which is a direct statement about Amy's activity.\n\nTo infer 'Jeff did not play basketball', we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. If Amy did not play tennis, and the only reason she would play tennis is if Jeff played basketball, then it implies that Jeff did not play basketball. This is because if Jeff had played basketball, Amy would have played tennis, but since Amy did not play tennis, it must be that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
