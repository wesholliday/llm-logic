            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The apple was not red' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' is a conditional statement. It implies that if the condition (the apple is red) is true, then the consequence (the banana is yellow) must also be true. However, the second statement 'The banana was not yellow' contradicts the consequence of the first statement. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the consequence is false, it does not necessarily mean the condition is false. However, in this case, we have a direct contradiction between the consequence and the given fact. This means we can use the process of elimination to infer the truth of the condition. If the banana is not yellow, then the condition 'the apple is red' must be false, because if it were true, the banana would be yellow, which contradicts the given fact.\n\nAnswer: yes",
