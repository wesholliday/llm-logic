            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" The original statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement. It does not imply that if Mary was not at the wedding, Sue was not at the wedding. The correct inference would be that if Sue was not at the wedding, we cannot conclude anything about Mary's presence at the wedding. However, the original statement does not provide any information about the relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence when Mary is not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
