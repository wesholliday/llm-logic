            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument involving modus tollens, a form of deductive reasoning. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: if P then Q, and not Q, then not P. In this case, the given statement is \"if the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\" \n\nTo apply modus tollens, we need to see if the given statement can be inverted to fit the form \"if not P, then not Q.\" The original statement is \"if the car was red, then the truck was blue,\" which can be inverted to \"if the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\" This is because the original statement implies a direct relationship between the car's color and the truck's color.\n\nHowever, the question asks if we can infer that \"if the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\" This is not a direct inversion of the original statement. The original statement does not provide any information about what happens when the car is not red; it only states what happens when the car is red. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\n\nAnswer: no",
