            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt, we need to analyze the given statement. The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. However, this does not necessarily mean that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, Mark did not buy the blue shirt. The original statement only provides information about the relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt, not the reverse. It does not provide any information about what Mark would do if Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
