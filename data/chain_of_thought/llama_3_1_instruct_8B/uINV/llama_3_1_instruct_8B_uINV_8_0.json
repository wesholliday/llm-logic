            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake, we need to analyze the given statement. The original statement is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This is a conditional statement, where the condition is \"the vampire was awake\" and the consequence is \"the mummy was awake.\" \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition is not met, the consequence does not necessarily follow. This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" \n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the original statement would be \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\" This is not the same as the statement we are trying to infer, which is \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\" \n\nThe original statement does not provide enough information to infer the latter statement. The original statement only tells us that if the vampire is awake, the mummy is awake, but it does not tell us what happens when the vampire is not awake. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
