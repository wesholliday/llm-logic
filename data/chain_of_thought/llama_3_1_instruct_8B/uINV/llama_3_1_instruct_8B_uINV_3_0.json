            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument involving a conditional statement. The original statement is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel.\" \n\nTo determine if we can infer that if the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel, we need to examine the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not P, then not Q.\" \n\nIn this case, the inverse of the original statement would be \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\" However, we cannot be certain of this inference because the original statement does not provide any information about what happens when the book is not written by James. It only tells us what happens when the book is written by James.\n\nFor example, it's possible that the book is a mystery novel even if it's not written by James. The original statement does not provide any information about the relationship between the author and the genre of the book. Therefore, we cannot be certain of the inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
