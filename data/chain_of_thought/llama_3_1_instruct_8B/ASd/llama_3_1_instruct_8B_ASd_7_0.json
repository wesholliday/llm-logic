This statement is a conditional statement, where the condition is 'the oven is on' and the consequence is 'the kitchen is warm'. \n\nThe given statement does not provide any information about the pilot light. However, it does not explicitly exclude the possibility of the pilot light being out when the oven is on. \n\nIn order to infer 'If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm', we would need additional information that links the pilot light being out to the condition of the kitchen being warm. Since the given statement does not provide this information, we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
