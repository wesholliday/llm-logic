The first statement is a general claim about the effect of fertilizing the lawn, which is that it will be lush and green. However, the second statement adds an additional condition, a drought, which is not present in the first statement. \n\nIn order to infer the second statement from the first, we would need to know that fertilizing the lawn is effective even in the presence of a drought. However, the first statement does not provide this information. It only tells us that fertilizing the lawn will result in a lush and green lawn under unspecified conditions. \n\nTherefore, we cannot be certain that fertilizing the lawn will result in a lush and green lawn even if there is a drought, because the first statement does not provide information about the lawn's response to drought conditions.\n\nAnswer: no",
