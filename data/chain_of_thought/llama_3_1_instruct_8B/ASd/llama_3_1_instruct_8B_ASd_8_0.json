            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today', we need to analyze the original statement 'If the package has shipped, then it will arrive today'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the package has shipped' and Q is 'it will arrive today'.\n\nThe original statement does not provide any information about the condition under which the package will arrive today. It only states that if the package has shipped, it will arrive today, regardless of any other factors. However, the new statement 'If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today' adds an additional condition 'it was misrouted' to the original condition 'the package has shipped'.\n\nIn logic, adding a new condition to a conditional statement does not necessarily make the original statement true. In this case, the original statement does not guarantee that the package will arrive today if it was misrouted. Misrouting could potentially delay the package's arrival, so the new statement is not a logical consequence of the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today' from the original statement 'If the package has shipped, then it will arrive today'.\n\nAnswer: no",
