            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The sprocket is cranked', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is a disjunction, which means it presents two possibilities: either the sprocket is cranked or it is daggled. The second statement explicitly states that the sprocket is not daggled. \n\nGiven that the sprocket is not daggled, we can eliminate the 'daggled' option from the first statement. This leaves us with only one possibility: the sprocket is cranked. Since we have eliminated the other option, we can logically conclude that the sprocket must be cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
