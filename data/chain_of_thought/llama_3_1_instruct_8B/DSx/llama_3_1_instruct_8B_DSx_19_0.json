The first statement is 'Either the smonk is vreebled or it is plagged'. This is a disjunction, meaning it is one of the two options that is true. The second statement is 'The smonk is not plagged'. \n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the smonk is not plagged. Since the smonk is not plagged, we can use the first statement to determine if the smonk is vreebled. The first statement says either the smonk is vreebled or it is plagged. Since the smonk is not plagged, the only remaining option is that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nTherefore, we can logically conclude that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
