'Either the dreb is vroombed or it is spened'\n2. 'The dreb is not spened'\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the dreb is not spened. \n\nNow, let's apply this information to statement 1. Statement 1 is a disjunction, which means it is true if at least one of the options is true. In this case, the two options are 'the dreb is vroombed' and 'it is spened'. \n\nSince we know that 'it is spened' is false (from statement 2), the truth of statement 1 depends solely on the truth of 'the dreb is vroombed'. \n\nTherefore, if statement 1 is true, then 'the dreb is vroombed' must be true, because the only option that makes statement 1 true is 'the dreb is vroombed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
