The first statement 'The book isn't resting on the table' tells us that the book is not in one of the two possible locations mentioned in the second statement. The second statement 'Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table' presents two mutually exclusive possibilities for the book's location. Since we know the book is not resting on the table, we can eliminate that option. This leaves us with only one possibility, which is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
