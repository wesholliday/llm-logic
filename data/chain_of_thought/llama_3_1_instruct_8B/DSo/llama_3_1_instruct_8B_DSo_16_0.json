The first statement 'The pen isn't on my desk' tells us that the pen is not in its usual or expected location, which is the desk. The second statement 'Either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk' presents two possible locations for the pen: the bag or the desk. Since we know the pen is not on the desk, we can use a process of elimination to conclude that the pen must be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
