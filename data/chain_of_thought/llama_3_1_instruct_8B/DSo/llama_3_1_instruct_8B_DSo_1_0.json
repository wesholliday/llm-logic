            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Fido is inside', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Fido is not in the garden' directly tells us that Fido is not in the garden. The second statement 'Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden' presents a binary choice between two possibilities: Fido is either inside or in the garden. \n\nSince we know from the first statement that Fido is not in the garden, we can eliminate the 'Fido is in the garden' option from the second statement. This leaves us with only one possibility: Fido is inside. Therefore, we can logically conclude that Fido is indeed inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
