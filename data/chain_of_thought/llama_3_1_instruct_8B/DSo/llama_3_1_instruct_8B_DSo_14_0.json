            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The milk is on the counter', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'The milk isn't chilling in the fridge' tells us that the milk is not in the fridge. The second statement 'Either the milk is on the counter or it is chilling in the fridge' presents a binary situation where the milk is either on the counter or in the fridge. Since we know the milk is not in the fridge from the first statement, we can conclude that the milk must be on the counter, as it is the only remaining option in the binary situation presented by the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
