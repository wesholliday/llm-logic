            "content": "Explanation: To determine the validity of the argument, we need to analyze the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise is 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding', which can be rewritten as 'It's possible that Mary was not at the wedding'. The conclusion is 'Mary might not have been at the wedding', which is equivalent to 'It's possible that Mary was not at the wedding'. \n\nIn this argument, the premise and the conclusion are logically equivalent, as they both express the same possibility. The premise directly supports the conclusion, and there is no logical contradiction or fallacy that would make the argument invalid. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
