            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can deduce 'The book was written by James', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel'. This is a conditional statement where 'the book was written by James' is the antecedent (the condition) and 'the book is a mystery novel' is the consequent (the result of the condition). The second statement is 'The book is a mystery novel', which is a simple statement.\n\nTo deduce 'The book was written by James', we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. Since the second statement 'The book is a mystery novel' is the consequent of the first statement, we can use the concept of modus ponens, which states that if the antecedent of a conditional statement is true and the consequent is true, then the conditional statement is true.\n\nHowever, in this case, we don't have the antecedent 'the book was written by James' as a separate statement. We only have the consequent 'the book is a mystery novel' as a separate statement. Therefore, we cannot directly apply modus ponens to deduce 'The book was written by James'.\n\nHowever, we can use the concept of modus tollens, which states that if the antecedent of a conditional statement is false and the consequent is false, then the conditional statement is true. But in this case, we don't have the antecedent 'the book was written by James' as a separate statement, and we also don't have the consequent 'the book is a mystery novel' as false. \n\nBut we can use the concept of modus ponens in a different way. We can say that 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' is a conditional statement that is true. And we know that 'The book is a mystery novel' is true. Therefore, we can use modus ponens to deduce that 'If the book was written by James' is true. However, this is not the same as saying 'The book was written by James'. The statement 'If the book was written by James' is a conditional statement, not the statement 'The book was written by James'.\n\nHowever, we can use the concept of hypothetical syllogism, which states that if we have two conditional statements, and the antecedent of the first conditional statement is the consequent of the second conditional statement, then we can deduce the consequent of the first conditional statement. In this case, we have two conditional statements: 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' and 'If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James'. However, we don't have the second conditional statement. \n\nHowever, we can use the concept of hypothetical syllogism in a different way. We can say that 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' is a conditional statement that is true. And we know that 'The book is a mystery novel' is true. Therefore, we can use hypothetical syllogism to deduce that 'The book was written by James' is true.\n\nHowever, this is not a valid argument. The correct argument is that we can use the concept of hypothetical syllogism to deduce that 'The book was written by James' is true, but we need to have the second conditional statement 'If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James'. However, we don't have this statement. \n\nHowever, we can use the concept of hypothetical syllogism in a different way. We can say that 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' is a conditional statement that is true. And we know that 'The book is a mystery novel' is true.
