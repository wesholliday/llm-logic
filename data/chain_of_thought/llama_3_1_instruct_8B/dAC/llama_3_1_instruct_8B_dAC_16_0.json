            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can deduce 'The shirt was cotton' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.' This means that if the antecedent (the shirt being cotton) is true, the consequent (the pants being denim) must also be true. The second statement is a simple statement: 'The pants were denim.' \n\nTo deduce 'The shirt was cotton,' we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. Since the second statement confirms the consequent of the first statement, we can use a process called modus ponens. Modus ponens is a rule of inference that states: if we have a conditional statement 'If A, then B' and we know that B is true, then we can conclude that A is true.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,' and the pants were indeed denim. Therefore, we can apply modus ponens to conclude that the shirt was cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
