            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can deduce 'Tom watched football' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.' This means that if the condition (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequence (Jen watched basketball) must also be true. The second statement is a simple statement: 'Jen watched basketball.' \n\nTo deduce 'Tom watched football,' we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. Since the first statement is a conditional statement, we can use the modus ponens rule of inference, which states that if we have a conditional statement 'If A, then B' and we know that A is true, then we can conclude that B is true. However, in this case, we are given that Jen watched basketball, not that Tom watched football. Therefore, we cannot directly apply modus ponens to conclude that Tom watched football.\n\nHowever, we can use the modus tollens rule of inference, which states that if we have a conditional statement 'If A, then B' and we know that B is false, then we can conclude that A is false. But in this case, we are given that Jen watched basketball, which is the consequence of Tom watching football, not the negation of the consequence. Therefore, we cannot use modus tollens to conclude that Tom watched football.\n\nHowever, we can use the modus ponens rule of inference in a different way. We can say that 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' is equivalent to 'If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.' Since we know that Jen watched basketball, we can conclude that the condition 'If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football' is false. Therefore, we can conclude that 'If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball' is false. This means that 'If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football' is true. Since we know that Jen watched basketball, we can conclude that Tom watched football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
