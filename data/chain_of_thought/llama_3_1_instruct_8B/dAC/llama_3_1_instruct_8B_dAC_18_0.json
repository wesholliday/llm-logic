            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can deduce 'The doll was plastic' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.' This means that if the condition (the doll being plastic) is true, then the consequence (the truck being metal) must also be true. The second statement is a simple statement: 'The truck was metal.' \n\nTo deduce 'The doll was plastic,' we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. Since the first statement is a conditional statement, we can use it to make a conclusion based on the second statement. If we know that the truck was metal, we can use the first statement to infer that the doll must be plastic, because the condition (the doll being plastic) is true, and the consequence (the truck being metal) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
