            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical reasoning problem involving modus ponens, a form of deductive reasoning. Modus ponens is a rule of inference that states: if P then Q, and P, then Q. In this case, 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is the 'if P then Q' statement, and 'Sue was at the wedding' is the 'P' statement. We are trying to deduce the 'Q' statement, which is 'Mary was at the wedding'.\n\nTo apply modus ponens, we need to check if the given statements match the pattern. The first statement is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', which can be rewritten as 'If M then S', where M is 'Mary was at the wedding' and S is 'Sue was at the wedding'. The second statement is 'Sue was at the wedding', which is S. \n\nNow, we can apply modus ponens by substituting the values of M and S into the 'if P then Q' statement. This gives us 'If M then S' and S, so we can deduce that M is true, which is 'Mary was at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
