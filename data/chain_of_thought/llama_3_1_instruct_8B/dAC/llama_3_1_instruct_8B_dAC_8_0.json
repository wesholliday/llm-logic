            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can deduce 'The vampire was awake' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement is 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake'. This is a conditional statement, where the condition is 'the vampire was awake' and the consequence is 'the mummy was awake'. \n\nThe second statement is 'The mummy was awake'. This is a simple statement that asserts the mummy's state.\n\nTo deduce 'The vampire was awake', we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. Since the first statement is a conditional, we can use it to make a conclusion based on the second statement. If the consequence of the first statement ('the mummy was awake') is true, then we can infer that the condition ('the vampire was awake') must also be true, given the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, since we know 'The mummy was awake' from the second statement, we can use the first statement to conclude that 'The vampire was awake'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
