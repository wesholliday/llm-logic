            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can deduce 'Lisa bought the red shirt' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.' This means that if the condition (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the consequence (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true. The second statement is a simple statement: 'Mark bought the blue shirt.' \n\nTo deduce 'Lisa bought the red shirt,' we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. Since the first statement is a conditional statement, we can use the modus ponens rule of inference, which states that if we have a conditional statement 'If A, then B' and we know that A is true, then we can conclude that B is true. However, in this case, we are given the consequence (Mark bought the blue shirt) as a separate statement, not as a conclusion from the conditional statement. \n\nTherefore, we cannot directly apply modus ponens to deduce 'Lisa bought the red shirt.' However, we can use the second statement (Mark bought the blue shirt) to infer that the condition in the first statement (Lisa bought the red shirt) must be true, because the first statement states that if the condition is true, then the consequence (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true. This is an example of modus tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement 'If A, then B' and we know that B is false, then we can conclude that A is false. However, in this case, we are given that the consequence (Mark bought the blue shirt) is true, not false. \n\nHowever, we can use the first statement to infer that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa must have bought the red shirt. This is because the first statement is a conditional statement that links the two events. Therefore, we can use the second statement (Mark bought the blue shirt) to infer that the condition in the first statement (Lisa bought the red shirt) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
