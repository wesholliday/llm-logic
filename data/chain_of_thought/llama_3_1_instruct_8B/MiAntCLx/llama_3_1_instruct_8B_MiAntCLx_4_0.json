This statement is in the form of a conditional or a possibility, indicated by the word 'might'. It suggests that the location of the floob is uncertain or not confirmed. \n\nHowever, the given statement does not provide any information about the floob's location in relation to the quibble glorp. It only mentions the possibility of the floob being at the flump blimp. Therefore, we cannot infer the floob's presence in the quibble glorp based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
