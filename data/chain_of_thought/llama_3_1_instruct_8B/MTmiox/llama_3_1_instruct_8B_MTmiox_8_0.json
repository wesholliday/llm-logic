            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The sprocket was not cranked', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'The sprocket might not have been daggled', which implies that there is a possibility that the sprocket was not daggled. The second statement is 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled', which is a conditional statement. This statement implies that if the sprocket was cranked, it must have been daggled, but it does not provide any information about the sprocket's state if it was not cranked.\n\nTo infer 'The sprocket was not cranked', we would need to know that the sprocket was daggled, which would lead to a contradiction with the first statement. However, we cannot directly infer the sprocket's crank state from the given statements. The statements do not provide a direct link between the sprocket's crank state and its daggled state when it was not cranked.\n\nHowever, we can use a process of elimination and logical reasoning. If the sprocket was cranked, it must have been daggled according to the second statement. But the first statement says the sprocket might not have been daggled. This means that if the sprocket was daggled, it would contradict the first statement. Therefore, if the sprocket was daggled, it must have been cranked. But we know the sprocket might not have been daggled. Therefore, the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
