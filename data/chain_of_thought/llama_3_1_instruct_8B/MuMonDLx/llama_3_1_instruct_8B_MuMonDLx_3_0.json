The original statement implies a specific location for the zibber, which is inside the floob. However, it does not provide any information about the zibber being on the floob. \n\nIn order to infer 'The zibber must be in the floob or on the floob', we would need additional information or context that suggests the zibber could be on the floob as well. The original statement does not provide this information, so we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
