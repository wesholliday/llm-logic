            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The mummy was awake', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'The vampire was awake', which is a simple statement. The second statement is 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake', which is a conditional statement. This conditional statement implies that if the condition (the vampire being awake) is true, then the consequence (the mummy being awake) must also be true.\n\nGiven that the first statement 'The vampire was awake' is true, we can use the second statement to make an inference. Since the condition in the conditional statement is met (the vampire is awake), the consequence (the mummy was awake) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can logically infer that 'The mummy was awake'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
