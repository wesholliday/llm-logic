            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Sue was at the wedding', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Mary was at the wedding' is a simple statement of fact. The second statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement. This type of statement implies that if the condition (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true. However, the first statement does not necessarily imply that the condition is true. It only states that Mary was at the wedding, not that it was a condition for Sue's presence. Therefore, we cannot directly infer 'Sue was at the wedding' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
