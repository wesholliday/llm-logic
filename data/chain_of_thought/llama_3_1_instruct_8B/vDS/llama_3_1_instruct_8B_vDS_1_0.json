            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the form of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument is a simple disjunctive syllogism, which is a form of argument that uses a disjunction (either/or) in one of its premises and eliminates one of the disjuncts in the conclusion.\n\nThe first premise is 'Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden', which is a disjunction. The second premise is 'Fido is not in the garden', which is a negation of one of the disjuncts in the first premise. \n\nIn a disjunctive syllogism, if one of the disjuncts is eliminated, the other disjunct must be true. In this case, since 'Fido is not in the garden' eliminates one of the disjuncts, the other disjunct, 'Fido is inside', must be true. Therefore, the conclusion 'Fido is inside' logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
