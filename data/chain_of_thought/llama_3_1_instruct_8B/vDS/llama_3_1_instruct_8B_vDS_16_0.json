            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a simple example of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a form of argument that uses a disjunction (either/or) in its premises. In this case, the first premise is a disjunction: 'Either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk.' The second premise is a negation of one of the disjuncts: 'The pen isn't on my desk.' \n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, if the pen is not on the desk, then it must be in the bag, as those are the only two options presented in the first premise. This is a classic example of a valid argument form, as it follows the rules of logical reasoning.\n\nAnswer: yes",
