            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a simple disjunctive syllogism, which is a type of argument that uses a disjunction (either/or) in its premises and conclusion. \n\nThe first premise states that the remote control is either on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch. This is a disjunction, which can be represented as P \u2228 Q, where P is \"the remote control is on the coffee table\" and Q is \"the remote control is hiding under the couch\".\n\nThe second premise states that the remote control isn't hiding under the couch, which can be represented as \u00acQ, where \u00ac is the negation operator.\n\nThe conclusion states that the remote control is on the coffee table, which is P.\n\nA disjunctive syllogism is valid if it follows the following form: \n\n1. P \u2228 Q\n2. \u00acQ\n3. \u2234 P\n\nIn this case, the argument matches this form: \n\n1. The remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch (P \u2228 Q)\n2. The remote control isn't hiding under the couch (\u00acQ)\n3. \u2234 The remote control is on the coffee table (P)\n\nSince the argument follows the form of a disjunctive syllogism, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
