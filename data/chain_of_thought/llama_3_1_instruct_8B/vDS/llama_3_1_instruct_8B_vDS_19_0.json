            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument is a simple example of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a form of argument that involves a disjunction (either/or) in one of the premises and a negation of one of the disjuncts in the other premise.\n\nThe first premise is 'Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist.' This is a disjunction, which can be represented as P \u2228 Q, where P is 'the watch is charging on the dresser' and Q is 'the watch is on his wrist.'\n\nThe second premise is 'The watch isn't on his wrist,' which can be represented as \u00acQ, where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\nThe conclusion is 'The watch is charging on the dresser,' which is P.\n\nIn a disjunctive syllogism, if one of the disjuncts is negated, the other disjunct must be true. In this case, since Q (the watch is on his wrist) is negated, P (the watch is charging on the dresser) must be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
