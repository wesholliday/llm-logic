            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a simple example of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a form of argument that uses a disjunction (either/or) to reach a conclusion. \n\nIn this case, the first premise is a disjunction: 'Either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet'. This means that one of the two options must be true. The second premise is a negation of one of the disjuncts: 'The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet'. This means that we can eliminate one of the options from the disjunction. \n\nSince the second premise eliminates the option of the keys being in the cabinet, we are left with the only remaining option: the keys must be in the drawer. This is the conclusion of the argument.\n\nThe form of the argument is: \n1. P or Q (Either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet)\n2. Not Q (The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet)\n3. Therefore, P (The keys are in the drawer)\n\nThis form is a valid form of argument, as it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The conclusion logically follows from the premises, and the argument is not vulnerable to counterexamples or fallacies.\n\nAnswer: yes",
