            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a simple disjunctive syllogism, which is a type of argument that uses a disjunction (either/or) to reach a conclusion. The argument is as follows:\n\n1. Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table.\n2. The book isn't resting on the table.\n3. Therefore, the book is on the shelf.\n\nTo check for validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the second premise directly contradicts one of the disjuncts in the first premise, which is 'it is resting on the table'. This leaves us with the other disjunct, 'the book is on the shelf', as the only remaining possibility. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
