            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Mary was at the wedding', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue was at the wedding) is also true. The second statement 'Sue was at the wedding' is a simple statement that provides information about Sue's presence at the wedding.\n\nTo infer 'Mary was at the wedding', we need to use the first statement as a bridge to connect the information from the second statement. Since we know 'Sue was at the wedding' and the first statement tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding, we can use this information to make an inference. However, the first statement does not directly tell us that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding. It only tells us the opposite. Therefore, we cannot directly infer 'Mary was at the wedding' from the given statements.\n\nHowever, we can use a process of elimination and logical reasoning to make an inference. If we assume that Sue was at the wedding, then we can use the first statement to conclude that Mary must have been at the wedding as well, because the condition (Mary was at the wedding) is met. But since we are given 'Sue was at the wedding' as a separate statement, we can use this information to make an inference. \n\nAnswer: yes",
