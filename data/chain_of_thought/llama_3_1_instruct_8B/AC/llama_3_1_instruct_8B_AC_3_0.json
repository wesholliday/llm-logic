            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The book was written by James', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' is a conditional statement. It implies that if the condition (the book was written by James) is true, then the consequence (the book is a mystery novel) is also true. The second statement 'The book is a mystery novel' is a simple statement that we know is true.\n\nTo infer 'The book was written by James', we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. Since the first statement is a conditional, we can use the modus ponens rule of inference, which states that if we have a conditional statement 'If A, then B' and we know that A is true, then we can conclude that B is true. However, in this case, we are given that B (the book is a mystery novel) is true, not A (the book was written by James). \n\nHowever, we can use the contrapositive of the first statement, which is 'If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James'. Since we know that the book is a mystery novel, we can conclude that the book was written by James using the contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: yes",
