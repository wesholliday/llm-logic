            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical inference using the concept of contrapositive. The original statement is in the form of 'If p, then q', where p is 'Mary was at the wedding' and q is 'Sue was at the wedding'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If not q, then not p', which is 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding'. This is a logically equivalent statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nHowever, the statement we are trying to infer is 'If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding', which is the inverse of the original statement, not the contrapositive. The inverse of 'If p, then q' is 'If not q, then not p'. While the contrapositive and the inverse are logically equivalent, they are not the same thing.\n\nIn this case, we cannot directly infer 'If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding' from the original statement. We can only infer the contrapositive, which is 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer: no",
