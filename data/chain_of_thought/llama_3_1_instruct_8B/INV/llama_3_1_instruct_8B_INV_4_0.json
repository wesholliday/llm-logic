            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter'. This statement is an example of a conditional statement, where the 'if' part is the antecedent (the condition) and the 'then' part is the consequent (the outcome). \n\nIn this case, the given statement implies a direct relationship between the alien visiting Mars and the robot visiting Jupiter. However, it does not provide any information about the relationship between the alien not visiting Mars and the robot not visiting Jupiter. \n\nTo infer the second statement, we would need to know that the alien's visit to Mars is the only reason for the robot to visit Jupiter, or that the robot's visit to Jupiter is dependent solely on the alien's visit to Mars. Without this information, we cannot be certain that the robot's visit to Jupiter is directly linked to the alien's visit to Mars.\n\nHowever, we can use a logical rule called 'contrapositive' to infer the second statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. In this case, the contrapositive of the given statement would be 'If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars'. This is a valid inference because it is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nBut the original question asks for 'If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter', which is the inverse of the contrapositive. The inverse of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. The inverse of the given statement would be 'If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars'. The inverse is not necessarily true, and it is not the same as the contrapositive.\n\nHowever, we can use another logical rule called 'modus tollens' to infer the second statement. Modus tollens is a rule that states 'If A, then B' and 'not B', then 'not A'. In this case, we can use modus tollens to infer 'If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter' from the given statement and the assumption that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
