            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument involving modus tollens, a form of deductive reasoning. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: if P implies Q, and not Q, then not P. In this case, the given statement is 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry'. This can be represented as: \n\nC \u2192 B (If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry)\n\nWe are asked to infer 'If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry'. This can be represented as: \n\n~C \u2192 ~B (If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry)\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we need to check if it follows the modus tollens rule. The given statement is in the form of 'If P, then Q', and we are trying to infer 'If not P, then not Q'. This is indeed the correct form of modus tollens.\n\nHowever, we need to be careful because the original statement only tells us that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry. It does not tell us that if the muffins are not blueberry, then the cake is not chocolate. This is known as the converse of the original statement, and it is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the cake was not chocolate, then we cannot be certain that the muffins were not blueberry. The original statement does not provide enough information to make this inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
