            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical inference using the concept of contrapositive. The original statement is in the form of 'If A, then B', which is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'. To infer the contrapositive, we need to negate both the hypothesis and the conclusion, resulting in 'If not A, then not B'. \n\nIn this case, the hypothesis 'the doll was plastic' is negated to 'the doll was not plastic', and the conclusion 'the truck was metal' is negated to 'the truck was not metal'. Therefore, we can logically infer that 'If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
