            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical inference using the concept of contrapositive. The original statement is in the form of 'If p, then q', where p is 'Sue chose pizza' and q is 'Bob chose pasta'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If not q, then not p', which is 'If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza'. This is a logically equivalent statement to the original one. Therefore, we can infer that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta, as it is a direct consequence of the contrapositive relationship.\n\nAnswer: yes",
