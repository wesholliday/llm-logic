            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical inference using the concept of contrapositive. The original statement is a conditional statement in the form of 'If A, then B', where A is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and B is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If not B, then not A', which is 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt'. However, the statement we are trying to infer is 'If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt', which is the inverse of the original statement, not the contrapositive. The inverse of the original statement is 'If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark may or may not have bought the blue shirt'. Since the inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement, we cannot infer the given statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
