This statement is in the form of a conditional statement, where the condition is 'the book was written by James' and the consequence is 'the book is a mystery novel'. \n\nThe given statement does not explicitly state that only James can write mystery novels, or that no one else can write mystery novels. It only states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. This means that there could be other books that are also mystery novels but were not written by James.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that 'If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel' because there could be other books that are mystery novels but were not written by James.\n\nAnswer: no",
