            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument involving modus tollens, a form of argument in deductive reasoning. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: if P implies Q, and not Q, then not P. In this case, the given statement is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'. This can be represented as: If A (apple is red) then B (banana is yellow). \n\nNow, we are asked to infer 'If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow'. This can be represented as: If not A (apple is not red) then not B (banana is not yellow). \n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we need to check if it follows the modus tollens rule. The original statement is 'If A then B', and we are given 'not B'. If we apply the modus tollens rule, we can conclude that 'not A'. However, we are asked to infer 'not B' from 'not A', which is not a direct application of modus tollens. \n\nIn this case, we can see that the original statement is a specific case of a more general statement: 'If the apple is a certain color, then the banana is a certain color'. The original statement only tells us about the relationship between the color of the apple and the banana in one specific case (when the apple is red). It does not provide any information about the relationship between the color of the apple and the banana in other cases (when the apple is not red). Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
