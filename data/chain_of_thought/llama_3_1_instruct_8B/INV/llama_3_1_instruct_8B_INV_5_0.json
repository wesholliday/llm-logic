            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis', we need to analyze the original statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'Jeff played basketball' and Q is 'Amy played tennis'. \n\nIn a conditional statement, the converse of the statement is 'If Q, then P', and the contrapositive is 'If not Q, then not P'. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nSo, the contrapositive of 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis' is 'If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball'. However, the statement we are trying to infer is 'If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis', which is the contrapositive of 'If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball'. This is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
