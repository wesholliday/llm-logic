            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical inference using the concept of contrapositive. The original statement is in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the bear was in the cave' and Q is 'the wolf was in the den'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If not Q, then not P', which is 'If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave'. \n\nHowever, the statement we are trying to infer is 'If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den', which is the inverse of the original statement, not the contrapositive. The inverse of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not P, then not Q'. \n\nIn this case, we can infer the inverse because the original statement is a universal conditional statement, implying that it is true for all cases. Since the original statement is true, we can logically conclude that the inverse is also true. This is because if the original statement is true for all cases, then the inverse must also be true for all cases.\n\nAnswer: yes",
