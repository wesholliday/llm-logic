            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument involving contrapositives. The original statement is a conditional statement of the form 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the car was red' and Q is 'the truck was blue'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If not Q, then not P', which is 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red'. \n\nHowever, the statement we are trying to infer is 'If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue', which is the inverse of the original statement, not the contrapositive. The inverse of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not P, then not Q'. \n\nIn general, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, but the inverse is not. Therefore, we cannot logically infer 'If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue' from the original statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'.\n\nAnswer: no",
