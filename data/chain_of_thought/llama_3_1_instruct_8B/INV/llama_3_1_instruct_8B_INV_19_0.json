            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical inference using the concept of contrapositive. The original statement is in the form of 'If A, then B', which is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'. To infer the contrapositive, we need to negate both the hypothesis and the conclusion, resulting in 'If not A, then not B'. \n\nIn this case, the hypothesis is 'Tom watched football' and the conclusion is 'Jen watched basketball'. To negate them, we get 'Tom did not watch football' and 'Jen did not watch basketball'. Therefore, the contrapositive of the original statement is indeed 'If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
