    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

            "content": "Explanation: To determine if it follows that it's likely that, if the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, the sulect will, we need to analyze the given information. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. This means that the jantiz has a higher chance of getting the zulision than the cramen, and the cramen has a higher chance than the sulect. \n\nGiven that the jantiz likely will get the zulision and the cramen likely won't, we can infer that the jantiz's likelihood of getting the zulision is higher than the cramen's, and the cramen's likelihood of not getting it is higher than the sulect's. However, this does not directly imply that the jantiz's likelihood of not getting the zulision is higher than the sulect's. \n\nIn fact, if the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, it's possible that the cramen might get it, given that the cramen is more qualified than the sulect. Therefore, it's not necessarily true that if the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, the sulect will get it. The cramen could potentially get it instead.\n\nAnswer: no",
