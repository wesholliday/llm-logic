            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The splat was not morphed', let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. 'It's not the case that the splat must have quanked' can be rewritten as 'It is not necessary that the splat quanked'. This statement implies that quanking is not a requirement for the splat.\n\n2. 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked' is a conditional statement. This means that if the splat was morphed, then quanking is a requirement for the splat.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. If it's not necessary for the splat to quank, and if morphing the splat requires quanking, then it's possible that the splat was morphed without quanking. However, this would contradict the second statement. Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, we can conclude that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
