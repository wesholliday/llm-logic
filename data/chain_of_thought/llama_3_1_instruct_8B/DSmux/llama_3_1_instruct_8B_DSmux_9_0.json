'Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked' is a disjunction, which means it is true if at least one of the options is true. This statement can be represented as: (V \u2228 P), where V represents 'the twonk is varnished' and P represents 'the twonk must be plinked'.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked' can be represented as \u00acP, where \u00ac represents 'not'. This statement is equivalent to saying 'the twonk does not have to be plinked'.\n\nNow, let's apply the rules of logic to the given statements:\n\nFrom the first statement, we have (V \u2228 P).\n\nFrom the second statement, we have \u00acP.\n\nUsing the rule of disjunction and negation, we can infer that if (V \u2228 P) is true and P is false, then V must be true. This is because if P is false, the only way for (V \u2228 P) to be true is if V is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'The twonk is varnished'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
