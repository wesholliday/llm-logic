The first statement is 'Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned'. This is a disjunction, which means it is true if at least one of the options is true. The second statement is 'It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned', which can be rewritten as 'The fleeg is not necessarily surned'. \n\nFrom the second statement, we can infer that the first option in the disjunction, 'the fleeg is bluttered', is the only possible option left. This is because if the fleeg is not necessarily surned, then the only other option, 'the fleeg is bluttered', must be true for the disjunction to hold.\n\nAnswer: yes",
