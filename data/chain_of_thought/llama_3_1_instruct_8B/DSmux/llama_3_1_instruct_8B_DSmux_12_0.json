'Either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped' can be translated to a logical expression as: (S \u2228 L), where S represents 'The smip is shripped' and L represents 'The smip must be lupped'.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the smip must be lupped' can be translated to a logical expression as: \u00acL.\n\nNow, we have two statements: (S \u2228 L) and \u00acL. To determine if we can infer S, we need to see if the statements are logically consistent and if they provide enough information to conclude S.\n\nSince \u00acL is true, we know that L is false. Given that (S \u2228 L) is true and L is false, we can use the rule of disjunction elimination, which states that if (P \u2228 Q) is true and Q is false, then P must be true.\n\nTherefore, since L is false, we can conclude that S must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
