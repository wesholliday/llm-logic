            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The splat is morphed', let's break down the given statements.\n\n1. 'Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked' can be translated to a logical expression as: (Morphed \u2228 Quanked)\n2. 'It's not the case that the splat must be quanked' can be translated to a logical expression as: \u00acQuanked\n\nWe can use the first statement to create a truth table or apply logical rules to simplify it. However, the second statement directly tells us that the splat does not have to be quanked, which means Quanked is false.\n\nGiven that Quanked is false, we can substitute this into the first statement: (Morphed \u2228 False). In a logical OR operation, if one of the conditions is false, the entire expression is true if the other condition is true.\n\nTherefore, for the first statement to be true, Morphed must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
