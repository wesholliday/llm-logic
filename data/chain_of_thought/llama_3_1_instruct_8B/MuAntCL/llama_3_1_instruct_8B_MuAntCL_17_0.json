The statement 'The report must have been accurate' only provides information about the report's accuracy, but it does not provide any information about the timing of the report's submission. The accuracy of the report does not necessarily imply that it was submitted by a specific time, such as noon. Therefore, we cannot infer the additional information about the submission time from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
