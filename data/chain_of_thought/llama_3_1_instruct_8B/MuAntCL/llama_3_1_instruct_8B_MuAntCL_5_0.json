            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The package must have been delivered yesterday and signed for', let's break down the information given. The statement 'The package must have been delivered yesterday' implies that the package was delivered on the previous day. However, it does not provide any information about whether the recipient signed for it. Signing for a package is a separate action that may or may not have occurred. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the package was signed for, as there is no information about the recipient's actions after the delivery.\n\nAnswer: no",
