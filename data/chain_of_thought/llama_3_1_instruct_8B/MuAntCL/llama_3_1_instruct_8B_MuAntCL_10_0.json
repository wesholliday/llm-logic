            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The document must have been signed and notarized' from 'The document must have been signed', we need to consider the relationship between the two statements. 'The document must have been signed' implies that the document has undergone a process of signing, which is a common requirement for many documents. However, notarization is a separate process that involves verifying the identity of the signer and the authenticity of the document, which is not necessarily implied by the statement 'The document must have been signed'. Notarization is not a requirement for all signed documents, and it's possible for a document to be signed without being notarized. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'The document must have been signed and notarized' from 'The document must have been signed' alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
