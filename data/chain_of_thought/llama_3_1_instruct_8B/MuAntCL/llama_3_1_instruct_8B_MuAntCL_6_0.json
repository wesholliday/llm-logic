            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The concert must have been sold out' implies that all available tickets for the concert have been purchased, but it does not provide any information about the start time of the concert. The start time of the concert could be any time, and the statement about the concert being sold out does not necessarily relate to the start time. Therefore, we cannot infer that the concert must have started at 8 PM based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
