This statement only provides information about the deadline for the project's completion, which is by Friday. It does not provide any information about the project's budget or whether it was completed under budget.\n\nIn order to infer that the project was completed under budget, we would need additional information, such as 'The project was completed by Friday and was under budget'. The given statement does not provide this information, so we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
