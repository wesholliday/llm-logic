The first statement tells us that the book is either on the shelf or it is resting on the table. This gives us two possible locations for the book. The second statement tells us that the book is not resting on the table. Since we know the book is not on the table, we can eliminate that option from the first statement. This leaves us with only one possibility: the book must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
