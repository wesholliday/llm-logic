            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the keys are in the drawer, we need to analyze the given information. The first statement tells us that the keys are either in the drawer or in the cabinet. This is a classic example of a disjunctive statement, where the keys are in one of two possible locations. The second statement tells us that the keys are not in the cabinet. \n\nUsing the process of elimination, we can conclude that since the keys are not in the cabinet, they must be in the other location, which is the drawer. This is because the two locations are mutually exclusive, and we have eliminated one of them.\n\nAnswer: yes",
