Fido is not in the garden.\n\nFrom the second statement, we can directly conclude that Fido is not in the garden. The first statement is a disjunction (either/or statement), which means it includes both possibilities (inside and in the garden). However, since we know Fido is not in the garden, we can infer that the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside. This is because the disjunction includes both possibilities, and we have eliminated one of them (Fido being in the garden). Therefore, by the process of elimination, we can conclude that Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
