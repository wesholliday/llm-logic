The first statement says that the milk is either on the counter or in the fridge. This is a disjunctive statement, meaning it presents two possible locations for the milk. The second statement says that the milk is not in the fridge. Since the milk is not in the fridge, we can eliminate one of the possibilities from the first statement. This leaves us with only one option: the milk must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
