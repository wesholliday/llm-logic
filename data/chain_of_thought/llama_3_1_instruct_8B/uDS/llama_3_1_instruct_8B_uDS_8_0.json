            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the remote control is on the coffee table, we need to analyze the given information. The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch\" presents two possible locations for the remote control. The second statement, \"the remote control isn't hiding under the couch,\" directly eliminates one of the possible locations. Since we know the remote control is not under the couch, we can conclude that it must be on the coffee table, as it is the only remaining option.\n\nAnswer: yes",
