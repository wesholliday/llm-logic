The first statement says that the shoes are either in the closet or lined up by the door. This is a disjunction, meaning it's a statement that includes two possibilities. The second statement says that the shoes aren't lined up by the door. \n\nFrom the second statement, we can conclude that the shoes are not in the position of being lined up by the door. Since the first statement says that the shoes are either in the closet or lined up by the door, and we know they're not lined up by the door, we can use a process of elimination to infer that the shoes must be in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
