The first statement tells us that the cookies are either in the jar or hidden in the pantry. This is a disjunctive statement, meaning it presents two mutually exclusive possibilities. The second statement tells us that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry. \n\nSince the two possibilities are mutually exclusive, and we know that one of them is not true (the cookies are not hidden in the pantry), we can infer that the other possibility must be true. Therefore, if the cookies are not in the pantry, they must be in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
