            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that the toy is in the toy box, we need to analyze the given information. The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf\" presents two possible locations for the toy. This is a disjunctive statement, meaning it includes two mutually exclusive possibilities. The second statement, \"the toy isn't sitting on the shelf,\" directly contradicts one of the possibilities in the first statement. \n\nSince the toy cannot be in two places at once, and we know it's not on the shelf, we can logically conclude that the toy must be in the toy box. This is because the only remaining option from the disjunctive statement is that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
