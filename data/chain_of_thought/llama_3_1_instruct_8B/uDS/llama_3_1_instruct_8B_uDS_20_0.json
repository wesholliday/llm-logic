The first statement says that the sunglasses are either in her bag or on her head. This is a disjunctive statement, meaning it presents two possible locations for the sunglasses. The second statement tells us that the sunglasses are not on her head. Since the sunglasses are not on her head, we can eliminate that option from the first statement. This leaves us with only one possibility: the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
