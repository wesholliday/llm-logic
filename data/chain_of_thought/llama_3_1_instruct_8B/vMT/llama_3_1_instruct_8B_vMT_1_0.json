            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional statement with a negated consequent, which is a type of argument known as modus tollens. The form of the argument is:\n\n1. If A, then B (If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding)\n2. Not B (Sue was not at the wedding)\n3. Therefore, Not A (Mary was not at the wedding)\n\nIn modus tollens, the first premise is a conditional statement, and the second premise is the negation of the consequent. The conclusion is the negation of the antecedent. This form is considered logically valid because it follows the rules of logical reasoning: if the consequent of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent must also be false.\n\nHowever, in this specific argument, the conclusion is the negation of the antecedent, but the first premise is not a universal statement. It is a specific conditional statement that only applies to the situation where Mary was at the wedding. The argument is trying to make a general conclusion about Mary's presence at the wedding based on a specific conditional statement. This is a problem because the conditional statement does not provide enough information to make a general conclusion about Mary's presence.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because it is trying to make a general conclusion from a specific conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
