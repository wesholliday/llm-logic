            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional argument, which means it has a conditional statement as one of its premises. The conditional statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\nThe second premise is \"The banana was not yellow,\" which can be represented as \u00acQ.\n\nThe conclusion is \"The apple was not red,\" which can be represented as \u00acP.\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the argument is an example of a modus tollens argument, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: If P \u2192 Q, and \u00acQ, then \u00acP.\n\nIn this argument, we have P \u2192 Q (the apple was red, then the banana was yellow), and \u00acQ (the banana was not yellow). Using modus tollens, we can infer that \u00acP (the apple was not red).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
