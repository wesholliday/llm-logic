            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional argument, which means it has a conditional statement as one of its premises. The conditional statement is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'. This can be represented as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the shirt was cotton' and Q is 'the pants were denim'.\n\nThe second premise is 'The pants were not denim', which is the negation of Q. \n\nThe conclusion is 'The shirt was not cotton', which is the negation of P.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the second premise (Q is false) does not provide any information about P. The conditional statement 'If P, then Q' only tells us that if P is true, then Q must be true. It does not tell us that if Q is false, then P must be false.\n\nIn other words, the fact that the pants were not denim does not provide any information about the material of the shirt. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the shirt was not cotton based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
