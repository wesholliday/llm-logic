            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a form of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: if P implies Q, and not Q, then not P.\n\nIn this argument, the first premise is 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry', which can be represented as 'P \u2192 Q'. The second premise is 'The muffins were not blueberry', which can be represented as 'not Q'. The conclusion is 'The cake was not chocolate', which can be represented as 'not P'.\n\nUsing the modus tollens rule, if P \u2192 Q and not Q, then we can logically conclude that not P. Therefore, the argument follows a valid form of reasoning.\n\nAnswer: yes",
