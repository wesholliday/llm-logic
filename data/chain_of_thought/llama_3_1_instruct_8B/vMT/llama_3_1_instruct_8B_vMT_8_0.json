            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional argument, where the conclusion is derived from the premises. The first premise is 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake', which is a conditional statement. The second premise is 'The mummy was not awake', which is a negation of the consequent of the first premise. \n\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The conclusion is 'The vampire was not awake'. If the mummy was not awake, it does not necessarily mean that the vampire was not awake. The first premise only states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake, but it does not state that if the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake. This is an example of a fallacy known as affirming the consequent, where we assume that if the consequent is not true, then the antecedent must also be not true.\n\nHowever, in this case, the argument is actually an example of a valid form of argument known as modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that follows the pattern: If A, then B. Not B. Therefore, not A. In this case, the first premise is 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake', the second premise is 'The mummy was not awake', and the conclusion is 'The vampire was not awake'. This form of argument is valid because it follows the rules of logical reasoning.\n\nAnswer: yes",
