            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional argument, which has the form 'If P, then Q' and 'not Q', and concludes 'not P'. This is a classic example of a modus tollens argument. In modus tollens, if the antecedent (P) is true and the consequent (Q) is false, then the negation of the antecedent (not P) is true. In this case, the antecedent is 'Tom watched football' (P), the consequent is 'Jen watched basketball' (Q), and the negation of the consequent is 'Jen did not watch basketball' (not Q). \n\nThe argument follows the modus tollens form, which is a valid form of argument. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
