            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional argument, which means it has a conditional statement as one of its premises. The conditional statement is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'. This can be represented as 'P \u2192 Q', where P is 'the doll was plastic' and Q is 'the truck was metal'.\n\nThe second premise is 'The truck was not metal', which can be represented as '~Q', where '~' denotes negation.\n\nThe conclusion is 'The doll was not plastic', which can be represented as '~P'.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the first premise is a conditional statement, and the second premise is the negation of the consequent of the conditional statement. This is a specific form of argument known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument.\n\nModus tollens is a rule of inference that states: If P \u2192 Q, and ~Q, then ~P. In this case, P is 'the doll was plastic', Q is 'the truck was metal', and ~Q is 'the truck was not metal'. Since the second premise is the negation of Q, we can apply modus tollens to conclude that ~P, which is 'The doll was not plastic'.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
