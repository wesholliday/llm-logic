            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the form of the argument and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional argument, which means it has a conditional statement as one of its premises. The conditional statement is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nThe second premise is \"Amy did not play tennis,\" which can be represented as \u00acQ.\n\nThe conclusion is \"Jeff did not play basketball,\" which can be represented as \u00acP.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the argument is an example of a modus tollens argument, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: if P \u2192 Q, and \u00acQ, then \u00acP.\n\nIn this case, we have P \u2192 Q (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis), and \u00acQ (Amy did not play tennis). According to the rule of modus tollens, if we have a conditional statement and the negation of the consequent, we can conclude the negation of the antecedent. Therefore, we can conclude that \u00acP (Jeff did not play basketball).\n\nAnswer: yes",
