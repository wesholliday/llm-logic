            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional argument, which means it involves a conditional statement (if-then statement) as one of its premises. The conditional statement is 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad'. This can be represented as 'P \u2192 Q', where P is 'Ben ate pasta' and Q is 'Kate ate salad'.\n\nThe second premise is 'Kate did not eat salad', which can be represented as '~Q', where '~' denotes negation.\n\nThe conclusion is 'Ben did not eat pasta', which can be represented as '~P'.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the argument is an example of a modus tollens argument, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: if P \u2192 Q, and ~Q, then ~P.\n\nIn this argument, we have P \u2192 Q (Ben ate pasta \u2192 Kate ate salad) and ~Q (Kate did not eat salad). If we apply the modus tollens rule, we can conclude that ~P (Ben did not eat pasta).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
