            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional argument, which means it involves a conditional statement (if-then statement) as one of its premises. The first premise is 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train', which is a conditional statement. The second premise is 'Erin did not take a train', which is a simple statement. The conclusion is 'Sam did not take a plane'.\n\nTo evaluate the argument's validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. We can do this by using a truth table or by analyzing the argument's form. In this case, let's analyze the argument's form.\n\nThe argument's form is:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train)\n2. Not Q (Erin did not take a train)\n3. Not P (Sam did not take a plane)\n\nThe argument's form is a modus tollens argument, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: if P implies Q, and not Q, then not P. In this case, the first premise is P implies Q (If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train), the second premise is not Q (Erin did not take a train), and the conclusion is not P (Sam did not take a plane).\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens form, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
