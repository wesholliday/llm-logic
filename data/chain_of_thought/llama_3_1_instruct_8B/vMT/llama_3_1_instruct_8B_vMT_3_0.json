            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a form of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: if P implies Q, and not Q, then not P.\n\nIn this argument, the first premise is 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel', which can be represented as 'P implies Q'. The second premise is 'The book is not a mystery novel', which can be represented as 'not Q'. The conclusion is 'The book was not written by James', which can be represented as 'not P'.\n\nThe argument follows the modus tollens form: if P implies Q, and not Q, then not P. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
