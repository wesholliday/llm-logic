            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional argument, which means it involves a conditional statement (if-then statement) and a negation of the consequent (the 'then' part of the conditional statement). The argument is:\n\n1. If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n2. The truck was not blue.\n3. Therefore, the car was not red.\n\nTo check for validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. We can do this by using a truth table or by analyzing the argument's form. In this case, let's analyze the form.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement: 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue.' This can be represented as 'p \u2192 q', where 'p' is 'the car was red' and 'q' is 'the truck was blue.'\n\nThe second premise is a negation of the consequent: 'The truck was not blue.' This can be represented as '~q', where '~' denotes negation.\n\nThe conclusion is the negation of the antecedent: 'The car was not red.' This can be represented as '~p'.\n\nThe argument's form is: p \u2192 q, ~q \u2234 ~p\n\nThis form is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens states that if a conditional statement is true and the consequent is false, then the antecedent must be false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
