            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional argument, which means it has a conditional statement as one of its premises. The conditional statement is 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest'. This can be represented as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the griffin was in the forest' and Q is 'the unicorn was in the forest'.\n\nThe second premise is 'The unicorn was not in the forest', which is the negation of Q. \n\nThe conclusion is 'The griffin was not in the forest', which is the negation of P.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion follows from the premises. If we negate the conditional statement, we get 'The griffin was in the forest and the unicorn was not in the forest'. This is not the same as the conclusion, which is the negation of the first part of the conditional statement.\n\nHowever, we can use the second premise to derive the conclusion. Since the second premise states that the unicorn was not in the forest, we can use this to conclude that the first part of the conditional statement (the griffin was in the forest) must be false, because if it were true, the second part of the conditional statement (the unicorn was in the forest) would also be true, which contradicts the second premise.\n\nThis is an example of a modus tollens argument, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: If P -> Q, and not Q, then not P.\n\nAnswer: yes",
