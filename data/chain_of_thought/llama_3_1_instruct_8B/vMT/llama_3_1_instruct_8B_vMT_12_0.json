            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional argument, which has the form 'If P, then Q' and 'not Q', and concludes 'not P'. This is known as modus tollens, a valid form of argument in logic.\n\nIn this case, the first premise is 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo', which can be represented as 'P \u2192 Q'. The second premise is 'Lucy did not go to the zoo', which is 'not Q'. The conclusion is 'Joe did not go to the park', which is 'not P'.\n\nThe argument follows the modus tollens form, where if the condition (Q) is false, then the conclusion (P) must also be false. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
