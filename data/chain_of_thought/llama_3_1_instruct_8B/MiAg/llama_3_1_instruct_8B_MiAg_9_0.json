The first statement 'The package might be delivered today' implies that there is a possibility of the package being delivered on the current day. The second statement 'The package might be damaged' implies that there is a possibility of the package being damaged. \n\nHowever, the two statements do not provide any direct information about the package being delivered damaged on the same day. The first statement does not specify the condition of the package upon delivery, and the second statement does not specify the timing of the damage. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that the package will be delivered damaged today based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
