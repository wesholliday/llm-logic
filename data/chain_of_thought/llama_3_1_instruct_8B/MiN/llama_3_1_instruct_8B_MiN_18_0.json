            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer' from 'The notebook might not be in the drawer', we need to understand the meaning of the words 'might' and 'must'. 'Might' implies a possibility, while 'must' implies necessity or certainty. The statement 'The notebook might not be in the drawer' suggests that there is a possibility that the notebook is not in the drawer, but it does not rule out the possibility that it is in the drawer. \n\nHowever, 'It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer' implies that there is no necessity or certainty that the notebook is in the drawer. This statement is equivalent to saying that it is possible that the notebook is not in the drawer, which is the same as the original statement 'The notebook might not be in the drawer'. \n\nTherefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer' from 'The notebook might not be in the drawer' because both statements convey the same idea of possibility.",
