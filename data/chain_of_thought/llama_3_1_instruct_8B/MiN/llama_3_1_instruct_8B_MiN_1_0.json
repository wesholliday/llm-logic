            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding' from 'Mary might not have been at the wedding', we need to understand the meaning of the words 'might' and 'must'. 'Might' implies a possibility, while 'must' implies necessity or certainty. The statement 'Mary might not have been at the wedding' suggests that there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding, but it does not rule out the possibility that she was at the wedding. \n\nHowever, 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding' implies that it is not necessary for Mary to have been at the wedding, which is a stronger statement than 'Mary might not have been at the wedding'. The first statement only rules out the necessity of Mary's presence, but does not necessarily imply that she was not there. \n\nTherefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding' from 'Mary might not have been at the wedding' because both statements convey a lack of necessity, but the first statement is a weaker assertion than the second.\n\nAnswer: yes",
