            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza' from 'Sue might not have chosen pizza', let's break down the meaning of the given statement and the statement we're trying to infer.\n\n'Sue might not have chosen pizza' is a statement that expresses a possibility. It indicates that there is a chance that Sue did not choose pizza, but it does not rule out the possibility that she might have chosen pizza. This statement is an example of a non-modal or non-necessity statement, which is different from a statement that expresses necessity or a must.\n\nOn the other hand, 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza' is a statement that expresses a negation of necessity. It implies that there is no requirement or obligation for Sue to have chosen pizza.\n\nGiven the difference in meaning between the two statements, we can see that 'Sue might not have chosen pizza' does not necessarily imply that Sue must not have chosen pizza. Instead, it leaves open the possibility that Sue might have chosen pizza. However, it does imply that it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza, because if Sue must have chosen pizza, then it would be impossible for her not to have chosen pizza, which contradicts the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
