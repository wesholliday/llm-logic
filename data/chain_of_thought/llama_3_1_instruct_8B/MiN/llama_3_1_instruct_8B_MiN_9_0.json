            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt' from 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt', let's break down the meaning of the given statement. 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt' is a statement that expresses possibility, indicating that there is a chance that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This does not necessarily mean that it is certain or guaranteed that she did not buy it, but rather that it is a possibility.\n\nThe statement 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt' is a negation of a necessity claim. It implies that there is no obligation or requirement for Lisa to have bought the red shirt. This statement is equivalent to saying that it is possible for Lisa not to have bought the red shirt.\n\nGiven the original statement 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt', we can see that it already implies a possibility of Lisa not buying the red shirt. This aligns with the meaning of 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt', which also expresses the possibility of Lisa not buying the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt' from 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt' because both statements convey the idea that there is a possibility of Lisa not buying the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
