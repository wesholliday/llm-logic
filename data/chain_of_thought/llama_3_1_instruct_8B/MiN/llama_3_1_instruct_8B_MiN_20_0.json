            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag' from 'The sunglasses might not be in her bag', we need to understand the meaning of the modal verb 'might'. The phrase 'might not be in her bag' indicates a possibility, but not a necessity. It suggests that there is a chance the sunglasses are not in her bag, but it does not rule out the possibility that they are in her bag. This is a statement of possibility, not a statement of necessity. Therefore, we can infer that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag, because the original statement does not imply a requirement or a necessity.\n\nAnswer: yes",
