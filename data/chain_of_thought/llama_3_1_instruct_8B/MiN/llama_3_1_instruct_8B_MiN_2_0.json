            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest' from 'The griffin might not have been in the forest', we need to understand the meaning of the words 'might' and 'must'. 'Might' implies a possibility, while 'must' implies necessity or certainty. The statement 'The griffin might not have been in the forest' suggests that it is possible that the griffin was not in the forest, but it does not rule out the possibility that the griffin was in the forest. \n\nNow, 'It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest' is equivalent to saying 'It is possible that the griffin was not in the forest'. This is because 'must' implies necessity, and if we negate it, we get the possibility of the opposite. \n\nSince 'The griffin might not have been in the forest' already implies a possibility that the griffin was not in the forest, we can infer that it is possible the griffin was not in the forest, which is equivalent to saying 'It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
