            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument has two premises and a conclusion. The first premise is 'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden', which is a disjunction (OR statement). The second premise is 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden', which is a negation of the second part of the disjunction. The conclusion is 'Fido is inside', which is one of the two parts of the disjunction.\n\nTo evaluate the argument's validity, we can use a truth table or analyze it step by step. If we negate the conclusion, we get 'Fido is not inside'. If we negate the first premise, we get 'It's not the case that Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden', which is equivalent to 'Fido is not inside and Fido is not in the garden'. If we negate the second premise, we get 'Fido must be in the garden'. \n\nNow, if we combine the negation of the conclusion with the negation of the second premise, we get 'Fido is not inside and Fido must be in the garden'. This is a contradiction, which means that the argument is valid. The argument's form is: \n\n1. P or Q\n2. Not Q\n3. Therefore, P\n\nThis is a valid form of argument, known as Disjunctive Syllogism.",
