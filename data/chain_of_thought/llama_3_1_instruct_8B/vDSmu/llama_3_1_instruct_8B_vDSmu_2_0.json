            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a disjunctive syllogism, which is a form of argument that uses a disjunction (either/or) in one of its premises. In this case, the first premise is a disjunction: 'Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table'. The second premise is a negation of one of the disjuncts: 'It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table'. \n\nTo be logically valid, the argument must follow the rule that if one of the disjuncts is negated, the other disjunct must be affirmed. In this case, if 'it must be resting on the table' is negated, then 'the book is on the shelf' must be affirmed. This is because the two disjuncts are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that one and only one of them can be true at the same time.\n\nHowever, the conclusion 'The book is on the shelf' is not necessarily true just because the other option is false. The conclusion is not logically entailed by the premises. The argument is actually an example of a fallacy called 'denying the antecedent', which is a type of logical fallacy where the conclusion is drawn from a negated premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
