'Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer' is a disjunction, which means it is one of the two options that must be true. This statement can be represented as: (A \u2228 B), where A is 'the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand' and B is 'the notebook is in the drawer'.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand' can be represented as \u00acA, where \u00ac is the negation operator.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that B (the notebook is in the drawer) must be true because if A (the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand) is false, then the only remaining option is B.\n\nAnswer: yes",
