The first statement is 'Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag'. This is a disjunction, which means it is true if at least one of the options is true. It can be represented as P \u2228 Q, where P is 'the pen is on my desk' and Q is 'the pen is in my bag'.\n\n2. The second statement is 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk'. This can be represented as \u00acP, where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\n3. From the second statement, we know that P is false. This is because if P were true, then the second statement would be false, which contradicts the given information.\n\n4. Since P is false, we can use the first statement to determine the truth of Q. The first statement is a disjunction, and since P is false, Q must be true for the disjunction to be true.\n\n5. Therefore, we can infer that 'The pen is in my bag' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
