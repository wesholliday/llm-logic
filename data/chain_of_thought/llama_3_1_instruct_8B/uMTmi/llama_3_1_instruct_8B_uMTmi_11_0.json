The first statement says that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry. This is a conditional statement, which means that it only provides information about the relationship between the cake and the muffins under the condition that the cake is chocolate. It does not provide any information about the color of the muffins if the cake is not chocolate.\n\nThe second statement says that the muffins might not have been blueberry. This statement is a separate piece of information that does not provide any direct connection to the color of the cake.\n\nTo infer that the cake was not chocolate, we would need a statement that directly contradicts the first statement or provides information that the cake is not chocolate. However, the given statements do not provide any such information.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
