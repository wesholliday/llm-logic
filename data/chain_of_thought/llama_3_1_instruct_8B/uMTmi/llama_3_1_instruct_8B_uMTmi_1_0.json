            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" implies a conditional relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence. This means that if Mary is at the wedding, Sue must also be there, but it does not necessarily mean that if Sue is not at the wedding, Mary is not there. The second statement \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\" suggests that Sue's presence is not guaranteed, but it does not provide any information about Mary's presence. \n\nGiven this information, we cannot conclude that Mary was not at the wedding because the conditional relationship only goes one way (Mary's presence implies Sue's presence, but Sue's absence does not imply Mary's absence). Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
