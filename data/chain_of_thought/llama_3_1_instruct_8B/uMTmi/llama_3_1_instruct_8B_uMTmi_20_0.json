            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that the apple was not red, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement, \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow,\" is a conditional statement. It implies that if the apple is red, the banana has to be yellow, but it does not say anything about the color of the banana if the apple is not red. The second statement, \"The banana might not have been yellow,\" suggests that the banana's color is not certain and could be different from yellow.\n\nGiven these statements, we cannot directly conclude that the apple was not red. The first statement only provides a condition under which the banana is yellow, but it does not provide any information about the apple's color when the banana is not yellow. The second statement only suggests uncertainty about the banana's color, which does not provide any information about the apple's color.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the apple was not red based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
