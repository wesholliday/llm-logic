            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument involving the concept of modus tollens. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: if P implies Q, and not Q, then not P. In this case, we have two statements: \n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel (P implies Q).\n2. The book might not be a mystery novel (not Q).\n\nWe can apply the rule of modus tollens to conclude that if the book might not be a mystery novel, then it is not the case that the book was written by James. This is because if the book being a mystery novel is a necessary condition for it being written by James, then the book not being a mystery novel is a sufficient condition for it not being written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
