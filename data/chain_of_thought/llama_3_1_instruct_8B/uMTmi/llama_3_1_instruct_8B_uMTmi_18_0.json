            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument involving modus tollens, a form of deductive reasoning. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: if P then Q, and not Q, then not P. In this case, the statements can be translated as follows: \n\n- If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal (P -> Q).\n- The truck might not have been metal (not Q).\n\nWe are trying to determine if we can infer that the doll was not plastic (not P).\n\nTo apply modus tollens, we need to check if the first statement is a conditional statement (if P then Q) and if the second statement is the negation of Q. In this case, the first statement is a conditional statement, but the second statement is not the negation of Q, it's a possibility that Q is not true. However, we can still use the information given to infer that the doll might not be plastic.\n\nHowever, we can't be certain that the doll was not plastic because the first statement is not a universal statement (it's a must), it's a conditional statement. The first statement only tells us that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal, but it doesn't tell us that the truck is metal if the doll is plastic. Therefore, we can't be certain that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: no",
