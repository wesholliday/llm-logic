            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical inference problem involving the concept of causality and the direction of implication. The given statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement, where the presence of Mary at the wedding is the condition (antecedent) and Sue's presence at the wedding is the consequence (consequent). This statement implies that Mary's presence is a necessary condition for Sue's presence at the wedding.\n\nHowever, the question asks if we can infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding. This is a different conditional statement, where the presence of Sue at the wedding is the condition (antecedent) and Mary's presence is the consequence (consequent). This is not necessarily true, as there could be other reasons why Sue was at the wedding that do not involve Mary's presence.\n\nFor example, Sue might have been invited separately from Mary, or Sue might have been a member of the wedding party or a guest of the groom. In these cases, Sue's presence at the wedding would not imply Mary's presence. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
