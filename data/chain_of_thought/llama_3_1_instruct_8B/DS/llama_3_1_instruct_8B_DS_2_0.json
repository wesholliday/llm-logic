            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The book is on the shelf', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table' presents two possibilities for the book's location. The second statement 'The book isn't resting on the table' eliminates one of the possibilities, which is resting on the table. \n\nSince the book can't be resting on the table, we are left with the only other possibility, which is that the book is on the shelf. This is a classic example of a disjunctive syllogism, where we have two mutually exclusive possibilities, and one of them is eliminated, leading to the conclusion of the other.\n\nAnswer: yes",
