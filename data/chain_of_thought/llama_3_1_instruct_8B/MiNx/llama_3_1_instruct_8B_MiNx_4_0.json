            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled' from 'The fribble might not have been snurgled', we need to understand the meaning of the words 'might' and 'must'. 'Might' is a modal verb that indicates possibility, while 'must' is a modal verb that indicates necessity. \n\nThe statement 'The fribble might not have been snurgled' suggests that it is possible that the fribble was not snurgled. However, it does not necessarily mean that the fribble was not snurgled. It only indicates that there is a possibility of it not being snurgled.\n\nOn the other hand, 'It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled' suggests that it is not necessary for the fribble to have been snurgled. This statement is equivalent to saying that it is possible for the fribble not to have been snurgled.\n\nSince 'The fribble might not have been snurgled' already implies that it is possible for the fribble not to have been snurgled, we can infer that 'It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled' is indeed true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
