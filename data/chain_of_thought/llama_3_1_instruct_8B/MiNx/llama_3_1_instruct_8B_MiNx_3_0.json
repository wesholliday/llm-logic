            "content": "Explanation: To infer 'It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed' from 'The splat might not have been morphed', we need to understand the meaning of the modal words 'might' and 'must'. 'Might' is a modal of possibility, indicating that something is possible but not necessarily true. On the other hand, 'must' is a modal of necessity, indicating that something is necessary or unavoidable.\n\nThe statement 'The splat might not have been morphed' suggests that it is possible that the splat was not morphed. This does not necessarily mean that the splat was not morphed, but rather that there is a possibility that it was not morphed.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement 'It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed'. This statement is equivalent to saying that it is not necessary that the splat was morphed. If the splat might not have been morphed, then it is not necessary that it was morphed, because there is a possibility that it was not morphed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed' from 'The splat might not have been morphed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
