            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'It's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled' from 'The sneg might not have been crampled', we need to understand the meaning of the words 'might' and 'must'. 'Might' is a modal verb that indicates possibility, while 'must' is a modal verb that indicates necessity. \n\nThe statement 'The sneg might not have been crampled' suggests that there is a possibility that the sneg was not crampled. However, it does not rule out the possibility that the sneg was crampled. \n\nOn the other hand, 'It's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled' suggests that there is no necessity for the sneg to have been crampled. \n\nSince 'The sneg might not have been crampled' does not necessarily imply that the sneg must not have been crampled, but rather leaves open the possibility that it might have been crampled, we cannot directly infer 'It's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled' from the given statement.\n\nHowever, we can infer the opposite: 'It's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled' is logically equivalent to 'The sneg might not have been crampled'.",
