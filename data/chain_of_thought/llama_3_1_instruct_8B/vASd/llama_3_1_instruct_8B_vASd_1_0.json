            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement, where the premise is 'If the match is struck, then it will light' and the conclusion is 'If the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, then it will light'. \n\nThe conclusion adds an additional condition to the premise, which is 'it has been soaked in water'. This new condition is not present in the premise, but it is added to the premise in the conclusion. In order to determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the addition of this new condition affects the truth of the conclusion.\n\nIn this case, the premise states that if the match is struck, it will light. However, the conclusion adds the condition that the match has been soaked in water, which is a condition that would prevent the match from lighting. This means that the conclusion is not necessarily true even if the premise is true. \n\nFor example, if the match is struck but has been soaked in water, it will not light. Therefore, the addition of the condition 'it has been soaked in water' in the conclusion changes the truth value of the conclusion, making it not necessarily true.\n\nHowever, the argument is still logically valid because the conclusion is a more specific case of the premise. The premise states that if the match is struck, it will light, and the conclusion states that if the match is struck and it has been soaked in water, it will light. The conclusion is a more specific case of the premise because it adds a condition that is already present in the premise. \n\nIn this case, the argument is an example of a syllogism, specifically a form of modus ponens, where the conclusion is a more specific case of the premise. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
