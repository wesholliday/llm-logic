            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement, where the premise is 'If we go to the concert, then we'll have a good time' and the conclusion is 'If we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time'. \n\nThe conclusion adds an additional condition 'a bomb goes off' to the premise, which is not present in the original premise. This is an example of a fallacy known as 'undistributed middle' or 'affirming the consequent', where the conclusion is trying to infer a new condition from the original premise. \n\nIn this case, the original premise does not guarantee that we'll have a good time under all circumstances, especially if a bomb goes off. The presence of a bomb would likely ruin the concert experience, making the conclusion false even if the premise is true. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
