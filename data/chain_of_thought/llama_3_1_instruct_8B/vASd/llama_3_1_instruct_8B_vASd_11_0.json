            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement, where the premise is 'If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired' and the conclusion is 'If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired'. \n\nThe conclusion adds an additional condition 'do hard labor' to the premise, which is not present in the original premise. This is a classic example of adding a new condition to the premise, which is not logically equivalent to the original premise. \n\nIn logic, this type of argument is known as 'affirming the consequent', which is a fallacy. The original premise only guarantees that getting enough sleep will prevent tiredness, but it does not guarantee that doing hard labor will not cause tiredness. Therefore, the conclusion is not logically valid based on the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
