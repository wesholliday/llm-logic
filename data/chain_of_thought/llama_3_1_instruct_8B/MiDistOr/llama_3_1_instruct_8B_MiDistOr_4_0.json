            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'The meeting might start at 2 PM or be cancelled' implies that there are two possible outcomes for the meeting: it either starts at 2 PM or it gets cancelled. The word 'or' is used to indicate an alternative, and in this context, it suggests that these two options are mutually exclusive. The statement does not imply that the meeting might start at 2 PM and also be cancelled at the same time. Therefore, we can infer that the meeting might start at 2 PM or it might be cancelled, but not both simultaneously.\n\nAnswer: yes",
