            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'The document might be signed or notarized' implies that the document has two possible states: it might be signed, or it might be notarized. However, it does not explicitly exclude the possibility of the document being both signed and notarized at the same time. The word 'or' in this context is used to indicate alternatives, but it does not necessarily mean that the two options are mutually exclusive. Therefore, we can infer that the document might indeed be signed or it might be notarized, but we cannot rule out the possibility of it being both.\n\nAnswer: yes",
