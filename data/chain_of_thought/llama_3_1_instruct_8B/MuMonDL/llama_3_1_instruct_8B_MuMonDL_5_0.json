            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The package must have been delivered today or tomorrow', we need to analyze the given statement 'The package must have been delivered today'. This statement implies that the delivery of the package occurred on the current day, with no mention of any other possible days. The word 'must' indicates a necessity or a requirement, suggesting that the delivery is expected to have taken place on the current day. However, it does not provide any information about the possibility of the package being delivered on the next day. Therefore, we cannot infer that the package must have been delivered today or tomorrow, as the statement only specifies the current day.\n\nAnswer: no",
