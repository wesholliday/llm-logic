            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The contract must have been valid for a year or longer' from 'The contract must have been valid for a year', we need to analyze the meaning of the original statement. The phrase 'for a year' implies a specific duration, which is one year. It does not include any additional time beyond that. The word 'for' typically indicates a range that starts from the beginning of the duration and ends at the end of it, but it does not extend beyond that point. Therefore, the original statement does not imply that the contract must have been valid for more than a year; it only specifies that it must have been valid for exactly one year.\n\nAnswer: no",
