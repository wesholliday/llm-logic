It does not provide any information about the project's status after Friday. Therefore, we cannot infer that the project must have been completed by Friday or next week, as the statement does not include any information about the project's completion status for the following week. The statement only provides a specific deadline, which is Friday, and does not extend it to the next week.\n\nAnswer: no",
