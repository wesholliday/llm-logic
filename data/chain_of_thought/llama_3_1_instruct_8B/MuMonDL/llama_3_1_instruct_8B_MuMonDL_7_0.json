It implies that the speaker believes the exam was challenging, but it does not provide any objective evidence or facts to support this claim. However, the word 'difficult' is a synonym for 'challenging', and in this context, it is used to describe the speaker's subjective experience or perception of the exam. Therefore, we can infer that the speaker believes the exam was indeed challenging, as 'difficult' and 'challenging' convey a similar meaning.\n\nAnswer: yes",
