However, it does not necessarily imply that the application was submitted electronically. The application could have been completed online but then printed and submitted in a physical form. The key word 'completed' suggests the process of filling out the application, not the method of submission. Therefore, we cannot infer that the application must have been submitted electronically.\n\nAnswer: no",
