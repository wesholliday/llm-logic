The statement 'The flight must have been delayed' implies that the flight was indeed delayed, but it doesn't provide any information about whether the flight was rescheduled or not. Rescheduling is a separate action that might or might not have occurred in addition to the delay. Since the statement only mentions delay and doesn't provide any information about rescheduling, we cannot infer that the flight must have been rescheduled.\n\nAnswer: no",
