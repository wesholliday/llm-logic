            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The event must have been formal or black-tie' from 'The event must have been formal', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. 'Formal' is a broader term that encompasses various levels of formality, including black-tie events. Black-tie events are a specific type of formal event, typically characterized by a tuxedo for men and a formal gown for women. Since 'formal' is a more general term that includes black-tie events, we can infer that if an event is formal, it could also be black-tie, but not necessarily the other way around. However, the original statement does not provide enough information to rule out other types of formal events that are not black-tie. Therefore, we can make a weaker inference that the event might be black-tie, but it's not a definitive conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
