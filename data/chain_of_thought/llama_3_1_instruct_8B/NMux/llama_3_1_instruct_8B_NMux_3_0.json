'It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed' is a negation of a necessity claim. This means that the original statement 'The splat must have been morphed' is false. \n\nThe original statement 'The splat must have been morphed' implies that it is necessary for the splat to have been morphed. However, the negation of this statement does not necessarily imply that it is possible for the splat not to have been morphed. It only implies that it is not necessary for the splat to have been morphed.\n\nIn other words, the original statement is saying that it is required or necessary for the splat to have been morphed. The negation of this statement is saying that this requirement is not met, but it does not provide any information about the possibility of the splat not being morphed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The splat might not have been morphed' from 'It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed', because the negation of necessity does not imply possibility.\n\nAnswer: no",
