'It's not the case that the shank must have been plooked' is a negation of a necessity statement. This means that the original statement 'The shank must have been plooked' is false. \n\nA necessity statement implies that something is true in all possible worlds or scenarios. If the original statement is false, it means that there is at least one possible world or scenario where the shank has not been plooked. \n\nThe statement 'The shank might not have been plooked' is a possibility statement, which means that there is at least one possible world or scenario where the shank has not been plooked. \n\nSince the negation of a necessity statement implies the possibility of the negation of the original statement, we can infer that 'The shank might not have been plooked' from 'It's not the case that the shank must have been plooked'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
