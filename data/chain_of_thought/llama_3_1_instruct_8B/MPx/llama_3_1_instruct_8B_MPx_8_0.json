            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The sprocket was daggled' from the given statements, we need to analyze the relationship between 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled' and 'The sprocket was cranked'. \n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the sprocket was cranked) is met, then the consequence (the sprocket was daggled) will follow. This is a classic example of a 'if-then' or 'material implication' statement.\n\nThe second statement, 'The sprocket was cranked', is a simple statement that asserts the condition of the first statement.\n\nNow, if the condition (the sprocket was cranked) is true, then the consequence (the sprocket was daggled) must also be true according to the first statement. Since we know that the sprocket was cranked (from the second statement), we can conclude that the sprocket was daggled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The sprocket was daggled' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
