            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The dreb was not spened', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened'. This is a conditional statement, where 'vroombed' is the condition and 'spened' is the consequence. The second statement is 'The dreb was not vroombed'. \n\nTo infer 'The dreb was not spened', we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. Since the first statement is a conditional, we can use the rule of contrapositive to analyze it. The contrapositive of 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. In this case, the contrapositive of the first statement would be 'If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed'.\n\nNow, we can use the second statement 'The dreb was not vroombed' to apply the contrapositive. If the dreb was not vroombed, then it implies that the dreb was not spened (by the contrapositive of the first statement). However, this is not the same as saying the dreb was not spened. The contrapositive only tells us that if the dreb was not spened, then it was not vroombed, but it does not tell us the opposite. \n\nHowever, we can use the first statement to infer that if the dreb was spened, then it was vroombed. Since we know the dreb was not vroombed, we can conclude that the dreb was not spened. This is because if the dreb was spened, it would imply that it was vroombed, but we know that is not the case. Therefore, the dreb must not have been spened.\n\nAnswer: yes",
