            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The sprocket was not daggled', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled'. This is a conditional statement, which means if the condition (the sprocket was cranked) is met, then the consequence (the sprocket was daggled) will follow. However, the second statement 'The sprocket was not cranked' tells us that the condition (the sprocket was cranked) is not met.\n\nSince the condition is not met, we cannot conclude that the consequence (the sprocket was daggled) will occur. In fact, we can conclude that the consequence (the sprocket was daggled) will not occur because the condition (the sprocket was cranked) is not met. This is an example of a contrapositive relationship, where if the condition is not met, then the consequence will not occur.\n\nAnswer: yes",
