This is a conditional statement, where 'skizzled' is the condition and 'movated' is the consequence. It implies that if the flob is skizzled, it will movate.\n\nThe second statement is 'The flob was not skizzled'. This is a simple statement stating that the flob does not have the property of being skizzled.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can conclude that the flob was not movated. To do this, we need to see if the condition (skizzled) is met, and if not, we can infer the consequence (movated) is also not met.\n\nSince we know the flob was not skizzled, we can use the first statement to infer that the flob did not movate. This is because the condition (skizzled) is not met, so the consequence (movated) cannot be inferred.\n\nAnswer: yes",
