'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned'\n2. 'The fleeg was not bluttered'\n\nFrom the first statement, we can establish a conditional relationship between 'bluttered' and 'surned'. This means that if the fleeg is bluttered, it will surn. However, this does not imply that if the fleeg is not bluttered, it will not surn.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the fleeg was not bluttered. This directly contradicts the condition in the first statement, which implies that the fleeg would surn if it was bluttered.\n\nHowever, we cannot directly infer that the fleeg did not surn from the given statements. The first statement only establishes a conditional relationship, and the second statement only negates the condition, not the consequence. Therefore, we cannot be certain about the outcome of 'surned' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
