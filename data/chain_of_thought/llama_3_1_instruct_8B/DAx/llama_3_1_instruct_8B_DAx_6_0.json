            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The grommet did not plop the frink', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink' is a conditional statement. It implies that if the grommet was sploffed, it would lead to the grommet plopping the frink. However, it does not state that the grommet was sploffed, so we cannot directly conclude that the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nThe second statement 'The grommet was not sploffed' directly contradicts the condition in the first statement. Since the condition for the grommet to plop the frink (being sploffed) is not met, we can conclude that the grommet did not plop the frink.\n\nAnswer: yes",
