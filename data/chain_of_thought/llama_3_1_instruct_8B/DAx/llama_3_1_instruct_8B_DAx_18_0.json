            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The shank was not nugged', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged'. This is a conditional statement, where 'plooked' is the condition and 'nugged' is the consequence. The second statement is 'The shank was not plooked'. \n\nTo infer 'The shank was not nugged', we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. Since the first statement is a conditional, we can use the rule of contrapositive. The contrapositive of 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. In this case, the contrapositive of the first statement would be 'If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked'.\n\nHowever, we are given that 'The shank was not plooked', not 'The shank was nugged'. We can use the rule of modus tollens, which states that if we have 'If A, then B' and 'not B', then we can conclude 'not A'. In this case, we have 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged' and 'The shank was not plooked'. \n\nUsing modus tollens, we can conclude that 'The shank was not plooked' implies 'The shank was not nugged' is not directly applicable, but we can use the first statement to infer that if the shank was not plooked, then it does not necessarily mean the shank was not nugged. However, we can use the first statement to infer that if the shank was nugged, then it must have been plooked. Since we know the shank was not plooked, we can infer that the shank was not nugged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
