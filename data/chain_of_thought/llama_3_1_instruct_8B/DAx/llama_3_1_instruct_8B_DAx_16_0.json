            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The sneg did not sprot the frink', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink'. This is a conditional statement, where 'if-then' relationship is established between 'crampled' and 'sproted'. The second statement is 'The sneg was not crampled', which is a negation of the condition in the first statement.\n\nUsing the principle of modus tollens, a rule of inference in logic, we can conclude that if the condition (crampled) is not met, then the consequence (sproted) cannot be inferred. Therefore, we can logically deduce that if the sneg was not crampled, then we cannot conclude that the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nHowever, the question is asking if we can infer 'The sneg did not sprot the frink'. Since we cannot conclude that the sneg sproted the frink from the given statements, we can logically infer that we cannot conclude that the sneg did not sprot the frink either. The absence of evidence does not necessarily imply the presence of the negation of the evidence. In other words, we cannot rule out the possibility that the sneg sproted the frink, even though we cannot conclude it.\n\nHowever, we can use the principle of modus tollens in reverse to infer that if the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg must have been crampled. Since we know the sneg was not crampled, we can infer that the sneg did not sprot the frink.\n\nAnswer: yes",
