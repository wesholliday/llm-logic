            "content": "Explanation: To infer that 'The application might be completed online and include references', we need to analyze the given statement 'The application might include references'. The word 'application' is a general term that can refer to any process of submitting information or a request for something, such as a job, a loan, or a college admission. The phrase 'might include references' suggests that the application may or may not require references, but it does not specify the method of submission. However, when we consider the context of modern applications, especially in the digital age, it's common for applications to be submitted online. Therefore, it's reasonable to infer that the application might be completed online, as it's a common practice in many contexts. This inference is based on the assumption that the application is likely to be a digital one, given the mention of 'might include references', which is a common requirement in digital applications.\n\nAnswer: yes",
