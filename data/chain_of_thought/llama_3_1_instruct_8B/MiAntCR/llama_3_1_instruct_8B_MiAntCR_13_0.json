However, it does not necessarily mean that the movie is in English. It could be in any language that the viewer does not understand, and subtitles are added to make it more accessible. Therefore, we cannot infer that the movie is in English and have subtitles, as the language of the movie could be any language other than English.\n\nAnswer: no",
