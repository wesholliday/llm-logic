            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The document must have been notarized' from 'The document must have been signed and notarized', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. The phrase 'and' is a conjunction that indicates both conditions must be met for the entire statement to be true. Since 'signed' is a condition that can be met without 'notarized', we can't infer that 'notarized' is a necessary condition. However, we can infer that if the document was signed, it was likely notarized, but not necessarily the other way around. \n\nAnswer: no",
