            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The concert must have been sold out' provides information about the state of ticket availability for the concert, but it does not directly relate to the time at which the concert started. The phrase 'started at 8 PM' is a specific piece of information that directly states the time of the concert's beginning. The two pieces of information are independent of each other, and the fact that the concert was sold out does not necessarily imply that it started at 8 PM. It could have started at any time, and the fact that it was sold out is a separate piece of information that does not provide any direct connection to the time of the concert's start.\n\nAnswer: no",
