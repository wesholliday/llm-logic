            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The package must have been signed for' from 'The package must have been delivered today and signed for', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. The phrase 'and' is a conjunction that indicates a logical conjunction, meaning both statements must be true for the entire statement to be true. 'The package must have been delivered today' is a condition that must be met, and 'signed for' is the consequence of that condition. \n\nSince 'and' is used, both conditions must be met for the entire statement to be true. Therefore, if 'The package must have been delivered today and signed for' is true, it implies that 'The package must have been signed for' is also true, as it is a part of the conjunction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
