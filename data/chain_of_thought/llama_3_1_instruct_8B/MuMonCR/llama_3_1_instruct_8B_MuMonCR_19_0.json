The statement 'The application must have been completed online' provides information about the method of completing the application, but it doesn't directly relate to the inclusion of references. However, the second part of the statement, 'included references', directly states that the application must have included references. \n\nSince the second part of the statement directly states the requirement for the application, we can infer that the application indeed included references, regardless of the method used to complete it. The first part of the statement, 'The application must have been completed online', is not necessary to infer the inclusion of references. \n\nAnswer: yes",
