            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The event must have required tickets' from 'The event must have been formal and required tickets', we need to analyze the given statement. The phrase 'required tickets' is a subset of the phrase 'must have been formal and required tickets'. This is because 'must have been formal and required tickets' implies that the event had two characteristics: it was formal and it required tickets. Since 'required tickets' is one of the characteristics, it is a part of the original statement. Therefore, we can logically infer that 'The event must have required tickets' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
