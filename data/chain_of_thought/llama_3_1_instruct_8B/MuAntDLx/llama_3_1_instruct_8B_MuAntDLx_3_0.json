The original statement is 'The floob must be in the glorp or on the wibble'. This statement contains a disjunction, which means it presents two possibilities: either the floob is in the glorp or it is on the wibble. \n\nHowever, the statement does not provide any information that would allow us to conclude that the floob is definitely in the glorp. It only presents two options, and we cannot rule out the possibility that the floob is actually on the wibble. Therefore, we cannot infer that the floob must be in the glorp.\n\nAnswer: no",
