            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The contract might be legally binding' from 'The contract might be legally binding and have hidden clauses', let's break down the statement. The phrase 'might be legally binding' is already present in the original statement, which directly conveys the idea that the contract has the potential to be legally enforceable. The addition of 'and have hidden clauses' provides more information about the contract, but it doesn't change the fact that the contract 'might be legally binding'. The presence of hidden clauses is a characteristic of the contract, but it doesn't negate the possibility of the contract being legally binding. Therefore, the information in the original statement is sufficient to infer that 'The contract might be legally binding'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
