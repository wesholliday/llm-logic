The phrase 'might be successful' is already present in the original statement, which means it's explicitly mentioned. The addition of 'and yield groundbreaking results' provides more information about the potential outcome of the experiment, but it doesn't change the fact that the experiment 'might be successful'. The word 'might' indicates uncertainty, and the phrase 'yield groundbreaking results' is an additional condition that could be met if the experiment is successful. Therefore, the original statement already contains the information that the experiment 'might be successful', and the additional phrase doesn't add any new information to this part of the statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
