            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The election might be close' from 'The election might be close and require a recount', let's break down the statement. The phrase 'might be close' is already present in the given statement, which directly conveys the idea that the election is uncertain or has a possibility of being close. The addition of 'and require a recount' provides further context, implying that the closeness of the election is significant enough to warrant a recount. This suggests that the closeness of the election is not just a possibility, but a reality that necessitates a recount. Therefore, the presence of 'might be close' in the statement already conveys the idea that the election is close, and the additional information about the recount reinforces this idea.\n\nAnswer: yes",
