            "content": "Explanation: To determine the validity of the argument, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement, where the premise is 'Mary might not have been at the wedding' and the conclusion is 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding'. \n\nThe key to understanding this argument is to recognize that 'might not' and 'must not' are related but distinct concepts. 'Might not' implies a possibility, while 'must not' implies a necessity. The premise 'Mary might not have been at the wedding' suggests that there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding, but it does not rule out the possibility that she was at the wedding. \n\nThe conclusion 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding' is equivalent to saying 'Mary might not have been at the wedding'. This is because if Mary must have been at the wedding, then it would be impossible for her not to have been there, which contradicts the premise. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
