            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can logically deduce 'The doll was plastic' from the given statements, we need to analyze the given statements and apply the rules of logical deduction.\n\nThe first statement is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'. This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P is 'The doll was plastic' and Q is 'The truck was metal'.\n\nThe second statement is 'The truck was metal'. This is a simple statement that directly states the condition Q.\n\nTo deduce 'The doll was plastic', we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. Since the second statement directly states the condition Q, we can use the first statement to find the corresponding condition P.\n\nIn a conditional statement P \u2192 Q, if Q is true, then P must also be true. Therefore, since we know the truck was metal (Q is true), we can logically deduce that the doll was plastic (P is true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
