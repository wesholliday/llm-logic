            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument involving modus ponens, a form of deductive reasoning. Modus ponens is a rule of inference that states: if P \u2192 Q and P, then we can conclude Q. In this case, 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is the conditional statement (P \u2192 Q), and 'Sue was at the wedding' is the premise (P). We are trying to deduce 'Mary was at the wedding' (Q).\n\nTo apply modus ponens, we need to check if the conditional statement is true and if the premise is true. If both conditions are met, we can logically conclude the conclusion. In this case, the conditional statement is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', which implies that if Mary is at the wedding, Sue must also be there. The premise is 'Sue was at the wedding', which is true. Therefore, we can logically deduce that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
