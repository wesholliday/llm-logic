            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional argument, which means it involves a conditional statement (if-then statement) and a negation of the consequent (the 'then' part of the conditional). The argument is as follows:\n\n1. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n2. It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\n3. Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nThe argument is trying to conclude that Jeff did not play basketball based on the fact that Amy did not have to play tennis. To determine if this is a valid form of argument, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) is true, then the consequent (Amy must have played tennis) must also be true. The second premise is a negation of the consequent, which means that Amy did not have to play tennis.\n\nThe conclusion, however, is a negation of the antecedent (Jeff did not play basketball). To determine if this conclusion logically follows from the premises, we need to see if the negation of the consequent (Amy did not have to play tennis) necessarily implies the negation of the antecedent (Jeff did not play basketball).\n\nIn this case, the argument is using a form of reasoning called modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens states that if P implies Q, and not Q, then not P. In this case, the argument is saying that if Jeff playing basketball implies Amy playing tennis, and Amy did not have to play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
