            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a form of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. However, in this case, the argument is not a straightforward modus tollens because the second premise is a negation of the conclusion of the first premise, rather than the negation of the antecedent.\n\nThe first premise is 'If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel'. This is a conditional statement, where 'if-then' is the relationship between the antecedent (the book was written by James) and the consequent (the book must be a mystery novel).\n\nThe second premise is 'It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel', which is the negation of the consequent of the first premise.\n\nThe conclusion is 'The book was not written by James'.\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the second premise is the negation of the consequent of the first premise, which is a key characteristic of a valid argument form called 'modus tollens'. However, the argument is not a standard modus tollens because the second premise is not the negation of the antecedent, but rather the negation of the consequent.\n\nHowever, the argument can be seen as a form of 'denying the consequent', which is a valid form of argument. If the consequent of a conditional statement is denied, then the antecedent can be denied as well. In this case, the argument is denying the consequent (the book must be a mystery novel) and using that to infer the negation of the antecedent (the book was written by James).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it follows the rules of logical reasoning, specifically the 'denying the consequent' form.\n\nAnswer: yes",
