            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a form of argument by contrapositive, where the conclusion is derived from the negation of the first premise. \n\nThe first premise is 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow'. This is a conditional statement, where 'if-then' is the main connective. The second premise is 'It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow', which is the negation of the second part of the first premise. \n\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The conclusion is 'The apple was not red'. \n\nIf the first premise is true, then the banana must have been yellow. However, the second premise states that it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow, which is a contradiction to the first premise. This means that the first premise cannot be true, and therefore, the apple cannot be red. \n\nThis is a form of modus tollens, a valid form of argument where if the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, then the consequent must also be false. In this case, the antecedent is 'the apple was red', and the consequent is 'the banana must have been yellow'. Since the consequent is false (as per the second premise), the antecedent must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
