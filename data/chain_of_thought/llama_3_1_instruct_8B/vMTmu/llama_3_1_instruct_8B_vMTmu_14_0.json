            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional argument, which means it involves a conditional statement (if-then statement) as one of its premises. The first premise is 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den'. This is a conditional statement where the antecedent (the condition) is 'the bear was in the cave' and the consequent (the outcome) is 'the wolf must have been in the den'.\n\nThe second premise is 'It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den', which is a negation of the consequent of the first premise. This premise is saying that the wolf not being in the den is a fact.\n\nThe conclusion is 'The bear was not in the cave'. This conclusion is the negation of the antecedent of the first premise.\n\nIn a valid argument, the conclusion must follow logically from the premises. In this case, the second premise directly negates the consequent of the first premise, which means that if the consequent is not true, then the antecedent cannot be true. This is a form of modus tollens, a valid form of argument in logic.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it follows the rules of modus tollens, where the negation of the consequent of a conditional statement leads to the negation of the antecedent.\n\nAnswer: yes",
