            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a form of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. However, the given argument is a bit more complex because it involves a conditional statement with a negated consequent. The first premise is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball', which can be represented as 'If A, then B'. The second premise is 'It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball', which can be represented as '~B'. The conclusion is 'Tom did not watch football', which can be represented as '~A'.\n\nTo check if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the argument is essentially saying: 'If A, then B' and '~B', therefore '~A'. This is a valid form of argument, as it follows the rules of modus tollens.\n\nHowever, we need to be careful because the first premise is not a straightforward 'If A, then B'. It's 'If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball'. This means that the argument is not a simple modus tollens, but rather a more complex argument that involves a conditional statement with a modal operator ('must have'). The key point is that the first premise implies that if Tom watched football, then Jen would have a necessity to watch basketball. The second premise then says that Jen does not have this necessity, which means that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
