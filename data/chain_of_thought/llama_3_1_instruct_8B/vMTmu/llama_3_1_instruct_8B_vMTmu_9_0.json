            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a syllogism with two premises and a conclusion. The first premise is a conditional statement, which can be broken down into two parts: the antecedent (if Lisa bought the red shirt) and the consequent (then Mark must have bought the blue shirt). The second premise is a negation of the consequent of the first premise. The conclusion is a negation of the antecedent of the first premise.\n\nTo evaluate the argument's validity, we can use a truth table or logical rules. However, in this case, we can analyze it more intuitively. If the first premise is true, it implies that Mark must have bought the blue shirt if Lisa bought the red shirt. The second premise states that it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt, which is a negation of the consequent of the first premise. This creates a contradiction, as the first premise implies that Mark must have bought the blue shirt, but the second premise says he didn't have to.\n\nThis contradiction suggests that the first premise must be false, as it leads to an inconsistency. If the first premise is false, then it's possible that Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, which aligns with the conclusion. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because it leads to a conclusion that is consistent with the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
