            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a form of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. However, in this case, the argument is not a straightforward modus tollens because the first premise is not a direct conditional statement. The first premise is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal', which is a contrapositive of the original modus tollens form. \n\nThe original modus tollens form would be: \n- If P, then Q\n- Not Q\n- Therefore, not P\n\nIn this case, the argument is: \n- If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\n- It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\n- Therefore, the doll was not plastic\n\nTo check if this argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The first premise is the contrapositive of the original modus tollens form, and the second premise is the negation of the consequent of the original modus tollens form. The conclusion is the negation of the antecedent of the original modus tollens form. \n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. The argument is using the contrapositive of the original modus tollens form, which is a valid form of argument. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
