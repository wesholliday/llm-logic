            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a form of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. However, in this case, the argument is not a straightforward modus tollens because the first premise is not a conditional statement that directly implies the conclusion. Instead, it's a conditional statement with a specific antecedent (the cake was chocolate) and a consequent (the muffins must have been blueberry).\n\nThe argument can be represented as:\n\n1. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\n2. It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\u2234 The cake was not chocolate.\n\nTo determine if this argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The first premise establishes a relationship between the cake being chocolate and the muffins being blueberry. The second premise negates the consequent of the first premise, which is the muffins being blueberry. However, the argument does not directly negate the antecedent (the cake being chocolate). \n\nThe argument is actually an example of a form of argument known as \"denying the consequent,\" which is a valid form of argument. Denying the consequent is a valid form of argument when the original conditional statement is of the form \"If A, then B\" and the argument is of the form \"If not B, then not A.\" However, in this case, the argument is not a direct application of this form because the original conditional statement is not of the form \"If A, then B\" but rather \"If A, then C\" where A is the cake being chocolate and C is the muffins being blueberry.\n\nHowever, the argument can be rephrased as: \n\n1. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\n2. The muffins were not blueberry.\n\u2234 The cake was not chocolate.\n\nThis rephrased argument is a valid application of the denying the consequent form of argument. \n\nAnswer: \nyes",
