            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional argument, which means it has a conditional statement as one of its premises. The conditional statement is 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake'. This can be represented as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the vampire was awake' and Q is 'the mummy must have been awake'.\n\nThe second premise is 'It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake', which can be represented as '~Q', where '~' denotes negation.\n\nThe conclusion is 'The vampire was not awake', which can be represented as '~P'.\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. We can use a truth table to analyze the argument.\n\n| P | Q | ~Q | If P, then Q | ~P |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| T | T | F | T | F |\n| T | F | T | F | F |\n| F | T | F | T | T |\n| F | F | T | T | T |\n\nIn the truth table, we can see that when Q is false (~Q is true), the conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is true regardless of the value of P. This is because a conditional statement is true whenever the antecedent (P) is false, regardless of the consequent (Q).\n\nHowever, the conclusion '~P' (The vampire was not awake) does not logically follow from the premises. The argument is trying to conclude that the vampire was not awake based on the fact that the mummy must not have been awake, but this does not logically follow from the conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
