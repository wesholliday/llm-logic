            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a syllogism with two premises and a conclusion. The first premise is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding', which is a conditional statement. The second premise is 'It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding', which is the negation of the consequent of the first premise. \n\nThe conclusion is 'Mary was not at the wedding'. To determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. \n\nIf the first premise is true, then the only way the second premise can be true is if the antecedent of the first premise (Mary was at the wedding) is false. This is because the second premise is the negation of the consequent of the first premise, and the only way to make the consequent false is to make the antecedent false. \n\nTherefore, if the first premise is true and the second premise is true, the conclusion (Mary was not at the wedding) must also be true. This means that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
