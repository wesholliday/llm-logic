            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The argument is a conditional argument, which means it involves a conditional statement (if-then statement) and a negation of the consequent (the 'then' part of the conditional statement).\n\nThe first premise is 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest'. This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent (the 'if' part) is 'the griffin was in the forest' and the consequent (the 'then' part) is 'the unicorn must have been in the forest'.\n\nThe second premise is 'It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest', which is a negation of the consequent of the first premise.\n\nThe conclusion is 'The griffin was not in the forest'.\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In this case, the second premise directly negates the consequent of the first premise. According to the rules of logical reasoning, if the consequent of a conditional statement is negated, then the entire conditional statement is negated. Therefore, if the consequent of the first premise is negated, it does not necessarily follow that the antecedent (the griffin being in the forest) is also negated.\n\nHowever, the argument is actually using a form of argument known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: if P \u2192 Q, and not Q, then not P. In this case, P is 'the griffin was in the forest', and Q is 'the unicorn must have been in the forest'. The argument is using modus tollens to conclude that if the consequent (the unicorn must have been in the forest) is negated, then the antecedent (the griffin was in the forest) must also be negated.\n\nAnswer: yes",
