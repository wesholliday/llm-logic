            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The sneg was not crampled' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink'. This is a conditional statement in the form 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the sneg was crampled' and Q is 'the sneg must have sproted the frink'.\n\nThe second statement is 'It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink'. This is a negation of the statement 'the sneg must have sproted the frink', which is the conclusion of the first statement.\n\nTo infer 'The sneg was not crampled', we need to show that the negation of the conclusion of the first statement (i.e., 'the sneg must have sproted the frink') implies the negation of the premise of the first statement (i.e., 'the sneg was crampled').\n\nUsing the rules of logical inference, we can apply the rule of contrapositive inference, which states that if 'If P, then Q' and 'not Q', then 'not P'. In this case, 'not Q' is 'It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink'.\n\nApplying the contrapositive inference rule, we can conclude that 'not P', which is 'The sneg was not crampled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
