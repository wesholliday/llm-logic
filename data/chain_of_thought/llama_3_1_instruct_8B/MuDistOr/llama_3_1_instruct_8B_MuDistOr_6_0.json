The original statement 'The password must have contained a number or a special character' implies that the password must have contained either a number or a special character, or both. It does not necessarily mean that the password must have contained a number or it must have contained a special character, as these are two separate conditions. The original statement is inclusive, meaning it allows for the possibility of both conditions being true at the same time.\n\nAnswer: no",
