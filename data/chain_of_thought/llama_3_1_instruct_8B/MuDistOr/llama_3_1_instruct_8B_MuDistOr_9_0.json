This is often denoted by the word 'or'. In this case, the statement implies that the package was delivered by either a truck or a plane, but it does not exclude the possibility that it was delivered by both. However, the statement does not imply that the package was delivered by only one of the two options. \n\nThe statement 'The package must have been delivered by truck or it must have been delivered by plane' is a conjunction, which means it presents two separate options as two distinct possibilities. This statement implies that the package was delivered by either a truck or a plane, but it does not exclude the possibility that it was delivered by both. However, the statement does not imply that the package was delivered by only one of the two options.\n\nThe key difference between the two statements is the use of 'or' in the original statement and the use of 'or' in the second statement. The original statement is a disjunction, while the second statement is a conjunction. However, both statements are logically equivalent because the word 'or' in the second statement is used to present two separate options, not to exclude the possibility of both options being true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
