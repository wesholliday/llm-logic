This is an example of a disjunctive statement, where the 'or' indicates that one or the other condition must be met, but not both. The statement does not imply that the contract must have been approved by both the legal team and the CEO. Therefore, we can infer that the contract must have been approved by the legal team or it must have been approved by the CEO, as the original statement already includes these two options.\n\nAnswer: yes",
