            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The payment must have been made by credit card or bank transfer' is a compound sentence with two options for payment methods. It implies that the payment could have been made in one of two ways: either by credit card or by bank transfer. The word 'or' is used to indicate an alternative, which means that both options are mutually exclusive. \n\nIn this context, the statement is saying that the payment was made in one of these two specific ways, but not necessarily both. Therefore, we can infer that the payment must have been made by either credit card or bank transfer, but not necessarily both.\n\nAnswer: yes",
