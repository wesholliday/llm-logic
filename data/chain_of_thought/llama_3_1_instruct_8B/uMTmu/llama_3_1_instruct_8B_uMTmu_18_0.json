            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that the doll was not plastic, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement, \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal,\" is a conditional statement. It implies that if the doll is plastic, then the truck has to be metal, but it does not say anything about the material of the doll if the truck is not metal. The second statement, \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal,\" is a negation of the first statement, which means the truck does not have to be metal. However, this does not provide any information about the material of the doll.\n\nFrom the given statements, we cannot directly infer the material of the doll. The first statement only provides a condition for the doll being plastic, and the second statement does not provide any information about the doll. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the doll was not plastic based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
