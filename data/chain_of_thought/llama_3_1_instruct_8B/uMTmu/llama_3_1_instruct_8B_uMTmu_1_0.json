            "content": "Explanation: The given statements seem to be contradictory. The first statement, \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding,\" suggests a conditional relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence at the wedding. This implies that Sue's presence is dependent on Mary's presence. However, the second statement, \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding,\" suggests that Sue's presence is not necessarily dependent on Mary's presence. \n\nTo determine if we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding, we need to analyze the implications of these statements. If Sue's presence is not dependent on Mary's presence, it doesn't necessarily mean that Mary was not at the wedding. It only means that Sue's presence is not guaranteed if Mary is present. However, the first statement implies that if Mary was at the wedding, Sue must have been there. This creates a contradiction with the second statement, which suggests that Sue's presence is not guaranteed.\n\nHowever, the second statement can be rephrased as \"Sue's presence is not necessary for the wedding.\" This means that Sue's presence is not a requirement for the wedding to take place. It does not necessarily mean that Sue was not at the wedding. It's possible that Sue was at the wedding, but her presence was not necessary for the wedding to occur.\n\nGiven the information, we cannot conclude that Mary was not at the wedding. The statements do not provide enough information to make this inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
