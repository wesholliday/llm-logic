            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The mummy was awake' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is a conditional statement. It implies that if the condition (the vampire was awake) is true, then the consequence (the mummy was awake) must also be true. However, this does not imply that the condition is true. \n\nThe second statement 'The vampire was awake' is a simple statement that asserts the truth of the condition in the conditional statement. \n\nTo infer 'The mummy was awake', we need to know that the condition in the conditional statement is true. Since we have a statement that asserts the truth of the condition, we can use this information to make the inference.\n\nIn logic, this is an example of modus ponens, a valid argument form. It follows the pattern: \n\n1. If P, then Q (conditional statement)\n2. P (assertion of the condition)\n3. Therefore, Q (consequence)\n\nIn this case, P is 'The vampire was awake', Q is 'The mummy was awake', and the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
