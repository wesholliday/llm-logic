            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Jen watched basketball' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' is a conditional statement. It implies that if the condition (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequence (Jen watched basketball) must also be true. The second statement 'Tom watched football' is a simple statement that provides the condition for the conditional statement. \n\nTo infer 'Jen watched basketball', we need to check if the condition (Tom watched football) is true. Since the second statement confirms that Tom watched football, we can use the conditional statement to conclude that Jen watched basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
