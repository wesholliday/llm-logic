The first statement 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' is a conditional statement. It implies that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. The second statement 'The cake was chocolate' is a simple statement that asserts the cake is indeed chocolate.\n\nTo infer 'The muffins were blueberry', we need to see if the conditions of the first statement are met. Since the second statement confirms that the cake is indeed chocolate, we can use this information to conclude that the muffins must be blueberry according to the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
