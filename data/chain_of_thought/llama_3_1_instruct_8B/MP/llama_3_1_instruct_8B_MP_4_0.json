It implies that if the condition (the alien visited Mars) is true, then the consequence (the robot visited Jupiter) must also be true. \n\nThe second statement 'The alien visited Mars' is a factual statement that provides the condition for the conditional statement. \n\nTo infer 'The robot visited Jupiter', we need to check if the condition in the conditional statement is met. Since 'The alien visited Mars' is true, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that the consequence 'The robot visited Jupiter' must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer 'The robot visited Jupiter' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
