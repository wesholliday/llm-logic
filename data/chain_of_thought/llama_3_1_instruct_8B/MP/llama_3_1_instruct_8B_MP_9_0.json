            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Mark bought the blue shirt', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the consequence (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true. The second statement 'Lisa bought the red shirt' is a fact that we know to be true. \n\nSince we know that the condition in the first statement is true (Lisa bought the red shirt), we can use the rule of inference for conditional statements, which states that if the condition is true, then the consequence must also be true. Therefore, we can infer that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
