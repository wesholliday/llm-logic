            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The truck was blue' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'The car was red' and Q is 'The truck was blue'. This statement does not provide any information about the color of the truck unless the car is red.\n\nThe second statement 'The car was red' is a simple statement that provides information about the color of the car.\n\nTo infer 'The truck was blue', we need to combine the two statements. Since the first statement is a conditional statement and the second statement is a premise that satisfies the condition (the car is indeed red), we can use the modus ponens rule of inference, which states that if we have a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' and we know P is true, then we can infer Q.\n\nIn this case, P is 'The car was red' and Q is 'The truck was blue'. Since we know the car is red, we can infer that the truck is blue.\n\nAnswer: yes",
