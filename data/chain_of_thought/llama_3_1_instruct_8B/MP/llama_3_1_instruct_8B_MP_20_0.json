            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The banana was yellow' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' is a conditional statement. It implies that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the consequence (the banana being yellow) must also be true. The second statement 'The apple was red' is a simple statement that provides the condition for the conditional statement. \n\nTo infer 'The banana was yellow', we need to check if the condition in the conditional statement is met. Since 'The apple was red' is true, the condition is indeed met. According to the conditional statement, if the condition is true, then the consequence must also be true. Therefore, we can logically conclude that 'The banana was yellow'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
