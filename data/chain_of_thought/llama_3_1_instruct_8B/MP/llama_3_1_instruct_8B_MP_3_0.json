            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The book is a mystery novel' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first statement is 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel'. This is a conditional statement, where the condition is 'the book was written by James' and the consequence is 'the book is a mystery novel'. The second statement is 'The book was written by James'. \n\nTo infer 'The book is a mystery novel', we need to find a logical connection between the given statements. The second statement directly matches the condition in the first statement. Since the condition is met, we can apply the consequence of the first statement to the second statement. Therefore, we can logically infer that 'The book is a mystery novel' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
