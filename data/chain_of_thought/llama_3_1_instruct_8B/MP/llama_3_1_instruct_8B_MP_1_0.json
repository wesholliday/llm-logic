            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument in the form of a syllogism. A syllogism is a form of deductive reasoning that uses two premises to arrive at a conclusion. In this case, we have two premises:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n2. Mary was at the wedding.\n\nWe can use the first premise to create a conditional statement, which can be read as \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding\". The second premise is P, which is \"Mary was at the wedding\". \n\nUsing the first premise, we can substitute P with \"Mary was at the wedding\" to get \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\". Then, we can substitute P with \"Mary was at the wedding\" in the first premise to get \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and then substitute \"Mary was at the wedding\" for P to get \"Sue was at the wedding\". \n\nThis is a valid argument because it follows the form of a syllogism, and the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Therefore, we can infer that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
