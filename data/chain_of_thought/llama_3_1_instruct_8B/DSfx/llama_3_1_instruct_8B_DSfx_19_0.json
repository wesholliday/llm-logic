The first statement is 'Either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled'. This is a disjunction, meaning it is one of the two options that is true. The second statement is 'The smonk is not plagged'. \n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the smonk is not plagged. Since the smonk is either plagged or vreebled, and it is not plagged, the only remaining option is that it must be vreebled. This is because the disjunction 'Either A or B' is true if either A or B (or both) is true. Since we know A (plagged) is not true, B (vreebled) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
