Either the smip is lupped or it is shripped.\n2. The smip is not lupped.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the smip is either lupped or shripped. The 'or' operator in this context is inclusive, meaning that the smip can be both lupped and shripped at the same time.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the smip is not lupped. \n\nNow, let's combine these two pieces of information. Since the smip is not lupped, and it must be either lupped or shripped, it follows logically that the smip must be shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
