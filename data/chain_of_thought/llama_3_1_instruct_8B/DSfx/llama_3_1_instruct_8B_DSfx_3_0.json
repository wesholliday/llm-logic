            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The splat is morphed', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is a disjunction, which means it is either true or false. It states that either the splat is quanked or it is morphed. The second statement explicitly states that the splat is not quanked. \n\nUsing the process of elimination, we can deduce that if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed, as the first statement covers all possible scenarios. This is because the first statement is a disjunction, and the second statement eliminates one of the possibilities (quanked). Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
