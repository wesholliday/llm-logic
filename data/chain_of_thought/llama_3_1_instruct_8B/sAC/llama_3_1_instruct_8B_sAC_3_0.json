            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the conclusion 'The book was written by James' follows from the given premises, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. The first premise is a conditional statement: 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.' This means that if the antecedent (the book was written by James) is true, then the consequent (the book is a mystery novel) must also be true. The second premise states that 'The book is a mystery novel' is true. \n\nNow, we need to see if we can logically conclude that 'The book was written by James' is true. To do this, we can use a process called modus ponens, which is a form of deductive reasoning. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement 'If A, then B' and we know that A is true, then we can conclude that B is true. In this case, we have the conditional statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' and we know that 'The book is a mystery novel' is true. Therefore, using modus ponens, we can conclude that 'The book was written by James' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
