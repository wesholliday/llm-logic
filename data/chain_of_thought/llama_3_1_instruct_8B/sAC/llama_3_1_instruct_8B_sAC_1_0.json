            "content": "Explanation: To determine if it follows that 'Mary was at the wedding' is true, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement, 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true. However, the second statement, 'Sue was at the wedding', is a separate fact that does not necessarily depend on the first statement.\n\nGiven that 'Sue was at the wedding' is true, we cannot conclude that 'Mary was at the wedding' is true. The truth of 'Sue was at the wedding' does not provide any information about the truth of 'Mary was at the wedding'. The first statement only tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding, but it does not tell us that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that 'Mary was at the wedding' is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
