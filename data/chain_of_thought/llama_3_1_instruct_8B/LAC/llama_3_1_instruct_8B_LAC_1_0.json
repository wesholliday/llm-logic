            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can logically infer 'Mary was at the wedding' from the given statements, we need to analyze the relationship between the statements. The first statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement. This means that if the condition (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true. The second statement 'Sue was at the wedding' is a simple statement stating a fact.\n\nTo infer 'Mary was at the wedding', we need to use the first statement as a bridge to connect the two statements. Since we know 'Sue was at the wedding' is true, we can use the first statement to conclude that 'Mary was at the wedding' must also be true, because the condition in the first statement is met.\n\nHowever, this is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. It is not a valid logical inference. The fact that Sue was at the wedding does not necessarily mean that Mary was at the wedding. There could be other reasons why Sue was at the wedding that do not involve Mary's presence.\n\nAnswer: no",
