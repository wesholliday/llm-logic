            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can logically infer 'The book was written by James' from the given statements, we need to analyze the relationship between the statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.' This means that if the condition (the book was written by James) is true, then the consequence (the book is a mystery novel) must also be true. The second statement is a simple statement: 'The book is a mystery novel.' \n\nTo infer 'The book was written by James', we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. Since the first statement is a conditional statement, we can use the modus ponens rule of inference, which states that if we have a conditional statement 'If A, then B' and we know that A is true, then we can conclude that B is true. However, in this case, we are given the consequence (B) and we want to infer the condition (A). This is not a direct application of modus ponens.\n\nHowever, we can use the contrapositive of the first statement, which is 'If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.' Since we know that the book is a mystery novel (from the second statement), we can conclude that the book was written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
