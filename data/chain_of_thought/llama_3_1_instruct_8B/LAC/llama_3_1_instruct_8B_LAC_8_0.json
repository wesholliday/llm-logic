            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can logically infer 'The vampire was awake' from the given statements, we need to analyze the relationship between the statements. The first statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is a conditional statement. It implies that if the condition (the vampire being awake) is true, then the consequence (the mummy being awake) is also true. \n\nThe second statement 'The mummy was awake' is a simple statement stating a fact. \n\nTo infer 'The vampire was awake', we need to find a logical connection between the two statements. Since the first statement is a conditional, we can use the modus ponens rule of inference, which states that if we have a conditional statement 'If A, then B' and we know A is true, then we can infer B is true. However, in this case, we are given the consequence (the mummy was awake) instead of the condition (the vampire was awake). \n\nTo apply modus ponens, we need to rearrange the conditional statement to 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake'. However, the original statement does not provide this information. Therefore, we cannot directly apply modus ponens to infer 'The vampire was awake' from the given statements.\n\nHowever, we can use the contrapositive of the original conditional statement, which is 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake'. Since we know the mummy was awake, we can infer the vampire was awake using the contrapositive. \n\nAnswer: yes",
