            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The milk is on the counter', let's break down the given statements. The first statement 'Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge' presents two possibilities: the milk is on the counter or it's in the fridge. The second statement 'It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge' implies that the milk is not necessarily in the fridge, as the word 'must' is negated. \n\nGiven that the milk is not necessarily in the fridge, we can conclude that the milk is on the counter, as the first statement presents the two possibilities and the second statement eliminates one of them. This is an example of a logical deduction using the principle of elimination.\n\nAnswer: yes",
