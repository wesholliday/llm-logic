            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The book is on the shelf', let's analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table' is a disjunction, which means it has two possible outcomes: the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table. The second statement 'It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table' implies that the book is not necessarily resting on the table, which means it could be on the shelf.\n\nHowever, the second statement does not directly confirm that the book is on the shelf. It only eliminates one possibility (the book resting on the table), leaving the other possibility (the book being on the shelf) as a potential outcome. Since we cannot rule out the possibility of the book being on the shelf, we can infer that it is indeed on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
