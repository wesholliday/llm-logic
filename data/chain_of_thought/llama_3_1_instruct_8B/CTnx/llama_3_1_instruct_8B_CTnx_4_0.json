            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the fribble was snurgled' and Q is 'the fribble did not crink'.\n\nTo infer the new statement, we need to reverse the condition and the consequence. In a conditional statement, if we reverse the condition and the consequence, we get a new statement that is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, this new statement is in the form of 'If not Q, then not P', which is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. Therefore, the contrapositive of 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink' is 'If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled'.\n\nSince the new statement is the contrapositive of the original statement, it is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we can infer 'If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
