The given statement implies that being 'blummed' and being 'zimmed' are mutually exclusive states, as it states that if a flug is 'blummed', it cannot be 'zimmed'. However, this does not necessarily mean that if a flug is 'zimmed', it cannot be 'blummed'. The given statement only provides information about the relationship between 'blummed' and 'zimmed' in one direction, not the other. Therefore, we cannot infer the relationship between 'zimmed' and 'blummed' in the opposite direction.\n\nAnswer: no",
