            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg did not sproted the frink'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the sneg was crampled' and Q is 'the sneg did not sproted the frink'.\n\nTo infer the new statement, we need to apply the rule of contrapositive, which states that 'If P, then Q' is logically equivalent to 'If not Q, then not P'. In this case, we can rewrite the given statement as 'If not (the sneg did not sproted the frink), then not (the sneg was crampled)', which simplifies to 'If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled'.\n\nHowever, the original statement does not explicitly state that the sneg sproted the frink when it was not crampled. It only states that if the sneg was crampled, then it did not sproted the frink. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that if the sneg sproted the frink, then it was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: no",
