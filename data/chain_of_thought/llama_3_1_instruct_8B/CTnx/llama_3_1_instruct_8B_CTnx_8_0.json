            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical inference using the concept of contrapositive. The original statement is in the form of 'If A, then B' (If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled). To infer the contrapositive, we need to reverse the order of the statements and negate both. The contrapositive of 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the original statement would be 'If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked'. This is because we have reversed the order of the statements and negated both. The original statement tells us that if the sprocket is cranked, it is not daggled, so if it is daggled, it must not be cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
