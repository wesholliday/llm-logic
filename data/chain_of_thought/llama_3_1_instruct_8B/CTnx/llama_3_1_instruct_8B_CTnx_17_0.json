            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the flob movated, then the flob was not skizzled', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob did not movated'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the flob was skizzled' and Q is 'the flob did not movated'. \n\nTo infer the new statement, we need to apply the principle of contrapositive, which states that 'If P, then Q' is equivalent to 'If not Q, then not P'. In this case, we can rewrite the given statement as 'If not Q, then not P', which becomes 'If the flob movated, then the flob was not skizzled'. \n\nHowever, we also need to consider the possibility of the flob not movating and not being skizzled, which is not explicitly mentioned in the given statement. But since the given statement only provides information about the relationship between being skizzled and movating, we can still infer the contrapositive statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
