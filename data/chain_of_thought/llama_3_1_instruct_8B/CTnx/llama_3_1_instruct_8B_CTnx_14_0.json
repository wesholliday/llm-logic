            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the clug snugged, then the clug was not fleeked', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug did not snugged'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the clug was fleeked' and Q is 'the clug did not snugged'.\n\nIn logic, this type of statement is known as a contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. To find the contrapositive of the given statement, we need to negate both P and Q.\n\nThe contrapositive of 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug did not snugged' is 'If the clug snugged, then the clug was not fleeked'. This is because we have negated both P ('the clug was fleeked' becomes 'the clug snugged') and Q ('the clug did not snugged' becomes 'the clug was fleeked').\n\nSince the given statement is in the form of a contrapositive, we can infer that 'If the clug snugged, then the clug was not fleeked' is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
