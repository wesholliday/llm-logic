            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the whiffle tink, then the whiffle was not shanked', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle did not tink'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the whiffle was shanked' and Q is 'the whiffle did not tink'.\n\nTo infer the new statement, we need to apply the rule of contrapositive, which states that 'If P, then Q' is equivalent to 'If not Q, then not P'. In this case, we can apply the contrapositive rule to the given statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of 'If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle did not tink' is 'If the whiffle tink, then the whiffle was not shanked'. This is because we have swapped the antecedent (P) and the consequent (Q) and negated both.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the new statement 'If the whiffle tink, then the whiffle was not shanked' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
