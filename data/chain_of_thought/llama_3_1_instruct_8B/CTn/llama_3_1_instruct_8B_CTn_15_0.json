            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane', we need to analyze the given statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin did not take a train'. This is a conditional statement, where the first part is the condition (Sam took a plane) and the second part is the consequence (Erin did not take a train). \n\nThe given statement does not provide any information about what happens when Erin takes a train. It only tells us what happens when Sam takes a plane. Therefore, we cannot directly infer the relationship between Erin taking a train and Sam taking a plane from the given statement.\n\nHowever, we can infer the contrapositive of the given statement, which is 'If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane'. This is because the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive is formed by swapping the condition and the consequence and negating both.\n\nAnswer: yes",
