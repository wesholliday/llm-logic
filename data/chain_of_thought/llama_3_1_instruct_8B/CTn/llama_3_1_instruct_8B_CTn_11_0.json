            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical inference using the concept of contrapositive. The original statement is in the form of \"If P, then Q\" (If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry). To form the contrapositive, we need to swap the P and Q and negate both. The contrapositive of the original statement would be \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\" However, the question asks for the inference \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\" This is not the contrapositive of the original statement, but rather the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of the original statement would be \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\" However, the inverse does not logically follow from the original statement. The contrapositive is a logically equivalent statement, but the inverse is not. \n\nAnswer: no",
