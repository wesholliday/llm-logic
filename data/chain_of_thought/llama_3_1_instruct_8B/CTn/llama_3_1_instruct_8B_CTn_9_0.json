            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt', we need to analyze the given statement and its logical implications. The original statement is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and Q is 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt'.\n\nTo infer the new statement, we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. In this case, the contrapositive would be 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt'. However, the original statement is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt', not 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'. The contrapositive of the original statement is 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nHowever, the original statement is not the contrapositive of the statement we are trying to infer. The original statement is the converse of the statement we are trying to infer. The converse of 'If P, then Q' is 'If Q, then P'. The converse of the statement we are trying to infer is 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt'. The original statement is not the converse of this statement.\n\nThe original statement is a conditional statement, and the statement we are trying to infer is the converse of the original statement's contrapositive. The converse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the statement 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
