            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as \"modus tollens\" or \"modus tollens inference.\" Modus tollens is a valid form of deductive reasoning that follows the pattern: \n\nIf A, then B\nNot B\n\u2234 Not A\n\nHowever, the given statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow\" is not a direct application of modus tollens. It is more accurately described as a conditional statement where the antecedent (the condition) is \"the apple was red\" and the consequent (the outcome) is \"the banana was not yellow.\" \n\nTo infer \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red\" from the given statement, we would need to apply a different logical rule, which is known as \"modus tollens\" or \"modus tollens inference.\" However, the original statement does not directly support this inference because it does not provide a direct relationship between the color of the banana and the color of the apple.\n\nHowever, we can apply a different logical rule, known as \"converse of a conditional statement\" or \"converse inference,\" which states that if \"If A, then B\" is true, then \"If not B, then not A\" is also true. \n\nUsing this rule, we can infer that if \"If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow\" is true, then \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
