            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was not awake'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If A, then B'. \n\nIn this case, A is 'the vampire was awake' and B is 'the mummy was not awake'. The given statement implies that whenever the vampire is awake, the mummy is not awake. However, it does not provide any information about the converse situation, i.e., when the mummy is awake.\n\nTo infer 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake', we would need a statement that directly or indirectly implies that whenever the mummy is awake, the vampire is not awake. The given statement does not provide this information.\n\nHowever, we can use a logical rule called 'contrapositive' to infer the converse. The contrapositive of 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. In this case, the contrapositive of 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was not awake' is 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake'. This is because the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake' using the contrapositive rule.\n\nAnswer: yes",
