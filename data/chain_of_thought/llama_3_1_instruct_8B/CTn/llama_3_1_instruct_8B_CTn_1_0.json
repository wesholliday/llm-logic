            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" The original statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\" is a conditional statement, where the first part is the condition (Mary being at the wedding) and the second part is the consequence (Sue not being at the wedding). \n\nThe statement we are trying to infer, \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding,\" is also a conditional statement, but it reverses the condition and consequence. However, this reversal does not logically follow from the original statement. The original statement does not provide any information about what happens when Sue is at the wedding; it only tells us what happens when Mary is at the wedding.\n\nTo illustrate this, consider a simple example: \"If it rains, then I will not go to the park.\" This statement does not imply that \"If I go to the park, then it will not rain.\" The two statements are not logically equivalent, and we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\" from the original statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
