            "content": "Explanation: This is an example of a logical argument involving a conditional statement and its contrapositive. The original statement is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was not metal.' This can be rewritten as 'P \u2192 \u00acM', where P represents 'the doll was plastic' and M represents 'the truck was metal'.\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement 'P \u2192 Q' is '\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP'. In this case, the contrapositive of the original statement would be 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic'.\n\nHowever, the statement we are trying to infer is 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic'. This is the inverse of the original statement, not the contrapositive. The inverse of 'P \u2192 \u00acM' is 'M \u2192 \u00acP'.\n\nThe inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The inverse of a statement does not follow logically from the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
