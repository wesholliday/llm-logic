            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park', we need to analyze the given statement 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo'. This is a conditional statement, where the first part is the condition (Joe went to the park) and the second part is the consequence (Lucy did not go to the zoo). \n\nThe given statement does not provide any information about what Lucy did when Joe did not go to the park. It only tells us what happens when Joe goes to the park. Therefore, we cannot directly infer the relationship between Lucy going to the zoo and Joe not going to the park.\n\nHowever, we can infer the contrapositive of the given statement, which is 'If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park'. This is because the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the condition and the consequence, and then swapping them.\n\nAnswer: yes",
