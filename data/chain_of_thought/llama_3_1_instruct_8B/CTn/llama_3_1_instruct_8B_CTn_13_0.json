            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical inference using the concept of contrapositive. The original statement is in the form of 'If A, then not B', where A is 'the car was red' and B is 'the truck was blue'. To infer the contrapositive, we need to swap the positions of A and B and negate both. The contrapositive of 'If A, then not B' is 'If not B, then not A'. \n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the original statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was not blue' would be 'If the truck was blue, then the car was not red'. This is because we have swapped the positions of 'the car was red' and 'the truck was blue', and negated both. \n\nTherefore, we can logically infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
