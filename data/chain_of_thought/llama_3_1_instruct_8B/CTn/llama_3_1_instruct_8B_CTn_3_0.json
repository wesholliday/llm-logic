            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James', we need to analyze the given statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the book was written by James' and Q is 'the book is not a mystery novel'.\n\nTo infer the new statement 'If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James', we need to apply the rule of contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. \n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of 'If the book was written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel' would be 'If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James'. This is because we have swapped the positions of P and Q, and negated both.\n\nSince the given statement and the new statement are contrapositives of each other, we can infer the new statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
