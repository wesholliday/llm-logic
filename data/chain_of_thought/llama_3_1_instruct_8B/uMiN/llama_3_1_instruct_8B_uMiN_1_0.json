            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding, we need to analyze the statement \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\" The word \"might\" indicates a possibility, suggesting that there is a chance Mary was not at the wedding. However, it does not rule out the possibility that Mary was indeed at the wedding. The statement does not provide any information about the likelihood or certainty of Mary's presence at the wedding. It only acknowledges that there is a possibility she might not have been there. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that Mary must not have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
