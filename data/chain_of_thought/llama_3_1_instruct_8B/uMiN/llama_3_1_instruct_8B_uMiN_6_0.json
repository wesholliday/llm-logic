            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza, we need to consider the given statement. The statement \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" implies that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza. This does not necessarily mean that Sue did not choose pizza, but rather that it is a possible scenario. However, it does suggest that the choice of pizza is not a certainty for Sue. \n\nThe key concept here is the word \"might,\" which indicates a possibility rather than a certainty. This means that we cannot rule out the possibility that Sue chose pizza, but we can say that it's not a requirement or a must. Therefore, we can infer that it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
