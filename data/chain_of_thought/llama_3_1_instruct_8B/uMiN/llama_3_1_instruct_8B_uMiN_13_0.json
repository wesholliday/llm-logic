            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that it's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box, we need to analyze the statement. The statement \"The toy might not be in the toy box\" implies that there is a possibility that the toy is not in the toy box. This is a statement of possibility, not a statement of necessity. It does not rule out the possibility that the toy could be in the toy box, but it does suggest that it is not a certainty. Therefore, we can infer that it's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box because the statement does not imply a universal or absolute condition.\n\nAnswer: yes",
