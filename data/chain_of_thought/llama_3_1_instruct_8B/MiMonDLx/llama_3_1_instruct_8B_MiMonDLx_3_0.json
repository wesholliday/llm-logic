This statement implies that the zooble's location is uncertain and it could be inside the plimp. However, it does not provide any information about the zooble's location in relation to the quorple. The statement does not mention the quorple at all, so we cannot make any conclusions about the zooble's relationship with the quorple based on this information.\n\nAnswer: no",
