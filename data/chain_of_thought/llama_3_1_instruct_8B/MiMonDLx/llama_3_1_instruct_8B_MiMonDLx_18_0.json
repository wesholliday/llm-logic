This statement is in the form of a conditional sentence, where 'might be' is a modal verb indicating possibility. The word 'or' is not present in the given statement, but we can infer that the statement is setting up a condition for something to be true. The word 'or' is often used to provide alternative possibilities in a conditional sentence. Therefore, we can logically infer that the statement is setting up an alternative possibility for 'blurble', which is 'plimp'. \n\nAnswer: yes",
