            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The zibber might be froodle or on wibble', we need to analyze the given statement 'The zibber might be froodle'. The word 'might' is a modal verb that indicates possibility or uncertainty. It suggests that the statement is not a definitive fact but rather a potential or hypothetical situation. \n\nIn this context, the statement 'The zibber might be froodle' implies that there is a possibility that the zibber could be froodle, but it does not exclude other possibilities. It does not provide any information about the zibber being on wibble. \n\nHowever, since the statement does not rule out the possibility of the zibber being on wibble, we can infer that it might be on wibble as well, given the uncertainty and possibility implied by the word 'might'. This is because the statement does not provide any information that would rule out the possibility of the zibber being on wibble.\n\nAnswer: yes",
