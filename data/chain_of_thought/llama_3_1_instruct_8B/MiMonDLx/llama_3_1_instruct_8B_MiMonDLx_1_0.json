The key phrase here is 'might be', which indicates a possibility or uncertainty. This suggests that the statement is not definitive and leaves room for other possibilities. \n\nIn this context, 'frozz' is presented as one of the possibilities, but it does not exclude other options. The statement does not provide any information that would rule out 'plonk' as a possibility. Therefore, based on the given information, we can infer that 'The blurble might be wibble a frozz or plonk' is a plausible conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
