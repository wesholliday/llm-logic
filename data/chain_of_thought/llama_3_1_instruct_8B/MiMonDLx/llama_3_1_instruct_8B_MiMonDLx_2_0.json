The word 'might' indicates a possibility or uncertainty, suggesting that the blimple's location is not definite. However, the given statement does not provide any information about the blimple being in the wobble. It only mentions the possibility of the blimple being on the flump. \n\nTo infer the additional information, we would need more context or a more specific statement that connects the blimple to both the flump and the wobble. Since the given statement only mentions the flump, we cannot logically conclude that the blimple might be in the wobble.\n\nAnswer: no",
