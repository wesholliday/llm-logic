The word 'might' suggests uncertainty and leaves room for other possibilities, including the flight being on schedule. This is an example of a non-exclusive or statement, where the truth of one option does not preclude the truth of the other option. Therefore, we can infer that the flight might be delayed or on time.\n\nAnswer: yes",
