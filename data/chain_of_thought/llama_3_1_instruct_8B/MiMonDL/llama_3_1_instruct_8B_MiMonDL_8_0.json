It does not provide any information about the flowers being yellow, but it also does not rule out the possibility of them being yellow. Therefore, we can infer that the flowers might be red or yellow, as well as any other color, because the original statement does not provide any information that would exclude these possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes",
