            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The train might be late' implies that there is a possibility of the train being late, but it does not rule out the possibility of the train being on time. The word 'might' is a modal verb that expresses possibility, and it does not exclude the other possibility of the train arriving on schedule. Therefore, when we consider the statement 'The train might be late', we can also consider the possibility of the train being on time, as it is not mutually exclusive.\n\nAnswer: yes",
