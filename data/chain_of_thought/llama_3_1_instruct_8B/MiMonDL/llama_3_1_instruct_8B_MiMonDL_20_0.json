            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The team might win the game' implies that there is a possibility of the team winning the game, but it does not exclude the possibility of the team losing. The word 'might' is a modal verb that expresses possibility, and it does not rule out other outcomes. Therefore, when we consider the statement 'The team might win the game', we can infer that there are multiple possible outcomes, including winning and losing. This is because the statement does not provide any information that would rule out the possibility of the team losing.\n\nAnswer: yes",
