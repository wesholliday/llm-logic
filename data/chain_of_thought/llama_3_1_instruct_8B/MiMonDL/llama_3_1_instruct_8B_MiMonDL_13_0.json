            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The meeting might be cancelled' implies that there is a possibility of the meeting being cancelled. However, it does not exclude the possibility of the meeting being rescheduled. In fact, if the meeting is rescheduled, it is still a possibility, albeit a different one. The original statement does not rule out the possibility of a change in the meeting's schedule, it only rules out the possibility of the meeting happening as originally planned. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that 'The meeting might be cancelled or rescheduled' is a possible interpretation of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
