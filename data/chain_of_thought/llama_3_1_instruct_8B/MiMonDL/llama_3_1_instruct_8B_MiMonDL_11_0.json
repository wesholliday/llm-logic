In fact, it leaves open the possibility of other weather conditions as well. The word 'might' is a modal verb that indicates uncertainty or possibility, and it does not exclude other outcomes. Therefore, we can infer that the weather might be sunny or rainy, or it might be any other type of weather condition.\n\nAnswer: yes",
