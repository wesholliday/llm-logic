This statement does not provide any information about the car's current condition when it does not need repairs. It only addresses the possibility of needing repairs. Therefore, we cannot infer that the car might be in good condition based on the original statement, as it only addresses the possibility of needing repairs, not the possibility of not needing repairs.\n\nAnswer: no",
