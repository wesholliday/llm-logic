            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The computer might be broken or working' from 'The computer might be broken', we need to analyze the meaning of the original statement. 'The computer might be broken' is a statement that expresses uncertainty about the state of the computer, indicating that it could be either broken or not broken. This is a classic example of a modal expression, where 'might' is used to convey possibility.\n\nWhen we consider the original statement, we are already considering the possibility of the computer being broken. The phrase 'might be broken' inherently includes the possibility of the computer not being broken, as it is a contradictory state. Therefore, when we say 'The computer might be broken', we are, in effect, also considering the possibility of the computer being working, as it is the opposite of being broken.\n\nThis is a classic example of a logical inference, where the original statement implies the possibility of the opposite state. Therefore, we can logically infer that 'The computer might be broken or working' from 'The computer might be broken'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
