            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of a modus tollens, which is a valid deductive reasoning pattern. Modus tollens states that if the antecedent (the first premise) of a conditional statement is false, then the consequent (the second premise) must also be false. In this case, the antecedent \"If the cake was chocolate\" is false because we know that the cake was not chocolate. Therefore, according to modus tollens, the consequent \"The muffins were not blueberry\" must also be false.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
