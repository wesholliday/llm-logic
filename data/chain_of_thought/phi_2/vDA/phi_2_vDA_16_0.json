            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of a modus tollens, which is a valid deductive reasoning pattern. Modus tollens states that if the antecedent (the first premise) is false, then the consequent (the second premise) must also be false. In this case, the antecedent is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,\" and the consequent is \"The pants were not denim.\" Since we know that the shirt was not made of cotton (the first premise), it logically follows that the pants could have been made of anything other than denim. Therefore, the conclusion that the pants were not denim is valid.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
