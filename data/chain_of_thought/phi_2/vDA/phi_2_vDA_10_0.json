            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of modus tollens, a valid deductive reasoning pattern. Modus tollens states that if the antecedent (if-then statement) is false, then the consequent (the result or conclusion) must also be false. In this case, the first premise establishes a conditional relationship between the dog being inside and the cat being outside. The second premise provides information about the dog not being inside. Therefore, it logically follows that the cat was not outside. Answer: Yes\n",
