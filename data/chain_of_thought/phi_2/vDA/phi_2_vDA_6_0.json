            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of modus tollens, which is a valid logical form. Modus tollens states that if the conditional statement \"If A then B\" is true, and we know that B is false, then we can conclude that A must also be false. In this case, the first premise establishes the conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" The second premise tells us that Sue did not choose pizza (B is false). Therefore, we can logically conclude that Bob did not choose pasta (A is false) using modus tollens.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
