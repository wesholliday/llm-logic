            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of a modus tollens, which is a valid deductive reasoning pattern. It follows the structure \"If A then B, Not B, Therefore Not A.\" In this case, A represents the griffin being in the forest and B represents the unicorn being in the forest. The first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest (A), then the unicorn would also be there (B). The second premise asserts that the griffin is not in the forest (Not A). Therefore, it logically follows that the unicorn must not be in the forest (Not B) as well.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
