            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of a modus tollens, which is a valid deductive reasoning pattern. Modus tollens states that if the antecedent (the first premise) is false, then the consequent (the conclusion) must also be false. In this case, the antecedent is \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal,\" and the consequent is \"The truck was not metal.\" Since we know that the doll was not plastic (the second premise), it logically follows that the truck could have been made of any material other than metal. Therefore, the conclusion that the truck was not metal is valid.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
