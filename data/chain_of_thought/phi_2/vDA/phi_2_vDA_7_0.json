Modus tollens states that if we have two premises in the form \"If A then B\" and \"Not B\", then we can conclude \"Not A\". In this case, the first premise is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race,\" and the second premise is \"Alex did not finish the race.\" Therefore, we can logically conclude that \"Chris did not finish the race.\"\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
