            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of a conditional statement, where the first premise states that if one thing happens (Lisa buying the red shirt), then another thing will happen (Mark buying the blue shirt). The second premise tells us that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Therefore, we can logically conclude that Mark did not buy the blue shirt because the condition for him to do so was not met.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
