            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of modus tollens, which is a valid logical form. Modus tollens states that if the antecedent (the first premise) of a conditional statement is false, then the consequent (the second premise) must also be false. In this case, the antecedent \"If the vampire was awake\" is false because it is stated that the vampire was not awake. Therefore, we can conclude that the mummy was not awake based on the given premises and the logical form of modus tollens.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
