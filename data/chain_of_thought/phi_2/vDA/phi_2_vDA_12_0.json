            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of modus tollens, which is a valid logical form. Modus tollens states that if P implies Q, and not-Q is true, then not-P must also be true. In this case, the first premise establishes a conditional relationship between Joe going to the park (P) and Lucy going to the zoo (Q). The second premise asserts that Joe did not go to the park (not-P), which means Q cannot be true. Therefore, by modus tollens, we can conclude that Lucy did not go to the zoo (not-Q).\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
