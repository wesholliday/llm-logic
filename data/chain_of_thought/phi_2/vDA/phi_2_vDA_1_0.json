            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of a modus tollens, which is a valid deductive reasoning pattern. Modus tollens states that if we have two premises in the form \"If A then B\" and \"Not B\", then we can conclude \"Not A\". In this case, the first premise is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" which means that if Mary attended the wedding, Sue must also attend. The second premise states that \"Mary was not at the wedding,\" meaning that she did not attend. Therefore, we can conclude that \"Sue was not at the wedding\" using modus tollens.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
