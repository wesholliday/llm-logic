            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of modus tollens, which is a valid logical form. Modus tollens states that if the conditional statement \"If A then B\" is true, and we know that B is false, then we can conclude that A must also be false. In this case, the first premise establishes the conditional statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" The second premise tells us that Sam did not take a plane (B is false). Therefore, we can logically conclude that Erin did not take a train (A is false) using modus tollens.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
