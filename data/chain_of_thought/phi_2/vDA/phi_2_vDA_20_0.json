            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of a hypothetical syllogism, which has the following structure: If P, then Q. Not P. Therefore, not Q. In this case, P represents the apple being red and Q represents the banana being yellow. The first premise states that if the apple was red (P), then the banana would be yellow (Q). The second premise says that the apple is not red (not P). From these two premises, we can logically conclude that the banana is not yellow (not Q). Therefore, this argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
