Modus tollens states that if the antecedent (the first premise) of a conditional statement is false, then the consequent (the second premise) must also be false. In this case, the antecedent is 'If the book was written by James', and the consequent is 'The book is a mystery novel'. Since we know that the book was not written by James (the second premise), it follows logically that the book cannot be a mystery novel (the conclusion).\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
