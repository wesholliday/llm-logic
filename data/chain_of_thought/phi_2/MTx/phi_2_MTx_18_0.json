However, the second statement contradicts this by stating that the shank was not nugged. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about whether or not the shank was plooked based on these two statements alone.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the shank was not plooked. The first statement does not provide enough information to determine if the shank was plooked or not.\n",
