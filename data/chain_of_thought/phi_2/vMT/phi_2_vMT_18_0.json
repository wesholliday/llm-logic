            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of a modus tollens, which is a valid deductive reasoning pattern. Modus tollens states that if the antecedent (if A then B) is false, then the consequent (B) must also be false. In this case, the first premise establishes a conditional relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal. The second premise denies the truth of the consequent (the truck was not metal). Therefore, we can logically conclude that the antecedent (the doll was not plastic) must also be false.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
