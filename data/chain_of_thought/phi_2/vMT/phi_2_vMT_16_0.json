Modus tollens states that if the antecedent (the first premise) is false, then the consequent (the conclusion) must also be false. In this case, the antecedent is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,\" and the consequent is \"The pants were not denim.\" Since we know that the pants are not denim, it logically follows that the shirt cannot have been made of cotton.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
