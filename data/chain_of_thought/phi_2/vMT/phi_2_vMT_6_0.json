Modus tollens states that if the consequent (the second premise) of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent (the first premise) must also be false. In this case, the consequent \"Bob did not choose pasta\" is true, so we can conclude that the antecedent \"Sue did not choose pizza\" must also be true.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
