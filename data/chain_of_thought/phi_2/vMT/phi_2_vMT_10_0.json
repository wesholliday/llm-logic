            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of modus tollens, which is a valid logical form. Modus tollens states that if the antecedent (the first premise) is false, then the consequent (the conclusion) must also be false. In this case, the antecedent is 'If the dog was inside', and the consequent is 'The cat was outside'. The second premise tells us that the consequent is false, so we can conclude that the antecedent must also be false. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
