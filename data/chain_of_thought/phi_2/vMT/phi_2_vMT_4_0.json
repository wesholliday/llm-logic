Modus tollens states that if the antecedent (the first premise) of a conditional statement is false, then the consequent (the second premise) must also be false. In this case, the antecedent is \"If the alien visited Mars,\" and the consequent is \"The robot visited Jupiter.\" Since we know that the robot did not visit Jupiter (the second premise), it follows logically that the alien did not visit Mars (the conclusion).\nAnswer: Yes\n",
