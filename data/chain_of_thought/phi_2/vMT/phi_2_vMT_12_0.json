            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of modus tollens, which is a valid logical form. Modus tollens states that if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must also be false. In this case, P represents Joe going to the park, and Q represents Lucy going to the zoo. The first premise establishes that if Joe went to the park (P), then Lucy would have gone to the zoo (Q). However, the second premise states that Lucy did not go to the zoo (\u00acQ). Therefore, we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park (\u00acP) using modus tollens.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
