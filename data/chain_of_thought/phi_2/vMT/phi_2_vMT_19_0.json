            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of modus tollens, which is a valid logical form. Modus tollens states that if the consequent (the second premise) of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent (the first premise) must also be false. In this case, the second premise states that Jen did not watch basketball, which means that the consequent \"Jen watched basketball\" is false. Therefore, according to modus tollens, we can conclude that the antecedent \"Tom watched football\" must also be false.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
