            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of a hypothetical syllogism, which has the following structure: If P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P. In this case, P represents the statement \"the apple was red\" and Q represents the statement \"the banana was yellow\". The first premise states that if P is true, then Q must also be true. The second premise denies the truth of Q, which means that it cannot be inferred from the first premise. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises: not P, or in other words, the apple was not red.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
