Modus tollens states that if the consequent (the second premise) of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent (the first premise) must also be false. In this case, the consequent \"Kate did not eat salad\" is true, so we can conclude that the antecedent \"Ben did not eat pasta\" must also be true.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
