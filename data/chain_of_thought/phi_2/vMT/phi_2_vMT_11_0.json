            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of a modus tollens, which is a valid deductive reasoning pattern. Modus tollens states that if the antecedent (the first premise) of a conditional statement is false, then the consequent (the second premise) must also be false. In this case, the antecedent is \"If the cake was chocolate\" and the consequent is \"The muffins were blueberry\". The argument concludes that \"The cake was not chocolate\", which follows logically from the premises given.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
