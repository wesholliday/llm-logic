            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of modus tollens, which is a valid logical form. Modus tollens states that if the antecedent (the first premise) is false, then the consequent (the conclusion) must also be false. In this case, the antecedent is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake,\" and the consequent is \"The mummy was not awake.\" Since we know that the consequent is true (\"The mummy was not awake\"), we can conclude that the antecedent must also be true (\"The vampire was not awake\"). Therefore, this argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
