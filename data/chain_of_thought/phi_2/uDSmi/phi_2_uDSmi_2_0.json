            "content": " Explanation: The first premise states that either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table. This means that there are two possible scenarios for where the book could be - either it's on the shelf or it's resting on the table. The second premise adds a third possibility, which is that the book might not be resting on the table. However, this does not contradict the first premise because it still leaves room for the book to be on the shelf. Therefore, we cannot infer that the book is definitely on the shelf based on these two premises alone.\nAnswer: No\n",
