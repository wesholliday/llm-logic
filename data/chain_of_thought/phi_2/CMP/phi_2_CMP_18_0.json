    "user_prompt": "Suppose that pizza, burgers, and tacos are the most frequently ordered takeout foods. According to restaurant data, pizza likely will be the top takeout item ordered, followed by burgers, with tacos ordered much less frequently. These foods lead takeout orders, so if burgers aren\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn\u2019t, tacos will be. Moreover, pizza likely will lead takeout orders and hence burgers likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if pizza isn\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be?",

            "content": " Explanation: The given information states that pizza is the most frequently ordered takeout food, followed by burgers, with tacos being ordered much less frequently. This means that pizza leads takeout orders and hence burgers won't be the top takeout item ordered if pizza isn't. Additionally, since pizza likely will lead takeout orders, it's likely that burgers also won't be the top takeout item ordered. Therefore, if pizza isn't the top takeout item ordered, tacos are more likely to be the top takeout item ordered.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
