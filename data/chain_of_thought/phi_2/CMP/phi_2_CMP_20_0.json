    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing '### Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no'.",

This conclusion follows from the given information and logical reasoning. If tea retains more morning drinkers than coffee, and coffee retains more morning drinkers than soda, then it logically follows that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then soda must retain the most morning drinkers.\n",
