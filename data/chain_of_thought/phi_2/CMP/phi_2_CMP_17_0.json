    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the flu, common cold, and strep throat are the most prevalent illnesses this season. Doctors expect the flu likely will infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind. These are the only major illnesses spreading, so if colds don\u2019t infect the most people, then if flu doesn\u2019t, strep will. Moreover, flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if flu doesn\u2019t infect the most, strep will?",

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": " Explanation: The argument is based on a conditional statement that states that if one thing happens (flu does not infect the most), then another thing must happen (strep will). This is an example of modus tollens, which is a valid form of deductive reasoning. Modus tollens has the following structure: If P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P. In this case, P is flu infecting the most and Q is strep being the second most prevalent illness. The argument also uses the fact that there are only three major illnesses spreading, which eliminates other possibilities for the ranking of the illnesses.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
