    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it\u2019s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be. Moreover, it\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

            "content": " Explanation: The argument given in the question follows a logical pattern of reasoning known as modus ponens. It states that if A (apples) are the most purchased fruits and B (bananas) are likely to be second, then C (oranges) must be third. If apples are not the top-selling fruit, it logically follows that oranges will be third in sales.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
