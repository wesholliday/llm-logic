    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": " Explanation: The given information states that Tennessee is projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. This implies that Tennessee leads growth, and if Georgia does not lead growth, then Missouri will. Additionally, it is stated that Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia won't. Therefore, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, it follows logically that Missouri will have the strongest job growth this year in the US.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
