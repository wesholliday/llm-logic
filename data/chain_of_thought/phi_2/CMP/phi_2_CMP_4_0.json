    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Priya, Julian, and Diego have the most impressive resumes for an open management position. The hiring manager thinks it\u2019s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn\u2019t get the offer, then if Priya doesn\u2019t, Diego will. Moreover, it\u2019s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn\u2019t get the offer, Diego will?",

            "content": " Explanation: The given information states that if Julian does not receive the offer, then Diego has a higher chance of getting it. Additionally, it's mentioned that Priya is more likely to be offered the role than Julian. Therefore, if Priya fails to secure the position, it implies that Julian will also not get the offer since he was ranked lower in terms of likelihood. Hence, it can be concluded that Diego has a higher chance of getting the role if Priya doesn't receive the offer.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
