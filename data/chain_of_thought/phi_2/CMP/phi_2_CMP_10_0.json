    "user_prompt": "Suppose that spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons. Forecasts show it's likely most vacations this year will happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with many fewer happening in the winter. These are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. Moreover, spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will?",

            "content": " Explanation: The argument is valid because it follows a logical pattern of reasoning. If spring has the most vacations, then summer must come next in line since they are the top three seasons. Therefore, if spring does not have the most vacations, then winter would be the season with the least number of vacations.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
