Contraposition is when you switch the subject and predicate of a conditional statement and negate both sides. In this case, the original statement is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" The contrapositive would be \"If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\" Since we know that Kate did not eat salad, we can conclude that Ben did not eat pasta.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
