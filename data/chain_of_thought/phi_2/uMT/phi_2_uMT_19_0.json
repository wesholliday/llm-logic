            "content": " Explanation: We can use a method called contraposition to solve this problem. Contraposition is when you switch the subject and predicate of a conditional statement and negate both sides. In this case, the original statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" The contrapositive would be \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\" Since we know that Jen did not watch basketball, we can conclude that Tom did not watch football.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
