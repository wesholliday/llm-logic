            "content": " Explanation: We can use a process of elimination to determine if Lisa bought the red shirt or not. Since Mark did not buy the blue shirt, he must have bought either the red or green shirt. However, since Lisa and Mark cannot both buy the same color shirt, we know that Lisa did not buy the red shirt because it would mean that Mark also bought the red shirt, which is not possible. Therefore, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
