            "content": " Explanation: We can use a method called contraposition to solve this problem. Contraposition is when you switch the subject and predicate of a conditional statement and negate both sides. In this case, the original statement is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" The contrapositive would be \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\" Since we know that Amy did not play tennis, we can conclude that Jeff did not play basketball.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
