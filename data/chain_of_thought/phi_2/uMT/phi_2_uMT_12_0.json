Contraposition is when you switch the subject and predicate of a conditional statement and negate both sides. In this case, the original statement is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" The contrapositive would be \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\" Since we know that Lucy did not go to the zoo, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
