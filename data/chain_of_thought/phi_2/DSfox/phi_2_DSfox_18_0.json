In this case, if the shank is not nugged, then it must be plooked according to the first condition. However, we cannot infer anything about the second condition as there is no information given about whether the shank is nugged or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the shank is plooked based on this statement alone.\nAnswer: No\n",
