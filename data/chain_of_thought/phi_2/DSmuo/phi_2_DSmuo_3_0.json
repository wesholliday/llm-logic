            "content": " Explanation: The given statement is a disjunction, which means it presents two options. One option is that the keys are in the drawer and the other option is that they must be dangling in the cabinet. Since the first part of the statement says \"It's not the case\" that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet, we can infer that the keys cannot be dangling in the cabinet. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the keys are in the drawer.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
