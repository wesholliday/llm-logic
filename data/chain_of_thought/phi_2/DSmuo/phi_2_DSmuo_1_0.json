From these two statements, we cannot directly infer whether Fido is inside or not. However, if we assume that Fido is not in the garden (as stated in the first statement), then it follows logically that Fido must be inside (as stated in the second statement). Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
