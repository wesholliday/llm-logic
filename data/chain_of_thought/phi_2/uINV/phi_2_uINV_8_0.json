This means that whenever the vampire is awake, the mummy must also be awake. However, it does not necessarily mean that if the vampire is not awake, the mummy will not be awake. There could be other factors at play that would cause the mummy to still be awake even if the vampire was not.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
