            "content": " Explanation: This is a conditional statement in logic where the first part (if-clause) states a condition and the second part (then-clause) gives the result of that condition being met. In this case, the if-clause is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and the then-clause is \"Sue was at the wedding\". The statement can be written as: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding. This is because the conditional statement states that if the first part (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the second part (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true. Therefore, if the first part is false (Mary was not at the wedding), then the second part must also be false (Sue was not at the wedding).\n",
