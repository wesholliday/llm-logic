The contrapositive of this statement would be \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\" Since the original statement does not provide any information about whether or not Amy played tennis when Jeff did not play basketball, we cannot infer that she did not play tennis. Therefore, the answer is no.\n",
