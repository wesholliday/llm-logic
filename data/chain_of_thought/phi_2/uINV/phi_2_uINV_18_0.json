            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" implies a conditional relationship between the material of the doll and the material of the truck. This means that if the doll is made of plastic, then the truck must be made of metal. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the doll is not made of plastic, then the truck cannot be made of metal. There could still be other materials for the truck to be made of.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
