            "content": " Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement in which the antecedent (if the shirt was cotton) implies the consequent (then the pants were denim). This means that if the first part of the statement is true, then the second part must also be true. However, this does not mean that the opposite is always true. Just because the shirt was not made of cotton, it does not necessarily mean that the pants were not made of denim. There could be other materials used for making pants besides denim.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim. The given statement only establishes a relationship between the material of the shirt and the material of the pants when the shirt is cotton. It does not provide any information about what other materials could be used for making pants. Therefore, it is possible for the pants to still be made of denim even if the shirt was not cotton.\n",
