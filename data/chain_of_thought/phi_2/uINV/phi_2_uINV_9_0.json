            "content": " Explanation: This is a conditional statement in logic where the first part (if-clause) states a condition and the second part (then-clause) gives the result of that condition. In this case, if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. However, we cannot infer anything about what would happen if Lisa did not buy the red shirt because there is no information given about what Mark would do in that scenario.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt. The statement only tells us what happens when Lisa buys the red shirt, but it does not provide any information about what would happen if she did not buy it. Therefore, we cannot make a logical conclusion based on this information alone.\n",
