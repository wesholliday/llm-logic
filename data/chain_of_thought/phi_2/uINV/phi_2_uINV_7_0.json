            "content": " Explanation: This is a conditional statement in logic where the first part (if-part) states a condition and the second part (then-part) gives the result of that condition being met. In this case, the condition is \"Alex finished the race\" and the result is \"Chris finished the race\". \nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race. This is because the conditional statement states that if the first part (Alex finishing the race) is true, then the second part (Chris finishing the race) must also be true. Therefore, if the first part is false (Alex did not finish the race), then the second part cannot be true either.\n",
