            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo. This is because if Joe went to the park and Lucy went to the zoo, then according to the first statement, it would mean that both of them went to different places. However, since we know that Joe did not go to the park, it means that he must have gone to the zoo instead. Therefore, based on this information, we can conclude that Lucy also did not go to the zoo.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
