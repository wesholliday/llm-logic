            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that the wolf was not in the den. This is because if the bear was in the cave and the wolf was in the den, then according to the given statements, they would both be present in their respective locations. However, since it is stated that the bear was not in the cave, it means that the bear could have been anywhere else, including outside of the den where the wolf was supposed to be. Therefore, we can conclude that the wolf was not in the den.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
