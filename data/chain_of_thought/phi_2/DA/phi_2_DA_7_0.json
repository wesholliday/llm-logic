From these two statements, we cannot directly infer that \"Chris did not finish the race\". This is because there could be other reasons why Alex did not finish the race, such as an injury or a disqualification. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about Chris's performance based on the given information.\nAnswer: No\n",
