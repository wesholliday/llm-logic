            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that the unicorn was not in the forest. This is because if the griffin was in the forest and the unicorn was also in the forest (as stated in the first statement), then it would be impossible for the griffin to not be in the forest (since it is already there). Therefore, based on the second statement that says the griffin was not in the forest, we can conclude that the unicorn must have been somewhere else.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
