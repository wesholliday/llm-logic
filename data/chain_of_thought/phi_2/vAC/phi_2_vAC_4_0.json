The first premise states that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. However, the second premise only tells us that the robot visited Jupiter, but it does not provide any information about whether or not the alien actually visited Mars. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the alien must have visited Mars based on the given premises.\nAnswer: No\n",
