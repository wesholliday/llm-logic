            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if the sprocket was daggled, then it was not cranked. This is because the statement \"if the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled\" implies a cause and effect relationship between the two actions. If one action (cranking) leads to the other action (not being daggled), then the opposite must also be true. Therefore, if the sprocket is daggled, it cannot have been cranked.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
