            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if the fribble is crinkled, it means that it was not snuggled. This is because the statement \"if the fribble was snuggled, then the fribble did not crinkle\" implies an inverse relationship between being snuggled and being crinkled. If one condition is true (snuggled), then the other must be false (not crinkled). Therefore, if the fribble is crinkled, it cannot have been snuggled.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
