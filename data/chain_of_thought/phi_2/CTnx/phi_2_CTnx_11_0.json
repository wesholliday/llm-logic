This is because of the contrapositive statement given in the question, which states that if the flug was not blummed, then it must have been zimmed. Therefore, if the opposite of this statement (the flug being zimmed) is true, then its converse (the flug being not blummed) must also be true.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
