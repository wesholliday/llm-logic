This is because of the contrapositive statement 'if p, then q', which states that if something is true (p), then its opposite must also be true (q). In this case, if the shank was plooked (p), then it cannot be nugged (not q). Therefore, if the shank was nugged (q), then it must not have been plooked (not p).\n",
