This is because of the contrapositive statement given in the question, which states that if the flugel was not blimmed, then it must have been zargled. Therefore, if the opposite of this statement (the flugel being zargled) is true, then the original statement (the flugel being blimmed) must also be false.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
