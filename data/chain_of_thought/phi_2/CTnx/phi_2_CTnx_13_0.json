This is because of the contrapositive statement \"if the glip was slogged, then the glip was not tragged\". The contrapositive of a conditional statement switches the hypothesis and conclusion, so in this case, if the glip was not tragged (hypothesis), then it must have been slogged (conclusion).\n",
