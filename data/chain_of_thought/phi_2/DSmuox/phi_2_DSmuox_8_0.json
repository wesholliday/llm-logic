            "content": " Explanation: The first premise states that the sprocket cannot be daggled, which means it cannot be in a state of being dangled. The second premise states that either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled. Since the sprocket cannot be daggled according to the first premise, and the only other option for the sprocket's state is being cranked, we can infer that the sprocket is indeed cranked.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
