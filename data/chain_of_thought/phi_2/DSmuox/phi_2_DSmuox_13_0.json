In this case, the first part is 'It's not the case that the glip must be tagged'. This means that the glip can either be tagged or it cannot be tagged. The second part is 'Either the glip is slogged or it must be tagged'. This means that if the glip is not tagged, then it must be slogged. Therefore, we can infer that the glip is slogged because if it were not, then it would not have been tagged according to the given statement.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
