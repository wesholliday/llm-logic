The premise states that if one gets enough sleep, they will not be tired, but it does not necessarily follow that if someone is not tired, then they must have gotten enough sleep. There could be other reasons why someone is not tired besides getting enough sleep, such as being physically active or taking medication. Therefore, the conclusion cannot logically follow from the premise.\nAnswer: No\n",
