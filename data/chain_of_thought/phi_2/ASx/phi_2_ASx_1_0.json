            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the snark was blimmed, then it flopped' implies that if a snark is blimmed, it will always result in it flopping. However, this does not necessarily mean that if a snark is both blimmed and sproinged, it will always result in it flopping. It is possible for the combination of being blimmed and sproinged to have different outcomes. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the snark was blimmed and sproinged, then it flopped' based on the given statement.\nAnswer: No\n",
