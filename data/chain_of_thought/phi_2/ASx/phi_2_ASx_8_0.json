However, the statement 'If the plink has morphed and it was misglommed, then it will tizzle' adds an additional condition - if the plink was also misglommed, it will still make a sound. Therefore, we can infer that if both conditions are met (plink is not a plink anymore and it was also misglommed), then it will tizzle.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
