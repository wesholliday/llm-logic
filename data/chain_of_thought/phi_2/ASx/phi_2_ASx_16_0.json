            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if both the trankle is sploofed and the drib is flanked, then the zorple will quibble. This is because the first statement implies that when the trankle is sploofed, the zorple will quibble. The second statement adds on to this by stating that when the drib is flanked, it also leads to the zorple quibbling. Therefore, if both conditions are met, we can infer that the zorple will quibble.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
