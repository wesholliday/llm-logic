In this case, we know that both A and B are true. \nAnswer: Yes, it follows that the vampire was awake because if the condition (A) is true, then the consequent (B) must also be true in order for the statement to hold true. Since we know that both A and B are true, it logically follows that the vampire was also awake.\n",
