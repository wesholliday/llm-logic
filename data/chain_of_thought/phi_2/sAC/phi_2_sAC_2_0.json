            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" implies a conditional relationship between the two animals. This means that if one animal is present in the forest, then the other must also be present. However, we are given that only the unicorn is present in the forest, which does not necessarily mean that the griffin is also present. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the griffin was in the forest based on the information provided.\nAnswer: No\n",
