This means that if we know Sue was at the wedding, we can conclude that Mary must have been there as well. However, just because Sue was at the wedding does not necessarily mean that Mary was also present. It is possible that Sue went to the wedding alone or with someone else who was not Mary. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that Mary was at the wedding based solely on the fact that Sue was there.\nAnswer: No\n",
