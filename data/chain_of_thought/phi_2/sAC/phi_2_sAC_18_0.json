            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" implies a conditional relationship between the two objects. This means that if the first condition (the doll being plastic) is met, then the second condition (the truck being metal) must also be met. In this case, we are given that both conditions are true - the doll is indeed plastic and the truck is indeed metal. Therefore, based on the conditional relationship stated in the original statement, it can be concluded that the doll was indeed plastic.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
