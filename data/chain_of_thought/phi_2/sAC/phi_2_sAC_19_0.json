            "content": " Explanation: If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This means that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen would not have watched basketball. However, we know that Jen did watch basketball, so this does not necessarily mean that Tom also watched football. It is possible that Tom watched a different sport or activity instead of football.\nAnswer: No, it does not follow that Tom watched football. Just because Jen watched basketball and if Tom watched football then Jen would have watched basketball, it does not mean that Tom actually did watch football. There could be other reasons why Jen watched basketball.\n",
