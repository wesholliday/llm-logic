            "content": " Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement with two parts - \"if the doll was plastic\" and \"then the truck was metal.\" This means that whenever the first part is true, the second part must also be true. However, it does not necessarily mean that if the second part is true, then the first part must also be true.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic based on the given statement. The statement only shows a one-way relationship between the two parts - if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. It does not provide any information about the reverse relationship. Therefore, it is possible for the truck to be metal and the doll to be plastic, but it is also possible for the truck to be metal and the doll to be a different material.\n",
