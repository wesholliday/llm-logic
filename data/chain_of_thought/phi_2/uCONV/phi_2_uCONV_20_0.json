            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement with an antecedent (the apple being red) and a consequent (the banana being yellow). This means that whenever the antecedent is true, the consequent must also be true. However, this does not mean that if the consequent is true, the antecedent must also be true. In other words, just because the banana was yellow does not necessarily mean that the apple was red.\nAnswer: No. The statement only tells us that when the apple is red, the banana is yellow. It does not provide any information about what happens if the banana is yellow and the apple is not red. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\n",
