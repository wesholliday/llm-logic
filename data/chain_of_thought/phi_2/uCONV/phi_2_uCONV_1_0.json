            "content": " Explanation: This is a conditional statement in logic where the first part (if-clause) states a condition and the second part (then-clause) states what happens when the condition is met. In this case, the condition is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and the result is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was also at the wedding. This is because the conditional statement states that if one event (Mary being at the wedding) occurs, then another event (Sue being at the wedding) will also occur. Therefore, if Sue was at the wedding, it must mean that Mary was also there.\n",
