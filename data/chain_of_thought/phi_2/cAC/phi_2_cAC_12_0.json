From these two statements, we cannot directly infer that Joe went to the park. This is because there could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo, such as her own personal preference or a group outing with friends. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Joe went to the park based on the given information.\nAnswer: No\n",
