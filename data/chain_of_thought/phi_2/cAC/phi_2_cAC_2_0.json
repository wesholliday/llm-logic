            "content": " Explanation: The first statement establishes a relationship between the presence of a griffin and the presence of a unicorn in the forest. It states that if there is a griffin, then there must also be a unicorn. The second statement confirms that there is indeed a unicorn present in the forest. Therefore, we can conclude that since the unicorn was in the forest, it follows logically that the griffin must have been there as well.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
