The second statement tells us that either something is vreebled or it is plagged. Since the two statements contradict each other, we can conclude that the thing in question must not be both vreebled and plagged at the same time. Therefore, if the thing is a smonk, then it cannot be vreebled.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
