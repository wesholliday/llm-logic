            "content": " Explanation: The first statement, 'The wug is not garbled,' implies that the wug is not in a state of disarray. The second statement, 'Either the wug is sproined or it is garbled,' suggests that there are two possible states for the wug - either it is sproined (meaning it has been cleaned) or it is garbled (meaning it is dirty). Therefore, we can infer that if the wug is not garbled, then it must be sproined.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
