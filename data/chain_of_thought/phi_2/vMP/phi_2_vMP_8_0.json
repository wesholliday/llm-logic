            "content": " Explanation: This argument is not logically valid because it commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The first premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake. However, just because the vampire was awake does not necessarily mean that the mummy was also awake. There could be other factors at play that caused the mummy to be awake or asleep. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the mummy was awake based on the given premises.\nAnswer: No\n",
