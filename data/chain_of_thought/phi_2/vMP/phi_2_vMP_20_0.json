            "content": " Explanation: This argument is not logically valid because it commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The first premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, just because the apple was red does not necessarily mean that the banana was also yellow. There could be other reasons why the banana was yellow, such as being ripe or artificially colored. Therefore, the conclusion that the banana was yellow cannot be logically inferred from the premises.\nAnswer: No\n",
