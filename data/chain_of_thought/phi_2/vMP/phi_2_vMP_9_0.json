            "content": " Explanation: This argument is not logically valid because it commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. However, just because Lisa did buy the red shirt does not necessarily mean that Mark also bought the blue shirt. There could be other reasons why Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, such as he already had one or he changed his mind. Therefore, we cannot conclude from the premises that Mark bought the blue shirt.\nAnswer: No\n",
