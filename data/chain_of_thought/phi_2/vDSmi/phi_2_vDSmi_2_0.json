            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of a disjunctive syllogism, which has the following structure: If A or B, then C. Not B, therefore not A. In this case, A represents 'the book is on the shelf', B represents 'the book must be resting on the table', and C represents 'the book is in one of these two places'. The first premise states that either A or B is true, which means that if we know for sure that the book is not resting on the table (not B), then we can conclude that it must be on the shelf (A). This argument is logically valid because it follows the rules of disjunctive syllogism.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
