            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of a disjunctive syllogism, which has the following structure: If A or B, then C. Not B, therefore not A. In this case, A represents 'the toy is in the toy box', B represents 'it must be sitting on the shelf', and C represents 'the toy is in the toy box'. The first premise states that either A or B is true, which means that if we know one of them to be false, then the other must be true. The second premise denies B, which means that it cannot be true. Therefore, by modus tollens (a valid form of deductive reasoning), we can conclude that A must be true, meaning that the toy is in the toy box.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
