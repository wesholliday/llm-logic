            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of a disjunctive syllogism, which has the following structure: If A or B is true, then C must be true. In this case, A represents \"the scarf is stuffed in my backpack\", B represents \"the scarf is draped on the coat rack\", and C represents \"the scarf is not draped on the coat rack\". The first premise states that either A or B is true, which means that if we know one of them to be false, then the other must be true. The second premise states that B is false, which means that A must be true in order for the conclusion to follow logically. Therefore, this argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
