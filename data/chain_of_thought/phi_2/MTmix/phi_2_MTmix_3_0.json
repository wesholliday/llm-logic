However, the second statement suggests that there is a possibility that the splat did not quank. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the splat was not morphed based on these two statements alone. \nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the splat was not morphed. The first statement only implies that if the splat was morphed, it must have quanked. It does not provide any information about what would happen if the splat was not morphed. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive conclusion based on these two statements alone.\n",
