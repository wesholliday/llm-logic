Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude whether the fleeg was bluttered or not based on these two statements alone. \nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the fleeg was not bluttered. The first statement only implies a possibility of the fleeg being surned, but it does not rule out the possibility of it being bluttered. Therefore, we cannot make any definite conclusions about whether the fleeg was bluttered or not based on these two statements alone.\n",
