The second statement says that the shoes aren't lined up by the door, which means that if the shoes were lined up by the door, then the first statement would be false. Therefore, we can infer that the shoes must be in the closet because if they weren't, then the first statement would be true and the second statement would also be true.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
