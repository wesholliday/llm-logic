However, this does not necessarily mean that if the garage is flooded, the car will still be safe. There could be other factors at play, such as the level of flooding or the structural integrity of the garage. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the car is in the garage and the garage is flooding, then it is safe.\nAnswer: No\n",
