This is because the first statement establishes a cause-and-effect relationship between the oven being on and the kitchen being warm. The second statement adds another condition to this relationship, but since it is already established that the oven being on leads to a warm kitchen, we can infer that if both conditions are met, then the kitchen will still be warm.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
