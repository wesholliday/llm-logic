This is because the first statement establishes a cause-and-effect relationship between striking the match and lighting it. The second statement adds an additional condition to this relationship by stating that the match must also be soaked in water for it to light. Therefore, if both conditions are met (match struck and soaked in water), then we can infer that the match will light.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
