However, it does not tell us anything about what happens when the alien does not visit Mars. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about whether or not the robot visited Jupiter based on this information alone.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the alien did not visit Mars. The first statement only tells us what would happen if the alien visited Mars, but it does not tell us anything about what happens when the alien does not visit Mars. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about whether or not the robot visited Jupiter based on this information alone.\n",
