            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of a disjunctive syllogism, which has the following structure: If A or B, then C. Not-A. Therefore, not-B. In this case, A represents Fido being inside, B represents Fido being in the garden, and C represents the conclusion that Fido is inside. The first premise states that either A or B must be true, which means that if we know one of them to be false, then the other must be true. The second premise denies the truth of B, which means that it cannot be true. Therefore, by modus tollens (a valid form of deductive reasoning), we can conclude that not-A is true, which means that Fido is inside. Answer: Yes\n",
