            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of a disjunctive syllogism, which has the following structure: If A or B, then not C. In this case, A represents 'the keys are in the drawer', B represents 'they must be dangling in the cabinet', and C represents 'it's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet'. The conclusion is 'the keys are in the drawer'.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid. This is because if either A or B is true, then it cannot be both at the same time. In this case, since the second premise states that C is not true (i.e., the keys must not be dangling in the cabinet), we can conclude that A must also be true (i.e., the keys are in the drawer).\n",
