            "content": " Explanation: This argument is not logically valid because it commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The premise states that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake. However, just because the mummy was awake does not necessarily mean that the vampire was also awake. There could be other reasons why the mummy was awake, such as being disturbed by something else in the room. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the vampire was awake based solely on the fact that the mummy was awake.\nAnswer: No\n",
