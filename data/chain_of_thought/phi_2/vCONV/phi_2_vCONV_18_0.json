            "content": " Explanation: This argument is not logically valid because it commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The premise states that if the doll was made of plastic, then the truck must be made of metal. However, just because the truck is made of metal does not necessarily mean that the doll was also made of plastic. There could have been other factors at play in determining the materials used for each toy. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the doll was plastic based solely on the fact that the truck was metal.\nAnswer: No\n",
