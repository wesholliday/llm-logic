The premise states that if Alex finishes the race, then Chris also finishes the race. However, the conclusion does not follow from this premise because there could be other reasons why Chris finished the face besides Alex finishing the race. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if Chris finished the face, then Alex finished the race based on the given premises.\nAnswer: No\n",
