            "content": " Explanation: This argument follows the logical structure of a conditional statement. If the premise 'if A, then B' is true, and if we know that B is also true, then we can conclude that A must be true as well. In this case, the premise states that if the bear was in the case (A), then the wolf was in the den (B). The conclusion follows from this premise because it states that if the wolf was in the den (B), then the bear was in the case (A). Therefore, this argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
