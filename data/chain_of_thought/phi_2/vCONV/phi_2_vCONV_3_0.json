The premise states that if the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. However, just because the book is a mystery novel does not necessarily mean that it was written by James. There could be other authors who write mystery novels as well. Therefore, the conclusion cannot be logically inferred from the given premises.\nAnswer: No\n",
