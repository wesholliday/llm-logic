The premise states that if Sue chooses pizza, then Bob will choose pasta. However, just because Bob chose pasta does not necessarily mean that Sue chose pizza. There could be other reasons why Bob chose pasta, such as personal preference or dietary restrictions. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that if Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza based on the given premise and conclusion.\nAnswer: No\n",
