From these two statements, we cannot directly infer whether the milk is on the counter or not. However, if we assume that the first statement is true, then the second statement would also have to be true for the argument to hold. This means that either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter. Therefore, we can conclude that the milk is on the counter.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
