This means that either the watch is charging somewhere else, such as on a dresser, or it was previously on the person's wrist but has since been removed and placed elsewhere. \nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser because if it were not, then it would still be on the person's wrist according to the second statement. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the watch is currently being charged on a dresser.\n",
