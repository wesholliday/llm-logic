            "content": " Explanation: The first statement implies that if the book is a mystery novel, it must have been written by James. However, the second statement contradicts this by suggesting that the book may not be a mystery novel. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude whether or not the book was written by James based on these two statements alone.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the book was not written by James. The first statement only implies that if the book is a mystery novel, it must have been written by James. It does not provide any information about books that are not mysteries or whether or not they were written by James. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about the author of the book based on these two statements alone.\n",
