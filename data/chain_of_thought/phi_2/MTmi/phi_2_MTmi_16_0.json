            "content": " Explanation: The first statement establishes a conditional relationship between the material of the shirt and the material of the pants. If the shirt is made of cotton, then it implies that the pants must be made of denim. However, the second statement introduces the possibility that the pants were not made of denim. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer whether or not the shirt was made of cotton based on these two statements alone.\nAnswer: No.\n",
