However, it is also stated that Chris might not have finished the face. This could mean that even though he did finish the race, he may have stopped before reaching the finish line or encountered some other obstacle. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether Alex finished the race or not based on this information alone.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n",
