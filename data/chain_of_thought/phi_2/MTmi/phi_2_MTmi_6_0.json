However, the second statement says that Bob might not have chosen pasta, which means there is a possibility that he could have chosen something else. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether or not Sue chose pizza based on this information alone.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that Sue did not choose pizza because there is still a possibility that she could have chosen it even though Bob might not have chosen pasta. \n",
