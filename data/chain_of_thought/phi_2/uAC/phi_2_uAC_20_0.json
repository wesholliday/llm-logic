In order to determine if we can infer that the apple was red, we need to check if the contrapositive is true. \nContrapositive: If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\nGiven that the banana was indeed yellow, we cannot conclude anything about the color of the apple as it could have been any other color. Therefore, we cannot infer that the apple was red based on the given information.\nAnswer: No\n",
