            "content": " Explanation: The given statements are in the form of conditional statements, where if one condition is met, then another condition must also be true. In this case, if the doll was plastic (condition 1), then the truck would have to be metal (condition 2). However, we do not know for sure that the doll was plastic or not, as there could be other factors at play.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the doll was plastic based on the given information. While it is true that if the doll was plastic, then the truck would have to be metal, we do not have enough evidence to confirm this statement. The fact that the truck was indeed made of metal does not necessarily mean that the doll must also be plastic. There could be other reasons why the truck was made of metal, such as durability or cost-effectiveness. Therefore, we cannot make a definite conclusion about the material of the doll based on the given information.\n",
