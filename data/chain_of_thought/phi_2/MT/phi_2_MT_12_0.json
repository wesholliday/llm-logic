This is because if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would have gone to the zoo according to the first statement. However, since it is stated in the second statement that Lucy did not go to the zoo, this means that Joe must also not have gone to the park as there are no other options for him to go to.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
