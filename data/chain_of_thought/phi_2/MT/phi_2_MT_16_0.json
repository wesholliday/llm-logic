            "content": " Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional statement \"if p, then q\" and its negation \"not q\". In this case, p represents the shirt being made of cotton and q represents the pants being made of denim. From the first statement, we can infer that if the shirt was not made of cotton (i.e., not p), then the pants were not made of denim (i.e., not q). However, the second statement tells us that the pants were not made of denim (not q). Therefore, based on these two statements, we cannot conclude whether or not the shirt was made of cotton (i.e., not p) as there is no direct information given about it.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the shirt was not made of cotton. The second statement only tells us that the pants were not made of denim, but it does not provide any information about the material of the shirt. Therefore, we cannot make a conclusion based on these two statements alone. \n",
