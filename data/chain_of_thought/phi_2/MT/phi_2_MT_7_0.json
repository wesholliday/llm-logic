From these two statements, we cannot directly infer that Alex did not finish the race. This is because there could be other reasons why Chris did not finish the race, such as an injury or a disqualification. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about whether Alex finished the race or not based on the given information.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n",
