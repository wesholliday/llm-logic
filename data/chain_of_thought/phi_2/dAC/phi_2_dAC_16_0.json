If the first part of the statement is true (the shirt was made of cotton), then the second part must also be true (the pants were made of denim). However, if we know that the second part is true (the pants were made of denim), it does not necessarily mean that the first part is true (the shirt was made of cotton). Therefore, we cannot deduce that the shirt was made of cotton based on the given information.\nAnswer: No\n",
