            "content": " Explanation: The first statement is a conditional statement that states if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake. The second statement confirms that the mummy is indeed awake. Therefore, based on these two statements, we can logically conclude that the vampire must be awake as well since it follows from the first statement that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy would not be awake either.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
