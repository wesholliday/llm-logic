    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a blimfet, a crongle, and a narzil are the leading bafwidgers. Experts expect the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most this year, followed by the crongle, with the narzil bafwidging much less. These are the only major bafwidgers, so if the crongle doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, then if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most. Moreover, the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most, and hence the crongle likely won\u2019t bafwidge the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will?",

            "content": " Explanation: The given information states that the blimfet is expected to bafwidge the most among the three major bafwidgers. It also mentions that if the crongle does not bafwidge the most, then the narzil will bafwidge the most. Additionally, it is stated that the blimfet is likely to bafwidge the most, implying that the crongle cannot be the leading bafwidger. Therefore, based on these premises, if the blimfet does not bafwidge the most, it logically follows that the narzil will bafwidge the most.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
