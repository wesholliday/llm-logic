    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jentil, a lomfry, and a darsal are the leading gardam suppliers this quarter. Industry analysts expect the jentil likely will sell the most gardam, followed by the lomfry, with the darsal significantly lower. These dominate gardam sales, so if the lomfry doesn\u2019t sell the most gardam, then if the jentil doesn\u2019t, the darsal will. Moreover, the jentil likely will lead gardam sales and hence the lomfry likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the jentil doesn\u2019t lead gardam sales, the darsal will?",

            "content": " Explanation: The given information states that the jentil leads gardam sales and the lomfry does not sell more than the jentil. If the jentil does not lead gardam sales, then it is likely that the lomfry will be the leading supplier since it cannot sell less than the jentil. However, there is no information given about the darsal's position in relation to the other two suppliers. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude whether or not the darsal will lead gardam sales if the jentil does not.\nAnswer: Uncertain\n",
