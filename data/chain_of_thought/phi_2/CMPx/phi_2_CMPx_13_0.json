    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantug, a loperit, and a frallon are shortlisted for Blither of the Year. Industry watchers consider the fantug the front runner, followed by the loperit, while the frallon is a heavy underdog. Since these are the only products in contention, if the loperit doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the fantug doesn\u2019t win, the frallon will win. Moreover, the fantug likely will win the award and hence the loperit likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantug doesn't win Blither of the Year, the frallon will?",

It also says that the fantug is likely to win and hence the loperit is unlikely to win. Therefore, it can be inferred that if the fantug doesn't win, the frallon has a higher chance of winning.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
