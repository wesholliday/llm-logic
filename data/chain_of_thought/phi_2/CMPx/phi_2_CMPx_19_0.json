    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a garplex, a beelhet, and a peedonk are competing to be domer of the year. Experts think the garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, with the peedonk having a much lower chance. Since these are the only domer candidates, if the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer. Moreover, it is likely the garplex will become domer and hence the beelhet likely won\u2019t become domer. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will?",

Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

It also mentions that the garplex is most likely to win and hence the beelhet is unlikely to become domer. Therefore, it can be inferred that if the garplex doesn't become domer, the peedonk has a higher chance of becoming domer since the beelhet won't have a chance.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
