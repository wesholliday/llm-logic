    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantole, a dribban, and a cruggit are the most downloaded fillip apps this month. Market watchers expect the fantole likely will retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit download rate significantly lower. These lead the downloads, so if the dribban isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn\u2019t, the cruggit will be. Moreover, the fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fantole isn\u2019t the most downloaded, the cruggit will be?",

            "content": " Explanation: The given information states that the fantole is expected to retain its top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban and then the cruggit. This implies that if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, it means either the dribban or the cruggit could be the most downloaded. However, since the fantole likely will lead downloads, it's unlikely for the cruggit to be the most downloaded. Therefore, it is likely that if the fantole isn\u2019t the most downloaded, the cruggit will be.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
