    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

If the cramen does not receive the zulision, then it implies that either the jantiz or the sulect will get it. Since the jantiz is likely to get the zulision and hence the cramen won't, it follows logically that if the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, the sulect will have a higher chance of receiving it.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
