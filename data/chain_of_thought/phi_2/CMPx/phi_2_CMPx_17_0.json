    "user_prompt": "Suppose a flinker, a dringen, and a n\u00fcffen have the best projections to have a breakout season next year. Talent scouts believe it's highly probable the flinker will have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen, while the n\u00fcffen is an outside shot. Since these are the only top prospects, if the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. Moreover, scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season and hence the dringen likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will?",

            "content": " Explanation: The given information states that if the dringen does not have a breakout season, then the n\u00fcffen will. It also says that if the flinker has a breakout season, then the dringen is unlikely to have one. Therefore, it can be inferred that if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the dringen won't either. Since the dringen not having a breakout season implies the n\u00fcffen's breakout season, it follows that if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will likely have one.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
