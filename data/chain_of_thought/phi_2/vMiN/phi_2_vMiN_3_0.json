In this case, P represents 'The book might have been written by James', and Q represents 'It's not the case that the book must have been written by James'. The argument is logically valid because it follows the rules of hypothetical syllogism, which state that if the antecedent (P) is false, then the conclusion (not P) can be true.\n",
