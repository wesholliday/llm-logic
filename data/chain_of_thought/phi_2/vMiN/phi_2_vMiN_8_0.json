            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of a conditional statement, where the premise states that if the vampire was not awake, then it cannot be concluded that they were asleep. The conclusion follows from this premise by negating the antecedent (the vampire being awake) and asserting that the consequent (the vampire must have been asleep) is false.\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid because if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true. In other words, if it is not the case that the vampire was awake, then it cannot be concluded that they were asleep.\n",
