In this case, P represents \"Mary might have been at the wedding,\" and Q represents \"It's the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\" The conclusion states that it is not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid because it follows the structure of a hypothetical syllogism, which is considered to be one of the most basic and reliable forms of deductive reasoning.\n",
