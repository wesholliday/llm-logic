However, this does not necessarily mean that if someone else screams while wearing earplugs, their ears will still be affected. \nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that if someone screams and I am wearing earplugs, it will hurt my ears. The statement only applies to the speaker's own ears being in pain when they scream. It does not take into account any external factors such as earplugs or other people screaming. Therefore, even if someone else is screaming while wearing earplugs, their ears may still be protected from the sound.\n",
