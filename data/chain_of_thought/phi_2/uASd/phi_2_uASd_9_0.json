It only states that if the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A. Turning in the essay late may affect the grade, but it cannot be determined solely based on the information given.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the student will receive an A if their essay is well-written and turned in late. The statement only provides information about the effect of a well-written essay on the grade, not the impact of turning it in late.\n",
