This is because if either of the two statements are true, then it must also be true for both to be combined in this way. Therefore, since one statement says the shank might not be nugged and the other states that the shank is plooked or it must be nugged, we can conclude that the shank is indeed plooked.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
