            "content": " Explanation: The given statements are conditional statements that establish a relationship between two events. If one event occurs, it implies that the other event also occurred. In this case, if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf must be in the den. However, we cannot infer anything about the location of the bear based on these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the bear was not in the cave. The given statements only establish a relationship between the bear and the wolf's locations, but they do not provide any information about the bear's location. Therefore, it is possible for the bear to be in the cave even if the wolf is in the den.\n",
