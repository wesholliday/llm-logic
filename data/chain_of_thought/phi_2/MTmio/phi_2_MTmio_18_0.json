            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'The truck might not have been metal' implies that there is a possibility for the truck to be made of something other than metal. If this were true and the doll was plastic, then according to the second statement, the truck must have been metal. However, since we do not know if the truck was actually made of metal or not, we cannot make any conclusions about the material of the doll based on these two statements alone.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic. The given information does not provide enough evidence to support this conclusion.\n",
