If Kate did not eat salad and if Ben ate pasta, then it is possible that Kate could have eaten something else instead of salad. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether or not Ben ate pasta. \nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that Ben did not eat pasta. The given information only states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. It does not provide any information about what Kate actually ate. So, it is possible that Ben could have eaten pasta and Kate could have eaten something else instead of salad.\n",
