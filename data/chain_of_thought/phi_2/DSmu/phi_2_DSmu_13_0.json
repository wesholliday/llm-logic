This means that there are two possibilities for where the toy could be - either in the toy box or on the bookshelf. The second statement says that it's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf, which eliminates one possibility and leaves us with only one option - the toy is in the toy box.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
