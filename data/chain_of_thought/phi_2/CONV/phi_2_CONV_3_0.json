In this case, the antecedent is \"If the book was written by James\", and the consequent is \"then the book is a mystery novel\". If we know that the book is indeed a mystery novel, it means that the antecedent is false, since there are other possible authors for the book besides James. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about whether or not the book was written by James based on the given statement.\nAnswer: No\n",
