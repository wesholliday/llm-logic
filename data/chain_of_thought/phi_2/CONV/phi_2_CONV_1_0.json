            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was also at the wedding. This is because of the transitive property in logic, which states that if A implies B and B implies C, then A implies C. In this case, \"Mary was at the wedding\" implies \"Sue was at the wedding\", and \"Sue was at the wedding\" implies \"Mary was at the wedding\". Therefore, we can conclude that \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was also at the wedding\".\nAnswer: Yes\n",
