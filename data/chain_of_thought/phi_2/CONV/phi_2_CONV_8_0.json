            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was also awake because of the transitive property in logic. If A implies B and B implies C, then A implies C. In this case, 'the vampire was awake' is equivalent to 'A', 'the mummy was awake' is equivalent to 'B', and 'if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is equivalent to 'A implies B'. Therefore, we can conclude that if the vampire was awake (A), then the mummy was also awake (B).\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
