            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if Jen watched basketball, then Tom also watched football based on the given statement. This is because of the transitive property in logic, which states that if A implies B and B implies C, then A implies C. In this case, watching football (A) implies watching basketball (B), and watching basketball (B) implies watching football (C). Therefore, we can conclude that if Jen watched basketball (B), then Tom also watched football (C).\nAnswer: Yes\n",
