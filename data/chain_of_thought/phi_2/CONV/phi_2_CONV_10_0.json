This is because of the logical principle of contraposition, which states that if a conditional statement is true, its converse (the statement with the words \"if\" and \"then\" reversed) is also true. In this case, the original statement can be rewritten as \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside.\" Since we know that the original statement is true, we can conclude that the converse is also true.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
