            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of a conditional statement in logic. The first part of the statement, \"if Lisa bought the red shirt\", is called the antecedent and the second part, \"then Mark bought the blue shirt\", is called the consequent. In this case, we are given that the antecedent is true (Lisa did buy the red shirt), so we can use modus ponens to infer that the consequent must also be true (Mark did buy the blue shirt). Therefore, we can conclude that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
