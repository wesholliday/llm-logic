            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that the dreb was not spened. This is because if the dreb was vroombed (which means it was destroyed), then according to the second statement, it would have been spened (which means it was spared). However, since the first statement states that the dreb was not vroombed, we can conclude that it was not spened.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
