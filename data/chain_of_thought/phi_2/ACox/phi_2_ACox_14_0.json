In this case, if the fribble is snuggled (condition A), then it must also be crinked (condition B). However, we cannot infer that the fribble was snuggled based on the given information because there could be other reasons for it to be crinkled. Therefore, we cannot make a definite conclusion about whether the fribble was snuggled or not.\nAnswer: No.\n",
