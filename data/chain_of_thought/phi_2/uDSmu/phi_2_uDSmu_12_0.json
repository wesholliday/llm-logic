            "content": " Explanation: The first premise states that either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet. The second premise says that the jacket cannot be hanging in the closet. Therefore, by contraposition, if the jacket were not draped over the chair, then it would have to be hanging in the closet.
