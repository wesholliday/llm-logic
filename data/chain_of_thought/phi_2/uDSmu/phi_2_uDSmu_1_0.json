The second premise says that it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden. From these two premises, we can conclude that Fido is indeed inside because if he were outside in the garden, then the first premise would be false and the second premise would also be true. Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
