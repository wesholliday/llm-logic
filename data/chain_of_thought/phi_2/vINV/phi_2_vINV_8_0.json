            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of a conditional statement, where if one condition (the vampire being awake) is true, then another condition (the mummy being awake) must also be true. The conclusion follows from the premise because it states that if the first condition is not met (i.e., the vampire was not awake), then the second condition cannot be met either (i.e., the mummy was not awake). Therefore, this argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
