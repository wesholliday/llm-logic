Modus tollens states that if the conditional statement \"if A, then B\" is true and we know that B is false, then we can conclude that A must also be false. In this case, the premise \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is the conditional statement, and the conclusion \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train\" follows logically from the premise using modus tollens.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
