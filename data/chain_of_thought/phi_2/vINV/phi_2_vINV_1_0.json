            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of a conditional statement, where the premise states that if one condition (Mary being at the wedding) is met, then another condition (Sue being at the wedding) must also be met. The conclusion follows from this premise by stating that if Mary was not present at the wedding, then Sue could not have been there either. This argument is logically valid because it adheres to the rules of conditional statements and does not contain any fallacies or errors in reasoning.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
