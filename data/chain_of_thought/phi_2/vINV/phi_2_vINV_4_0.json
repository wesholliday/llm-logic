The argument is also in the form of denying the consequent, which means that if the consequent is false, then the antecedent must be false as well.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid because it follows the rules of conditional statements and denying the consequent. If the alien did not visit Mars (the consequent is false), then according to the argument, the robot did not visit Jupiter (the antecedent is also false). This means that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter, which is what the premise states. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n",
