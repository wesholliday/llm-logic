            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of modus tollens, which is a valid logical form. Modus tollens states that if P implies Q and not Q is true, then not P must also be true. In this case, the premise \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" can be represented as P \u2192 Q, where P represents the statement \"the book was written by James\" and Q represents the statement \"the book is a mystery novel.\" The conclusion \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel\" can be represented as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ. Since the premise states that if the book was written by James (P), then it must be a mystery novel (Q), and we know that the book was not written by James (\u00acP), then we can conclude that the book is not a mystery novel (\u00acQ). Therefore, this argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
