            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of a conditional statement, where if one condition (Tom watching football) is met, then another condition (Jen watching basketball) must also be met. The premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball, and the conclusion follows from this by stating that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball. This argument is logically valid because it follows the rules of conditional statements, where the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
