            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of a modus tollens, which is a valid deductive argument. Modus tollens has the following structure: If P then Q; Not Q; Therefore, not P. In this case, P represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q represents \"Sue must have been at the wedding\". The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding (P), then Sue must have been there as well (Q). The second premise denies that Sue had to be at the wedding (not Q). Therefore, we can conclude that Mary did not attend the wedding (not P).\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
