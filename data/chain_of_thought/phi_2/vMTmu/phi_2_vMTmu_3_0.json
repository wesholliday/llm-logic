            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of modus tollens, which is a valid form of deductive reasoning. Modus tollens states that if P implies Q, and it's not the case that Q, then it must be the case that not P. In this argument, P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book must be a mystery novel\". The first premise establishes that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, the second premise states that Q is false, which means that P cannot be true either. Therefore, it follows logically that not P (i.e., the book was not written by James) must be true.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
