            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of modus tollens, which is a valid logical form. Modus tollens states that if P implies Q, and it's not the case that Q, then it must be the case that P is false. In this argument, P is \"the vampire was awake\" and Q is \"the mummy must have been awake\". The first premise establishes that if the vampire was awake (P), then the mummy must also be awake (Q). However, the second premise states that it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake (not Q). Therefore, we can conclude that it's not the case that the vampire was awake (not P) using modus tollens.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
