            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of a modus tollens, which is a valid deductive argument. Modus tollens has the following structure: If P then Q; Not Q; Therefore, not P. In this case, P represents \"the car was red\" and Q represents \"the truck must have been blue\". The first premise states that if the car was red (P), then the truck must have been blue (Q). The second premise denies that the truck must have been blue (not Q). Therefore, we can conclude that the car was not red (not P) using modus tollens.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
