            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of a modus tollens, which is a valid deductive argument. Modus tollens has the following structure: If P then Q; Not Q; Therefore, not P. In this case, P represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q represents \"the pants must have been denim\". The first premise states that if the shirt was cotton (P), then the pants must have been denim (Q). The second premise denies that the pants must be denim (not Q). Therefore, we can conclude that the shirt was not cotton (not P) using modus tollens.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
