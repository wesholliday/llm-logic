            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of modus tollens, which is a valid logical form. Modus tollens states that if P implies Q, and it's not the case that Q, then it must be the case that not P. In this argument, P is \"the griffin was in the forest\" and Q is \"the unicorn must have been in the forest\". The first premise establishes a conditional relationship between P and Q, while the second premise denies the truth of Q. Therefore, we can conclude that not P (i.e., the griffin was not in the forest).\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
