            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of a conditional statement, where the first premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. The second premise denies the antecedent of the conditional statement, which means it claims that Jen did not watch basketball. However, this does not necessarily mean that Tom did not watch football, as there could be other reasons why Jen did not watch basketball. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that Tom did not watch football based on these premises alone.\nAnswer: No\n",
