            "content": " Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional statement \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow.\" We also know that A is true, which means the apple was indeed red. Now we need to determine if we can infer that B is also true, meaning the banana was yellow.\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that the banana was yellow based on the given statements. Since the first statement says \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,\" and we know that A (the apple being red) is true, it logically follows that B (the banana being yellow) must also be true.\n",
