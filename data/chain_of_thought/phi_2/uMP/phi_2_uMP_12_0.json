We need to determine whether or not we can logically conclude that Lucy also went to the zoo based on these two pieces of information. \nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that Lucy went to the zoo. This is because if Joe went to the park (which he did), then according to the first statement, Lucy must have gone to the zoo as well. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that Lucy also visited the zoo.\n",
