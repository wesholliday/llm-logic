In this case, if the shirt was cotton (A), then the pants must have been denim (B). However, we cannot infer that the shirt was not cotton just because it's not the case that the pants were denim. The given statements only provide information about the relationship between the shirt and the pants, but they do not give any information about the shirt itself. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about the shirt based on the given statements.\nAnswer: No\n",
