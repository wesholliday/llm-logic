In this case, if the dog was inside (A), then the cat must have been outside (B). However, we cannot infer that the dog was not inside just because it's not the case that the cat was outside. There could be other reasons why the cat was not outside, such as being sick or sleeping. Therefore, we cannot make a definite conclusion about whether the dog was inside or not based on these two statements alone.\nAnswer: No.\n",
