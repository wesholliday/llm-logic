Similarly, if 'Mary was at the wedding' is true, then 'Sue must have been there' is also true. However, we cannot infer anything about whether Mary was at the wedding or not based on these statements alone.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding. The given statements only provide information about Sue's presence at the wedding and do not mention anything about Mary's attendance. Therefore, it is possible for both Sue and Mary to have been present at the wedding. \n",
