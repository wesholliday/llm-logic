            "content": " Explanation: The given statements are in the form of conditional propositions. If 'A' is true, then 'B' must also be true. In this case, if the doll was plastic (A), then the truck must have been metal (B). However, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic just because it's not the case that the truck was made of metal. There could be other reasons why the truck wasn't made of metal, such as being a different type of vehicle or being made from a different material altogether.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic based on the given statements. The statement 'It's not the case that the truck must have been metal' does not provide enough information to make this inference. We need more evidence or additional statements to determine whether the doll was made of plastic or not.\n",
