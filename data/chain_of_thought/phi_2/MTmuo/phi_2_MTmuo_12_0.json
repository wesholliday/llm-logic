However, it does not say anything about what happens if Lucy didn't go to the zoo. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about whether or not Joe went to the park based on this information alone.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park. The first statement only tells us that if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe would have gone to the park. It does not provide any information about what happens if Lucy didn't go to the zoo. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about whether or not Joe went to the park based on this information alone.\n",
