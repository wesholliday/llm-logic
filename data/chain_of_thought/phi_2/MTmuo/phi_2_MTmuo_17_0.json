However, it is not stated that Kate had to eat salad. Therefore, we cannot infer whether or not Ben ate pasta based on the given information.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that Ben did not eat pasta. The given statements only provide information about the relationship between Ben and Kate's food choices, but do not give any direct information about Ben's own food choice.\n",
