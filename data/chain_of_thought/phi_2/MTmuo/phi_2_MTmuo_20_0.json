In this case, P represents \"the banana must have been yellow\" and Q represents \"the apple was red\". From the first statement, we know that if the banana was not yellow (\u00acP), then it does not necessarily mean that the apple was not red (\u00acQ). However, from the second statement, we can infer that if the apple was red (Q), then the banana must have been yellow (P). Therefore, we cannot conclude that the apple was not red based on the given statements.\nAnswer: No\n",
