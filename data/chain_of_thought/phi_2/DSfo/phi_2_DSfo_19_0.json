The second statement gives us two possibilities for where the watch could be - either it is on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser. Since we know that the watch cannot be both on his wrist and charging at the same time, we can infer that the only remaining possibility is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
