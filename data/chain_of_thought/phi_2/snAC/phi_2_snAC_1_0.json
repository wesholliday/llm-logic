            "content": " Explanation: Yes, if both statements are true, then it follows logically that Mary must have been at the wedding as well. This is because the first statement establishes a conditional relationship between Mary and Sue being at the wedding, meaning that if one of them was there, the other must also be present. Since we know for sure that Sue was at the wedding (the second statement), it follows that Mary must have been there as well to fulfill the condition set by the first statement.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
