In this case, p represents the color of the car being red and q represents the color of the truck being blue. Since both p and q are true, we can conclude that the conditional statement is true. However, it does not necessarily follow that the original statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is true because there could be other reasons for the truck to be blue besides the fact that the car was red.\n",
