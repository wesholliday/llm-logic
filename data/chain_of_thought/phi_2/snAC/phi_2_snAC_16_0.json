            "content": " Explanation: The given statement can be represented in symbolic form as \"C \u2192 D\" where C represents 'shirt was cotton' and D represents 'pants were denim'. We are also given the information that both C and D are true. To determine if it necessarily follows that C is true, we need to use the rule of modus ponens which states that if a conditional statement \"if P then Q\" is true and P is true, then Q must be true as well. In this case, since both C and D are true, we can apply modus ponens and conclude that C is also true. Therefore, it necessarily follows that the shirt was cotton.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
