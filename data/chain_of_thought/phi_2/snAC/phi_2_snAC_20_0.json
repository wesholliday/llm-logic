In this case, we are given that both the antecedent and consequent are true. However, just because the consequent is true does not necessarily mean that the antecedent must also be true. There could be other reasons why the banana was yellow, such as it being a different type of fruit or having been artificially dyed. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that the apple was red based on the given information.\nAnswer: No.\n",
