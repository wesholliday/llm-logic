            "content": " Explanation: In this scenario, we are given two statements - \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" and \"Chris finished the race\". We need to determine if it necessarily follows that \"Alex finished the race\" is true. To do so, we can use a truth table.\n\n| Statement 1 | Statement 2 | If A, then B | B |\n|-------------|-------------|--------------|---|\n| True        | True        | True         | T |\n| True        | False       | False        | F |\n| False       | True        | True         | T |\n| False       | False       | True         | T |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that when Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is true, then \"If A, then B\" is also true. However, this does not necessarily mean that \"A\" (Alex finished the race) is true. It could be possible that Alex did not finish the race but Chris still did. Therefore, it does not necessarily follow that \"Alex finished the race\" is true.\nAnswer: No\n",
