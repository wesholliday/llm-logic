The statement only tells us that if Tom watched football, then Jen would have also watched basketball. However, we do not know anything about whether or not Tom actually did watch football. It is possible that he did not watch football at all and therefore the statement does not provide enough information to determine whether or not he watched it.\nAnswer: No\n",
