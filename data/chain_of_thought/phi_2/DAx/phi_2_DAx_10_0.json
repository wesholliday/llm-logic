Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about whether or not the wug was garbled based on these two statements alone.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the wug was not garbled. The first statement only tells us what happens if a wug is sproinged, but it does not tell us anything about what happens if a wug is not sproinged. Therefore, we do not have enough information to make any conclusions about whether or not the wug was garbled.\n",
