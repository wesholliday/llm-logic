            "content": " Explanation: The given statement contains two conditions, one being that the toy is either sitting on the bookshelf or in the toy box. Since the first condition is not met (the toy is not sitting on the bookshelf), it can be concluded that the second condition must also not be met (the toy is not in the toy box).
