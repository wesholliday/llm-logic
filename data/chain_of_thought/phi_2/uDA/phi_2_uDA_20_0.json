            "content": " Explanation: The first statement establishes a conditional relationship between the color of an apple and the color of a banana. It states that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. However, it does not provide any information about what happens when the apple is not red. The second statement tells us that the apple was not red.\nBased on this information, we can infer that the banana could have been either yellow or a different color. We cannot definitively say whether the banana was yellow or not because there are no other conditions given to determine its color. Therefore, the answer is 'no'.\n",
