            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry. This is because of the logical principle of contraposition, which states that if a conditional statement (if-then) is true, its contrapositive (if-not) is also true. In this case, the original statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" can be rewritten as \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\" Since we know that the cake was not chocolate, we can conclude that the muffins were not blueberry.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
