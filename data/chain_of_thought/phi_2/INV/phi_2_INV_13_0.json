            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if the car was not red, then the truck was not blue based on the given statement. This is because of the logical principle of contraposition, which states that if a conditional statement is true, its converse (the statement with the words \"if\" and \"then\" reversed) is also true. In this case, the original statement can be rewritten as \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was red.\" Since we know that the car was not red, we can conclude that the truck was not blue.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
