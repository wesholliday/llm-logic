            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo. This is because of the logical principle of contrapositive, which states that if a conditional statement (if-then) is true, then its contrapositive (if not A then not B) is also true. In this case, the original statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" can be rewritten as \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\". Since we know that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo (as stated in the contrapositive), we can infer that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
