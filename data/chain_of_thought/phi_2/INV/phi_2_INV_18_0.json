This is because the statement follows a logical structure of \"if A, then B\", where A represents the doll being plastic and B represents the truck being metal. If A is false (the doll is not plastic), then the statement does not provide any information about the relationship between the doll and the truck, so we cannot make any conclusions about their materials.\n",
