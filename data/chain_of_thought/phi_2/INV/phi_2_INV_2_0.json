            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was also not in the forest. This is because of the conditional statement \"if A, then B\", where A represents the presence of the griffin and B represents the presence of the unicorn. If A is false (the griffin is not in the forest), then the entire statement becomes true regardless of the truth value of B. Therefore, we can conclude that if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was also not in the forest.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
