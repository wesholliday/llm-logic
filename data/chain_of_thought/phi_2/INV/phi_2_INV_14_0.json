            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den. This is because of the logical implication stated in the question - if one statement (the bear being in the cave) is true, then the other statement (the wolf being in the den) must also be true. Therefore, if the first statement is false (i.e., the bear was not in the cave), then we can conclude that the second statement is also false (i.e., the wolf was not in the den).\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
