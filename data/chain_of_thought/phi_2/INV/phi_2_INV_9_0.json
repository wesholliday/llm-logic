            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of a conditional statement in logic. If the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true for the whole statement to be true. However, if the first part is false, it does not necessarily mean that the second part is also false. It could still be possible for Mark to buy the blue shirt even if Lisa did not buy the red one. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\nAnswer: No\n",
