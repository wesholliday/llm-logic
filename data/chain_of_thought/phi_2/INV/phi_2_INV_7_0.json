This is because of the transitive property in logic, which states that if A implies B and B implies C, then A implies C. In this case, A represents Alex finishing the race, B represents Chris finishing the face, and C represents both Alex and Chris finishing their respective tasks. Since we know that if Alex finished the race (A), then Chris finished the face (B) is true, we can conclude that if Alex did not finish the race (not A), then Chris also did not finish the face (not B).\n",
