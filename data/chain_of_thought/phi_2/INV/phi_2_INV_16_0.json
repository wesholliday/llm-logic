            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if the shirt was not made of cotton, then the pants were not made of denim. This is because the statement \"if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" implies a cause and effect relationship between the two items. If one item (the shirt) changes, it will affect the other item (the pants). Therefore, if the shirt is no longer made of cotton, we can conclude that the pants are not made of denim.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
