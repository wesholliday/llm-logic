            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball based on the given statement. This is because of the logical principle of contrapositive, which states that if a conditional statement (if-then) is true, then its contrapositive (if not A then not B) is also true. In this case, the original statement can be rewritten as \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\". Therefore, if we know that Tom did not watch football, it follows logically that Jen did not watch basketball.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
