            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was also not at the wedding. This is because of the logical principle of contrapositive, which states that if a conditional statement (if-then) is true, then its contrapositive (if not-then) is also true. In this case, the original statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" can be rewritten as \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\". Since we know that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding (as stated in the contrapositive), we can infer that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding.\n",
