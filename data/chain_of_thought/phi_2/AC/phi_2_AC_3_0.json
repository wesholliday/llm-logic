If the book is a mystery novel, then it must have been written by James. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the book was written by James, it would be a mystery novel. It could also be a different genre or even an original work. Therefore, we cannot infer that the book was written by James based solely on the fact that it is a mystery novel.\nAnswer: No\n",
