            "content": " Explanation: The first statement implies a conditional relationship between the type of cake and the type of muffins. It suggests that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. However, this does not necessarily mean that if the muffins are not blueberry, then the cake cannot be chocolate.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate based on the second statement. If the muffins were not blueberry, it is possible that they could have been a different flavor, such as chocolate or another type of fruit. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the cake was not chocolate just because the muffins were not blueberry.\n",
