            "content": " Explanation: The first statement establishes a conditional relationship between the material of the shirt and the material of the pants. It states that if the shirt is made of cotton, then the pants must be made of denim. However, it does not provide any information about what happens when the shirt is not made of cotton.\n\nThe second statement introduces a new piece of information - that the pants might not have been denim. This means that there are other possibilities for the material of the pants besides denim.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot infer whether or not the shirt was made of cotton. The first statement only establishes a conditional relationship between the materials of the shirt and pants, but it does not provide any information about what happens when the shirt is not made of cotton. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about the material of the shirt based on the given statements.\n",
