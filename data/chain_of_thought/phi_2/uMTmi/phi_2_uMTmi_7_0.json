However, it does not tell us anything about whether or not Chris actually finished the race. The second statement tells us that Chris might not have finished the race. This means that there is a possibility that Chris did finish the race, but we cannot be certain. Therefore, we cannot infer that Alex did not finish the race based on these two statements alone.\nAnswer: No\n",
