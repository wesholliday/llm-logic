            "content": " Explanation: The first statement implies that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be made of metal. However, it does not state that all dolls are made of plastic or that all trucks are made of metal. Therefore, we cannot make a definite conclusion about whether the doll was plastic based on this information alone.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic. The first statement only establishes a relationship between the material of the doll and the truck, but it does not provide enough evidence to determine the material of the doll. Additionally, the second statement introduces the possibility that the truck could be made of a different material than metal, which would not affect our ability to infer the material of the doll.\n",
