However, the second statement contradicts this by saying that the book might not be a mystery novel. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether or not the book was written by James based on these two statements alone.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the book was not written by James. The first statement only tells us that if the book is written by James, it must be a mystery novel. It does not provide any information about what other genres the book could be. Therefore, even though the second statement contradicts this, we still do not have enough evidence to conclude that the book was not written by James.\n",
