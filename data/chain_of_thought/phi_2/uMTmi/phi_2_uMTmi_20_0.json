            "content": " Explanation: The first statement establishes a conditional relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana. It states that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. However, it does not provide any information about what happens when the apple is not red. The second statement introduces a new possibility - that the banana might not have been yellow. This means that there could still be a scenario where the apple is not red and the banana is not yellow. Therefore, we cannot infer that the apple was not red based on these two statements alone.\nAnswer: No\n",
