            "content": " Explanation: The first statement tells us that if Lisa buys the red shirt, then Mark must buy the blue shirt. However, it does not tell us anything about what happens if Lisa does not buy the red shirt. The second statement only tells us that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, but it does not give us any information about whether or not he actually did. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about whether or not Lisa bought the red shirt based on these two statements alone.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. The first statement only tells us what happens if she buys it, but it does not tell us anything about what happens if she doesn't. The second statement is irrelevant to this question and does not provide any information about whether or not Lisa bought the red shirt.\n",
