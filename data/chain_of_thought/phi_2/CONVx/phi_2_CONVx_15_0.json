            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if the dreb was spened, then it must have been vroombed. This is because of the transitive property in logic, which states that if A implies B and B implies C, then A implies C. In this case, 'dreb was vroombed' implies 'dreb was spened', and 'dreb was spened' implies 'dreb was vroombed'. Therefore, we can conclude that 'dreb was vroombed' if it was spened.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
