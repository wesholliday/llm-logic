This is because the statement \"if A, then B\" means that whenever A is true, B must also be true. In this case, A represents the clug being fleeked and B represents the clug being snugged. Therefore, if we know that the clug was fleeked (A), we can conclude that it must have been snugged (B).\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
