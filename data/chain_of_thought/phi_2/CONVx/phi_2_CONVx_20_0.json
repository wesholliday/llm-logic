In this case, 'If the fleeg was bluttered' is equivalent to 'A', 'then it surned' is equivalent to 'B', and 'if the fleeg surned' is equivalent to 'C'. Therefore, we can conclude that if 'A' is true, then 'C' must also be true.\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned because of the transitive property in logic.
