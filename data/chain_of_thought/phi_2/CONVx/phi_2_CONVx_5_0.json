This is because the statement \"if A, then B\" means that whenever A happens, B will also happen. In this case, A represents the zinger being fraggled and B represents the zinger being smoogled. Since we know that if the zinger was fraggled (A), it must have been smoogled as well (B), then we can conclude that if the zinger was smoogled (B), it must have also been fraggled (A).\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that if the zinger was smoogled, then it must have been fraggled.
