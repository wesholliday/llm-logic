This is because the statement 'if A, then B' means that whenever A happens, B will always happen as well. In this case, A represents the fribble being snuggled and B represents the fribble being crinkled. Therefore, if we know that the fribble was snuggled (A), we can conclude that it must also be crinkled (B).\n",
