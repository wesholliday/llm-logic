This is because the statement \"if A, then B\" means that whenever A is true, B must also be true. In this case, A represents the zinger being fraggled and B represents the zinger being smoogled. If we know that A is false (the zinger was not fraggled), then according to the statement, B must also be false (the zinger was not smoogled).\n",
