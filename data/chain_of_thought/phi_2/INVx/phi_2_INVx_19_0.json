If the smonk was vreebled, it means that it was plagged, and if it was not vreebled, it does not necessarily mean that it was not plagged. However, if it was not plagged, then it cannot be considered a smonk. Therefore, we can conclude that if the smonk was not vreebled, then it was not plagged.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
