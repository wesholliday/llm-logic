            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if the dreb was not vroombed, then it was not spened. This is because the statement 'if p then q' and its contrapositive 'if not q then not p' are logically equivalent. In this case, p represents \"the dreb was vroombed\" and q represents \"the dreb was spened\". Therefore, if we know that the dreb was not vroombed (not p), then we can conclude that it was not spened (not q).\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
