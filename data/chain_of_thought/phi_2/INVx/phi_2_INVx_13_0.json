This is because the statement 'if the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged' implies a cause and effect relationship between the two actions. If one action (slogging) occurs, then the other action (tagging) must also occur. Therefore, if the first action does not occur, we can conclude that the second action did not occur as well.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
