            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked' implies that if the splat was not morphed, it would not have quanked. This is because the word 'if' indicates a conditional relationship between two events - in this case, morphing and quanking. If one event does not occur, then the other cannot occur as well. Therefore, we can infer that if the splat was not morphed, it did not quank.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
