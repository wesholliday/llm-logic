This is because the statement \"if the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\" implies a cause and effect relationship between shanking the whiffle and it tinkling. If the first part of the statement (shanking) does not occur, then we can conclude that the second part (tinkling) did not happen either.\n",
