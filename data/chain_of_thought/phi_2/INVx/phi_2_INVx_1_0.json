            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if the flugel was not blimmed, then it was also not zargled. This is because the statement \"if the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled\" implies a cause and effect relationship between the two actions. If one action (blimming) does not occur, then the other action (zargling) cannot also occur. Therefore, if the flugel was not blimmed, it must have been zargled as well.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
