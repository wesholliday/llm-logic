This is because the statement \"if the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" implies a cause and effect relationship between the two actions. If one action (bluttering) occurs, then the other action (surning) must also occur. Therefore, if the first action does not occur, we can conclude that the second action did not occur as well.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
