            "content": " Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement in which the antecedent (if the shirt was cotton) implies the consequent (then the pants were denim). This means that if the shirt was indeed made of cotton, then it must be true that the pants were also made of denim. However, this does not necessarily mean that the opposite is true - just because the pants are made of denim, it does not automatically follow that the shirt was also made of cotton. Therefore, we cannot infer that the shirt was cotton based on the given information alone.\nAnswer: No\n",
