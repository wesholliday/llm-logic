If one event occurs, it implies that the other event also occurred. In this case, if the bear is present in the cave, then the wolf must be in the den. However, we cannot infer anything about the presence or absence of the bear based on the given information alone. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether the bear was in the cave or not.\nAnswer: No\n",
