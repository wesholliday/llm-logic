            "content": " Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional statement, where if the antecedent (the first part) is true, then the consequent (the second part) must also be true. In this case, the antecedent is 'If the apple was red', and the consequent is 'then the banana was yellow'. However, we cannot infer anything about the color of the apple from these statements as they only provide information about the relationship between the colors of the apple and banana.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the apple was red based on the given statements. The conditional statement only tells us that if the apple were red, then the banana would be yellow. It does not give any information about the color of the apple itself. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about the color of the apple from these statements.\n",
