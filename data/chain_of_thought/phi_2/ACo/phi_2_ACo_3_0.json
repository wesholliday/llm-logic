            "content": " Explanation: The given statement is in the form of a conditional statement, where if the antecedent (the first part) is true, then the consequent (the second part) must also be true. In this case, the antecedent is 'The book is a mystery novel' and the consequent is 'If the book was written by James'. Since we are given that the book is indeed a mystery novel, it follows logically that if the book was written by James, then it would still be considered a mystery novel. Therefore, we can infer that the book was written by James.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
