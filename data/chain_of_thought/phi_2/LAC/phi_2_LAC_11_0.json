            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can logically infer that the cake was chocolate based on the given statements. This is because if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would have to be blueberry according to the first statement. However, since it is stated in the second statement that the muffins were indeed blueberry, this means that the cake cannot be chocolate as it contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we can conclude that the cake must have been a different flavor than chocolate.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
