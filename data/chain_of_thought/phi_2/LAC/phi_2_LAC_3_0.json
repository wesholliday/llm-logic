            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can logically infer that the book was written by James. This is because if the first statement is true and the second statement is also true, then it follows that the third statement must be true as well. In other words, if the book is a mystery novel (which it is), and if the first statement is true (meaning that if the book was written by James, then it would be a mystery novel), then we can conclude that the book was indeed written by James.\nAnswer: Yes, we can logically infer that the book was written by James. This is because if both statements are true, then the third statement must also be true. In this case, since the first statement says that if the book was written by James, it would be a mystery novel and the second statement confirms that the book is indeed a mystery novel, we can conclude that the book was written by James.\n",
