            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can logically infer that the shirt was made of cotton based on the given statements. This is because if the shirt was made of cotton (which is a type of fabric), then it would be true that the pants were also made of denim (since denim is a common material used for jeans). Therefore, since we know that the pants were indeed made of denim, we can conclude that the shirt must have been made of cotton.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
