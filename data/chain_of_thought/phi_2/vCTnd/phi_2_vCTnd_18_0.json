If the premise 'If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth' is true, then the conclusion 'If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed' must also be true. However, this does not necessarily mean that the argument is logically valid because there could be other factors at play that affect whether or not an issue is discussed in depth.\n",
