            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of modus tollens, which is a valid logical form. Modus tollens states that if the antecedent (if A, then B) and the consequent (not B) are both true, then the conclusion (not A) must also be true. In this case, the premise 'If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal' is the antecedent and the conclusion 'If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal' is the consequent. Since both the antecedent and the consequent are true (you did eat a meal and you did not eat a large meal), we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
