The argument's conclusion is that if Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise. \nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid because it follows the rule of modus tollens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and its consequent is false, then its antecedent must also be false. In this case, since Ann exercised strenuously (the consequent is false), we can conclude that she did not exercise (the antecedent must also be false).\n",
