If the antecedent (if instructions were given) is true, then the consequent (they were not explained clearly) must also be true. However, if the consequent (they were explained clearly) is false, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (if instructions were given) is false. Therefore, this argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
