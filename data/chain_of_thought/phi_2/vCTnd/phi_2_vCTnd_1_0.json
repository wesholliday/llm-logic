The argument states that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true. However, this does not necessarily mean that the converse of the statement (if it'isn't raining hard, then it'isn't raining) is also true. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the argument is logically valid based on its premises alone.\nAnswer: No\n",
