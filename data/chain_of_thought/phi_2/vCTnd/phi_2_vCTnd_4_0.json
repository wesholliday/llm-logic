The argument's premise states that if Ben studied, then he did not study diligently. However, it does not provide any information about whether or not Ben actually studied. Therefore, we cannot determine whether or not Ben studied diligently based on this premise alone.\n\nAnswer: No, the form of argument is not logically valid because the premise does not provide enough information to support the conclusion.\n",
