The argument is also in the form of denying the consequent, which means that if the consequent is false, then the antecedent must be true.\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid because it follows the rules of conditional statements and denying the consequent. If the room was cleaned thoroughly (consequent is false), then according to the premise, it cannot have been cleaned (antecedent must be true). Therefore, if the room was not cleaned thoroughly, then it must have been cleaned (antecedent is true).\n",
