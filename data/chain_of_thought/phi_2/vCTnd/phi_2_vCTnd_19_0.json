If the antecedent (if directions were provided) is true, then the consequent (they were not explained clearly) must also be true. However, if the consequent (they were explained clearly) is false, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (directions were provided) is false. Therefore, this argument is logically valid.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
