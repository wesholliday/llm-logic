Modus tollens states that if the antecedent (the first premise) is true, then the consequent (the second premise) must also be true. In this case, the antecedent is \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel,\" and the consequent is \"The book might not be a mystery novel.\" Since the consequent is false, we can conclude that the antecedent must also be false, which means that the book was not written by James.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
