            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of a conditional statement, where the first premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. The second premise introduces the possibility that Jen might not have watched basketball. However, we cannot conclude from these premises that Tom did not watch football because there could be other reasons why Jen did not watch basketball.
