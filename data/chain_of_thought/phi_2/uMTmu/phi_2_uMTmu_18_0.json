            "content": " Explanation: The first statement establishes a conditional relationship between the material of the doll and the material of the truck. It states that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. However, it does not provide any information about what happens when the doll is not plastic. The second statement contradicts the first by stating that the truck can be made of any material other than metal. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the material of the doll based on these two statements alone.\nAnswer: No\n",
