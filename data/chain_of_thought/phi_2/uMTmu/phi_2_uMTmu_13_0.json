            "content": " Explanation: The first statement establishes a conditional relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck. It states that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. However, it does not provide any information about what happens when the car is not red. The second statement tells us that the truck cannot be blue. Therefore, we can infer that the car was not red because there are no other possibilities for its color.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
