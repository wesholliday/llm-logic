            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can logically deduce that the shirt was made of cotton based on the given statements. This is because if the shirt was made of cotton (which it wasn't), then the pants would have been made of a different material (since they were denim). However, since we know that the pants were indeed made of denim, this means that the shirt must have been made of cotton in order for both statements to be true.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
