            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" can be represented as a conditional statement with the hypothesis being \"the vampire was awake\" and the conclusion being \"the mummy was awake.\" In this case, we are given that both the hypothesis and the conclusion are true. Therefore, it is possible for the vampire to have been awake while the mummy was also awake. However, there could be other reasons why the mummy was awake besides the vampire being awake. For example, the mummy could have woken up on its own or someone else could have woken it up. So, we cannot definitively say that the vampire was awake based solely on the fact that the mummy was awake.\nAnswer: No, it does not necessarily follow that the vampire was awake. While both statements are true, there could be other reasons why the mummy was awake besides the vampire being awake. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the vampire was also awake.\n",
