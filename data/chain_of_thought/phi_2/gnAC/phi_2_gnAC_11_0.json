However, this does not necessarily mean that the opposite is true - just because the muffins were blueberry, it doesn't automatically follow that the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: No, it does not necessarily follow that the cake was chocolate. The given statements only establish a relationship between the cake and the muffins, but do not provide enough information to determine if the opposite is true. It is possible for the cake to be a different flavor than chocolate, even though the muffins were blueberry.\n",
