            "content": " Explanation: The given statement can be represented as a conditional statement in propositional logic. Let p represent \"the doll was plastic\" and q represent \"the truck was metal.\" Then the given statement can be written as p \u2192 q, which means if p is true, then q must also be true.\n\nNow, we are given that both p and q are true. This satisfies the condition of the conditional statement, so it follows that p \u2192 q is true. However, this does not necessarily mean that p is true. It could still be possible for the doll to be plastic even if the truck was metal. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the doll was plastic based on the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: No\n",
