            "content": " Explanation: In this scenario, we are given two statements - 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' and 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. From these two statements, we can infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark would not have bought the blue shirt. However, since we know that Mark did in fact buy the blue shirt, it is possible that Lisa could have also bought the red shirt. Therefore, it does not necessarily follow that Lisa bought the red shirt.\nAnswer: No\n",
