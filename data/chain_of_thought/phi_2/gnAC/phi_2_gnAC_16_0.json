            "content": " Explanation: The given statement can be represented as a conditional statement in propositional logic. Let p represent \"the shirt was cotton\" and q represent \"the pants were denim.\" Then the given statement can be written as p \u2192 q, which means if p is true, then q must also be true.\n\nNow, we are given that both p and q are true. This satisfies the condition of the conditional statement, so it must be true. However, this does not necessarily mean that p is true. It could still be possible for the shirt to be made of a different material, such as polyester or silk. Therefore, it cannot be concluded with certainty that the shirt was cotton based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No, it does not necessarily follow that the shirt was cotton.\n",
