            "content": " Explanation: Yes, if both statements are true, then it follows logically that Mary must have been at the wedding. This is because the first statement establishes a conditional relationship between Mary and Sue being at the wedding, meaning that if one of them was there, the other must also be there. Since we know that Sue was indeed at the wedding (the second statement), it can be inferred that Mary must have also been there to fulfill the condition set in the first statement.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
