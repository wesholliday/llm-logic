            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' can be represented as a conditional statement in logic. In this case, the antecedent (the first part of the statement) is 'the apple was red', and the consequent (the second part of the statement) is 'the banana was yellow'. The truth value of the entire statement depends on whether or not the antecedent is true. If it is true, then the whole statement must also be true. However, if the antecedent is false, then the truth value of the entire statement does not matter. In this case, we are given that 'the banana was yellow' is true. This means that the consequent (the second part of the conditional statement) is true. Since the consequent is true, it follows that the antecedent must also be true in order for the whole statement to be true. Therefore, it necessarily follows that 'the apple was red' is true.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
