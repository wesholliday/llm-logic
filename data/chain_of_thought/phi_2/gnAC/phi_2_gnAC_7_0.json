We need to determine if it follows logically that 'Alex finished the race' must also be true. \nAnswer: Yes, it necessarily follows that 'Alex finished the race' is true. This can be explained using the concept of logical implication. If we have a conditional statement like 'If A then B', and we know that B is true, then we can conclude that A must also be true. In this case, since we are given that 'Chris finished the race' (B), and the first statement says that if Alex finished the race (A), then Chris would have to finish the race as well, it logically follows that Alex must have finished the race too.\n",
