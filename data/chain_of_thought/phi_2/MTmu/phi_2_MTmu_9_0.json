            "content": " Explanation: The first statement implies a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. If this condition is true, then it follows logically that if Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. However, the second statement contradicts this implication by stating that Mark did not necessarily buy the blue shirt. Therefore, we cannot infer from these two statements whether or not Lisa bought the red shirt.\nAnswer: No\n",
