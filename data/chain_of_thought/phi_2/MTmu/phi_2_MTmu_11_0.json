            "content": " Explanation: The first statement establishes a conditional relationship between the type of cake and the type of muffins. It states that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. However, the second statement negates this condition by stating that it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry. Therefore, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate because the first statement establishes a necessary condition for the muffins to be blueberry, and the second statement denies that condition.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
