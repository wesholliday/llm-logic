            "content": " Explanation: The first statement establishes a conditional relationship between the presence of the bear and the presence of the wolf. If the bear is present, then the wolf must be present as well. However, the second statement negates this condition by stating that it is not true that the wolf was in the den. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the location of the bear based on these two statements alone.\nAnswer: No\n",
