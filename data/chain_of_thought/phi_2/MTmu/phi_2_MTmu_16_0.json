            "content": " Explanation: The first statement establishes a conditional relationship between the material of the shirt and the material of the pants. It states that if the shirt is made of cotton, then the pants must be made of denim. However, the second statement negates this condition by stating that it's not true that the pants must have been denim. Therefore, we can infer that the shirt was not made of cotton because the first statement does not hold true in this case.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
