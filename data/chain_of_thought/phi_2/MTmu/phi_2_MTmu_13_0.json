            "content": " Explanation: The first statement establishes a conditional relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck. It states that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. However, the second statement negates this condition by stating that it's not the case that the truck must have been blue. Therefore, we can infer that the car was not red because the first statement establishes a necessary and sufficient condition for the color of the truck to be blue, but the second statement denies this condition.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
