            "content": " Explanation: The first statement establishes a conditional relationship between the presence of the griffin and the presence of the unicorn. If the griffin is present, then it implies that the unicorn must also be present. However, the second statement negates this implication by stating that the unicorn does not necessarily have to be in the forest. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the location of the griffin based on these two statements alone.\nAnswer: No\n",
