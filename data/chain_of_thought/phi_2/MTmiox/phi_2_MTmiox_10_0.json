In this case, if the wug was sproinged (condition 1), then it must have been garbled (condition 2). However, we cannot infer that the wug was not sproinged just because it was not garbled. It is possible for the wug to be sproinged and still remain ungarbled. Therefore, we cannot make a definite conclusion about whether or not the wug was sproinged based on the given statements.\nAnswer: No\n",
