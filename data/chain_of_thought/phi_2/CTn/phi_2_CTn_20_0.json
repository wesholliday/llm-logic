            "content": " Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement in which the antecedent (if the apple was red) implies the consequent (then the banana was not yellow). This means that if the first part of the statement is true, then the second part must also be true. However, this does not necessarily mean that the reverse is true - just because the banana was not yellow does not automatically imply that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red' from the given statement. The two statements are not logically equivalent and do not have a direct relationship with each other.\n",
