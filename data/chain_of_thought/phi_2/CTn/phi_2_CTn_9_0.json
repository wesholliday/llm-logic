            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of a conditional statement in logic. The first part of the statement, \"if Lisa bought the red shirt\", is called the antecedent and the second part, \"then Mark did not buy the blue shirt\", is called the consequent. In this case, we are given that the antecedent is true (Lisa bought the red shirt), so we can use modus tollens to infer that the consequent must also be true (Mark did not buy the blue shirt). Therefore, if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
