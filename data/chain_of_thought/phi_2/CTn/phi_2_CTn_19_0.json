            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football based on the given statement. This is because of the contrapositive rule in logic, which states that if a conditional statement \"if A then B\" is true, then its contrapositive \"if not B then not A\" is also true. In this case, the original statement can be rewritten as \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen watched basketball\". Therefore, if we know that Jen did not watch basketball, it follows logically that Tom did not watch football.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
