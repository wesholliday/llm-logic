            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave. This is because of the transitive property of implication, which states that if A implies B and B implies C, then A implies C. In this case, A represents 'the bear was in the cave', B represents 'the wolf was not in the den', and C represents 'the wolf was in the den'. Since we know that A implies B (if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den) and B implies C (if the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave), we can conclude that A implies C (if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den). Therefore, if the wolf was in the den, it must be true that the bear was not in the cave.\n",
