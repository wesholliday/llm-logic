            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate. This is because of the contrapositive rule in logic, which states that if a statement and its negation are both true, then the original statement must also be true. In this case, the original statement is \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\", and its negation is \"The cake was chocolate but the muffins were blueberry\". Since we know that the muffins were indeed blueberry, which means they were not chocolate according to the original statement, we can conclude that the cake must have been a different flavor.\n",
