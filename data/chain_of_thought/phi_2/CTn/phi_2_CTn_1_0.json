            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding. This is because of the contrapositive rule in logic, which states that if a conditional statement (if-then) is true, then its contrapositive (if-not) is also true. In this case, the original statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\" can be rewritten as \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\". Since we know that the contrapositive of a true statement is also true, we can conclude that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\n",
