            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane based on the given statement. This is because of the logical principle of contrapositive, which states that if A implies B, then the negation of B implies the negation of A. In this case, A represents \"Sam took a plane\" and B represents \"Erin took a train\". Therefore, if Erin did not take a train (negation of B), it can be inferred that Sam did not take a plane (negation of A).\n",
