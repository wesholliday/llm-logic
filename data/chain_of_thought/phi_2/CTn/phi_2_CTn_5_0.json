            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball based on the given statement. This is because of the logical principle of contrapositive, which states that if a conditional statement (if-then) is true, its contrapositive (if and only if) is also true. In this case, the original statement can be rewritten as \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff played basketball.\" The contrapositive of this statement would be \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\" Since we know that the original statement is true (Jeff playing basketball implies Amy not playing tennis), we can conclude that the contrapositive must also be true. Therefore, if Amy played tennis, it means that Jeff did not play basketball.\n",
