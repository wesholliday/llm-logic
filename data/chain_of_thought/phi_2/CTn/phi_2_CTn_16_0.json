This is because of the logical principle of contraposition, which states that if a conditional statement is true, its converse (swapped subject and predicate) is also true. In this case, the original statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim\" can be rewritten as \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\" This shows that the two statements are logically equivalent, meaning they have the same truth value. Therefore, if we know one of them is true, we can infer the other must also be true.\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that if the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton based on the given statement.
