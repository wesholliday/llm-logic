            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was not metal. This is because of the contrapositive rule in logic, which states that if a statement is true, its negated form will also be true. In this case, the original statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was not metal\" can be rewritten as \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic\". Therefore, we can infer that if the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
