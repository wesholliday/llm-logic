            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest. This is because of the contrapositive statement given, which states that if one condition (griffin in the forest) is true, then its opposite (unicorn not in the forest) must also be true. Therefore, if we know that the unicorn is in the forest, it logically follows that the griffin cannot be there as well.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
