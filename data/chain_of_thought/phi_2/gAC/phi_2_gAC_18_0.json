            "content": " Explanation: The given statement can be represented as a conditional statement in propositional logic. Let p represent \"the doll was plastic\" and q represent \"the truck was metal.\" Then the given statement can be written as p \u2192 q, which means if p is true then q must also be true. In this case, we are told that both p and q are true, so the conditional statement holds.\nAnswer: Yes, it follows that the doll was plastic. Since p \u2192 q is a valid conditional statement and both p and q are true, it logically follows that if the truck was metal (q), then the doll must have been plastic (p). Therefore, we can conclude that the doll was indeed made of plastic.\n",
