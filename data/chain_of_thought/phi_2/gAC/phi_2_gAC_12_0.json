            "content": " Explanation: In this scenario, we are given two statements - 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' and 'Lucy went to the zoo'. We need to determine if it follows that 'Joe went to the park' is also true. \nAnswer: Yes, it does follow that 'Joe went to the park' is true based on the given statements. This can be explained using the concept of logical implication. If we assume that both statements are true, then by the first statement, if Joe did not go to the park, Lucy would not have gone to the zoo. However, since we know that Lucy did go to the zoo (second statement), it means that Joe must have also gone to the park in order for her to visit the zoo. Therefore, based on these two statements, it is logically valid to conclude that 'Joe went to the park' is true.\n",
