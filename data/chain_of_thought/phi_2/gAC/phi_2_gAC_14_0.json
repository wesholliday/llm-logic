            "content": " Explanation: The statement 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den' can be represented as a conditional statement with the antecedent being 'the bear was in the cave' and the consequent being 'the wolf was in the den'. In this case, both the antecedent and consequent are true. Therefore, according to the rules of logical implication, if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true. This means that it does follow that the bear was in the cave.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
