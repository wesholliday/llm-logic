            "content": " Explanation: If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. This means that if we know that Amy played tennis, we can conclude that Jeff must have also played basketball. However, the statement only tells us that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy would play tennis. It does not say anything about what happens if Jeff did not play basketball.
