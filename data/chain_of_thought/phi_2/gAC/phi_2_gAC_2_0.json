            "content": " Explanation: The statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" implies a conditional relationship between the two animals. This means that if one animal is present in the forest, then the other must also be present. In this case, we know that the unicorn is in the forest, so it follows that the griffin must also be in the forest to satisfy the condition of the statement.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
