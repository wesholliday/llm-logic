            "content": " Explanation: In this scenario, we are given two statements - \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" and \"Mark bought the blue shirt\". From these two statements, we cannot logically conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt. This is because there could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt, such as it being his favorite color or he simply liked the design of the shirt. Therefore, we cannot make a definite conclusion about whether Lisa bought the red shirt based on the given information.\nAnswer: No\n",
