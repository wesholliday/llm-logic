            "content": " Explanation: In this scenario, we are given two statements - 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' and 'The banana was yellow'. The first statement establishes a conditional relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana. It states that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow. The second statement confirms that the banana is indeed yellow. Therefore, we can logically conclude that the apple must have been red since it satisfies the condition set forth in the first statement.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
