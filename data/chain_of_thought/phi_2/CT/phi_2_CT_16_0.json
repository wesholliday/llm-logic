            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton based on the given statement. This is because of the logical principle of contraposition, which states that if a conditional statement is true, its contrapositive (the negated and reversed form) is also true. In this case, the original statement can be rewritten as \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton.\" The contrapositive of this statement would be \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\" Therefore, if we know that the pants were not denim, we can conclude that the shirt was not cotton.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
