            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park. This is because of the logical principle of contraposition, which states that if a conditional statement (if-then) is true, its contrapositive (if-not) is also true. In this case, the original statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" can be rewritten as \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\". This means that if we know for sure that Lucy did not go to the zoo, then we can conclude that Joe also did not go to the park.\n",
