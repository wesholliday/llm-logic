            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red based on the given statement. This is because the statement follows a logical structure of \"if A, then B\", and its contrapositive form is \"if not B, then not A\". In this case, A represents the color of the apple being red, and B represents the color of the banana being yellow. Therefore, if we know that the banana was not yellow (not B), we can conclude that the apple was not red (not A).\nAnswer: Yes\n",
