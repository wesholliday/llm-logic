            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic based on the given statement. This is because of the transitive property in logic, which states that if A implies B and B implies C, then A implies C. In this case, 'plastic' implies 'metal', and 'metal' implies 'not plastic'. Therefore, if the truck was not metal, it must mean that the doll was not plastic.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
