            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave. This is because of the transitive property of implication, which states that if A implies B and B implies C, then A implies C. In this case, A represents the bear being in the cave, B represents the wolf being in the den, and C represents the wolf being in the den. Since we know that if the bear was in the cave (A), then the wolf was in the den (B) is true, and we also know that if the wolf was not in the den (not B), then the bear was not in the cave (not A) is true, we can conclude that if the wolf was not in the den (not B), then the bear was not in the cave (not A).\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
