            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football based on the given statement. This is because of the logical principle of contraposition, which states that if a conditional statement (if-then) is true, its contrapositive (if not A then not B) is also true. In this case, the original statement can be rewritten as \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball\". Therefore, if we know that Jen did not watch basketball, it follows logically that Tom did not watch football.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
