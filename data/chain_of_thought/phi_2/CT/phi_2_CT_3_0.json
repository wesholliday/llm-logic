However, this does not mean that the inverse statement 'If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James' is necessarily true. It is possible for the antecedent to be false and the consequent to still be true. For example, if the book is a romance novel, it could have been written by James even though it is not a mystery novel. Therefore, we cannot infer that the inverse statement is true based on the given information.\nAnswer: No\n",
