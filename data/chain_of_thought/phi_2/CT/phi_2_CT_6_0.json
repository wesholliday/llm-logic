            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza based on the given statement. This is because of the logical principle of contrapositive, which states that if a conditional statement (if-then) is true, then its contrapositive (if not A, then not B) is also true. In this case, the original statement can be rewritten as \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\" Therefore, if we know that Bob did not choose pasta, it follows logically that Sue did not choose pizza.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
