            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate. This is because of the logical rule of contraposition, which states that if a statement is true, its negation is also true. In this case, the original statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" can be rewritten as \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\". This means that if we know for sure that the muffins were not blueberry, then we can conclude that the cake must have been a different flavor.\n",
