            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball based on the given statement. This is because of the logical principle of contrapositive, which states that if a conditional statement (if-then) is true, then its contrapositive (if not A then not B) is also true. In this case, the original statement can be rewritten as \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis\". Therefore, if we know that Amy did not play tennis, it follows logically that Jeff did not play basketball.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
