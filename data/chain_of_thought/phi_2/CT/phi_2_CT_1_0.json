            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was also not at the wedding. This is because of the logical principle of contrapositive, which states that if a conditional statement (if-then) is true, then its contrapositive (if not-then) is also true. In this case, the original statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" can be rewritten as \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\". This means that if we know for sure that Sue was not at the wedding, then we can conclude that Mary was also not at the wedding.\n",
