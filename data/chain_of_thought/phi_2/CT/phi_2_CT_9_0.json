            "content": " Explanation: This is an example of a conditional statement in logic, where one statement (the antecedent) implies another statement (the consequent). In this case, if Lisa bought the red shirt, it means that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. However, if we know that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then we cannot infer anything about whether or not Lisa bought the red shirt. This is because there could be other reasons why Mark did not buy the blue shirt, such as he already had one or he changed his mind. Therefore, we cannot make a definite conclusion based on this information alone.\nAnswer: No\n",
