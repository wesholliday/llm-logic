            "content": " Explanation: The first statement establishes a conditional relationship between the sprocket being cranked and it being daggled. The second statement negates the consequent of this conditional, which means that if the consequent is false (i.e., the sprocket was not daggled), then the antecedent must also be false (i.e., the sprocket was not cranked). Therefore, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
