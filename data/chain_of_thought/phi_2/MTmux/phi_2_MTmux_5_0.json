            "content": " Explanation: The first statement is a conditional statement in which the antecedent is 'the zinger was fraggled' and the consequent is 'then the zinger must have been smoogled'. The second statement negates the consequent of the first statement, making it 'It's not the case that the zinger must have been smoogled'.
