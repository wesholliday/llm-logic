            "content": " Explanation: The first statement is a conditional statement, which means if one thing happens, then another thing will happen. In this case, it says that if the flug was blummed (which means it was zimmed), then the flug must have been zimmed. The second statement negates the condition in the first statement, saying that it is not true that the flug must have been zimmed. Therefore, we can infer that the flug was not blummed because if it were, then the second statement would be false.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
