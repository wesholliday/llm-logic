However, the second statement says that the fleeg did not have a surname. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether or not the fleeg was bluttered based on these two statements alone. \nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the fleeg was not bluttered. The first statement only tells us about the relationship between having a surname and being bluttered, but it does not provide any information about the opposite relationship. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about whether or not the fleeg was bluttered based on these two statements alone.\n",
