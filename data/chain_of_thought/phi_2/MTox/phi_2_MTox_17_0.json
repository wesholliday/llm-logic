Therefore, we cannot conclude whether or not the flob was skizzled based on these two statements alone. \nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the flob was not skizzled. The first statement only tells us what will happen if the flob is skizzled, but it does not tell us anything about what will happen if it is not skizzled. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about whether or not the flob was skizzled based on these two statements alone.\n",
