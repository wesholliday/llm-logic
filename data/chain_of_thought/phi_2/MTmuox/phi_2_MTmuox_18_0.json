This means that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true. However, in this case, we are given the negation of the antecedent, which is 'It's not the case that the shank must have been nugged'. Therefore, we can infer that the antecedent is false and hence, the consequent cannot be determined.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the shank was not plooked based on the given statement. The negation of the antecedent does not provide enough information to determine the truth value of the consequent. \n",
