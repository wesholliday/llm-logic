This means that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must be false. The second statement is another conditional statement in which the antecedent is 'the sneg was crampled' and the consequent is 'the sneg must have sproted the frink'. This means that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true. Therefore, we can infer that if the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
