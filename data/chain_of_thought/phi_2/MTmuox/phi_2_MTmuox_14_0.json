In this case, if the clug was snugged together with the clog, then it must have been fleeked. However, we cannot infer that the clug was not fleeked just because it wasn't snugged together with the clog. There could be other reasons why the clug was not snugged together.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the clug was not fleeked based on the given statements. The fact that the clug was not snugged together with the clog does not necessarily mean it wasn't fleeked. \n",
