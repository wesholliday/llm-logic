In this case, if the glip was slogged (A), then it must have tragged (B). However, we cannot infer that the glip was not slogged just because it did not trag (not B) from these two statements alone. There could be other reasons why the glip did not trag, such as being too tired or injured to do so.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the glip was not slogged based on the given statements.\n",
