This means that if the dreb was spened, it is possible for it to not be the case that the dreb must have been spened. However, we cannot infer anything about whether or not the dreb was vroombed based on these statements alone.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the dreb was not vroombed from the given statements. The first statement only tells us that if the dreb was spened, it is possible for it to not be the case that the dreb must have been spened. It does not provide any information about whether or not the dreb was vroombed.\n",
