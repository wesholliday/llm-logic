In this case, if the flugel was zargled (A), then it must have been blimmed (B). However, we cannot infer that the flugel was not blimmed just because it wasn't zargled. It's possible for the flugel to be blimmed without being zargled. Therefore, we cannot make a definite conclusion about whether or not the flugel was blimmed based on the given statements.\nAnswer: No.\n",
