This is because of the logical principle of contrapositive, which states that if a statement and its negation are both true, then their contrapositive must also be true. In this case, the original statement \"If the job was completed, then it was not completed well\" can be rewritten as \"If the job was completed poorly, then it was not completed\". The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the job was completed well, then it was not completed poorly\", which is what we are trying to infer.\n",
