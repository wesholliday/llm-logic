            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if the customer was served promptly, then he was not served. This is because of the contrapositive rule in logic, which states that if a statement and its negation are both true, then their contrapositives must also be true. In this case, the original statement \"If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly\" can be rewritten as \"If the customer was not served promptly, then he was not served.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served,\" which matches the second question. Therefore, we can infer that if the customer was served promptly, then he was not served.\nAnswer: Yes\n",
