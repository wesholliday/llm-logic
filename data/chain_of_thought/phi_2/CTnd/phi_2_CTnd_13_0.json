            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise. This is because of the contrapositive rule in logic, which states that if a statement and its negation are both true, then their contrapositives must also be true. In this case, the original statement \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much\" can be rewritten as \"If Alex did not exercise much, then he did not exercise.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise,\" which means that if Alex exercised much, it must mean that he did not exercise at all. Therefore, we can infer that if Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
