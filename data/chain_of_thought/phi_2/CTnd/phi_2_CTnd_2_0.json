This is because the statement 'If A, then B' and its contrapositive 'If not B, then not A' are logically equivalent. In this case, A represents \"Ann exercised\" and B represents \"she exercised strenuously\". So, if we know that Ann did not exercise strenuously (not B), then we can conclude that she did not exercise at all (not A).\n",
