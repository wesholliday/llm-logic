It states that if it is raining, then it is not raining hard. This can be represented as p \u2192 \u00acq, where p represents 'it' is raining and q represents 'it' is raining hard.\nNow, to infer the statement 'If it's raining hard, then it'is not raining', we need to use the contrapositive of the given statement which is \u00acq \u2192 \u00acp. This means that if it is not raining hard, then it is not raining. Therefore, we can conclude that if it's raining hard, then it is not raining.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
