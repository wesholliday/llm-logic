            "content": " Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement that states if one condition (the room being tidied) is met, then another condition (the room being tidied thoroughly) must also be met. This can be represented as \"If P, then Q\", where P represents the first condition and Q represents the second condition.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that if the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied. This is because the given statement follows the logical rule of contrapositive, which states that if a conditional statement is true, its contrapositive (the negation of both conditions) must also be true. In this case, the contrapositive would be \"If Q, then not P\", meaning that if the room was tidied thoroughly, it cannot have been tidied only partially or not at all.\n",
