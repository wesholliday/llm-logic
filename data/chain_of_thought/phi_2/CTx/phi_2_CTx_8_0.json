            "content": " Explanation: Yes, we can infer that if the sprocket was not daggled, then it was not cranked. This is because the statement \"if the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" implies a cause and effect relationship between the two actions. If one action (cranking) occurs, then the other action (daggling) must also occur. Therefore, if the second action does not occur, it can be inferred that the first action did not occur as well.\nAnswer: Yes.\n",
