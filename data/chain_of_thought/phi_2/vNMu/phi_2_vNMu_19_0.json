The conclusion then follows from this premise by stating that there is a possibility that the watch might not be charging on the dresser. \nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid. If the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true because it follows directly from the premise. In other words, if it is not the case that the watch is charging on the dresser, then there is a possibility that it might not be charging on the dresser.\n",
