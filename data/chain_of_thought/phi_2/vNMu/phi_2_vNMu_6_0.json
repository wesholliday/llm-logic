In order for a conditional statement to be logically valid, the antecedent must be false or the consequent must be true. \nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid because if the premise is true (i.e., it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza), then the conclusion necessarily follows as well (Sue might not have chosen pizza).\n",
