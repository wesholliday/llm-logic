            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of a conditional statement, where the antecedent (the \"it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\") and the consequent (the \"the griffin might not have been in the forest\") are connected by the word 'might'. In order for this type of argument to be logically valid, it must follow the rule of modus tollens. This means that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true. However, since we do not know whether or not the griffin was in the forest, we cannot determine the truth value of the conclusion. Therefore, this argument is logically invalid.\nAnswer: No\n",
