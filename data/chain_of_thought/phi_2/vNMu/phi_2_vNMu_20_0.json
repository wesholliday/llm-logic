In order for a conditional statement to be logically valid, it must follow the rule of modus tollens. This means that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true. However, this argument does not provide enough information about whether or not the sunglasses are actually in her bag, so we cannot determine its logical validity based on the given premises and conclusion alone.\n",
