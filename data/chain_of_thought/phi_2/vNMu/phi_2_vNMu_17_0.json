The form of this argument is valid because it follows the logical structure of a conditional statement, where if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true.\nAnswer: Yes. This argument is logically valid because it follows the structure of a conditional statement, where if the antecedent is true (the scarf does not have to be stuffed in my backpack), then the consequent (the scarf might not be stuffed in my backpack) must also be true.\n",
