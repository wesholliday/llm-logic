In other words, if it's not necessary for the shoes to be in the closet, then they might not actually be there. \nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows from the premise. If the premise is true (i.e., the shoes do not have to be in the closet), then the conclusion must also be true (i.e., the shoes might not be in the closet).\n",
