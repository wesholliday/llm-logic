In order for this type of argument to be logically valid, it must follow the rule of modus tollens. This means that if the antecedent is true and the consequent is false, then the conclusion must also be true.\nAnswer: Yes. The argument follows the rule of modus tollens, making it a logically valid form of reasoning.\n",
