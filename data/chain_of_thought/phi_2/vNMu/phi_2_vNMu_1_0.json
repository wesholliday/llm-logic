            "content": " Explanation: This argument is an example of a conditional statement, where the premise states that it's not the case that Mary was present at the wedding. The conclusion then follows from this premise by suggesting that there is a possibility that Mary might not have been at the wedding. \nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid because if the premise is true (Mary wasn't at the wedding), then it logically follows that she could have been somewhere else or not present at all. The conclusion does not make any assumptions about whether Mary was actually at the wedding or not, but rather presents a possibility based on the given premise.\n",
