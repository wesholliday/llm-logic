            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table\" is a logical disjunction. In logic, a disjunction is true if at least one of the components is true. This means that for the disjunction to be true, either \"the book is on the shelf\" must be true, or \"the book is resting on the table\" must be true, or both.\n\nThe second statement, \"The book isn't resting on the table,\" negates one of the possibilities in the disjunction. If \"the book isn't resting on the table\" is true, then the second part of the disjunction is false. \n\nSince the disjunction \"Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table\" must be true, and we have established that \"the book isn't resting on the table,\" the only remaining possibility for the disjunction to hold true is that \"the book is on the shelf.\"\n\nTherefore, given the information provided, we can logically infer that \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
