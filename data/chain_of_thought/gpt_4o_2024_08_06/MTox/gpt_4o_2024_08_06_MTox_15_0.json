            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The dreb was not vroombed' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'The dreb was not spened'. This is a straightforward statement indicating that the action of 'spening' did not occur to the 'dreb'.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened'. In logical terms, this can be expressed as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the dreb was vroombed' and Q is 'the dreb was spened'.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is false only when P is true and Q is false. In all other cases (P false, Q true, or both P and Q false), the conditional statement is considered true.\n\nNow, let's apply this to our situation:\n\n- We know from the first statement that 'The dreb was not spened' (Q is false).\n- For the conditional 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened' to hold true, given that Q is false, P must also be false. This is because if P were true (the dreb was vroombed), then Q would have to be true for the conditional to be true, which contradicts our known fact that Q is false.\n\nTherefore, the only way the conditional statement can be true, given that 'the dreb was not spened', is if 'the dreb was not vroombed' (P is false).\n\nAnswer: yes",
