            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The sneg was not crampled' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'The sneg did not sproted the frink'. This is a straightforward statement indicating that the action of 'sproting the frink' did not occur with respect to 'the sneg'.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink'. In logical terms, this can be expressed as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the sneg was crampled' and Q is 'the sneg sproted the frink'.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is false only when P is true and Q is false. In all other cases (P false, Q true, or both P and Q false), the conditional statement is true.\n\nGiven that 'The sneg did not sproted the frink' (Q is false), for the conditional statement 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink' to hold true, P must be false. This is because if P were true (the sneg was crampled), then Q would have to be true for the conditional to be true, which contradicts the given information that Q is false.\n\nTherefore, the only way for the conditional statement to remain true, given that 'the sneg did not sproted the frink', is if 'the sneg was not crampled' (P is false).\n\nAnswer: yes",
