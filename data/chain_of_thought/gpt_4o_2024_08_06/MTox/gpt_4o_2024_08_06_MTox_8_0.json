            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The sprocket was not cranked' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'The sprocket was not daggled.' This is a straightforward statement indicating the condition of the sprocket.\n\n2. The second statement is 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.' This is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the sprocket was cranked' and Q is 'the sprocket was daggled.'\n\nIn logical terms, the conditional statement 'If P, then Q' can be understood as:\n- If P is true, then Q must also be true.\n- If Q is false, then P must also be false (this is the contrapositive and is logically equivalent to the original statement).\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given statements:\n- We know from the first statement that 'The sprocket was not daggled' (Q is false).\n- From the contrapositive of the second statement, if Q is false ('the sprocket was not daggled'), then P must also be false ('the sprocket was not cranked').\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can logically infer that 'The sprocket was not cranked.'\n\nAnswer: yes",
