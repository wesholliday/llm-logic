            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The splat was not morphed' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'The splat did not quank'. This is a straightforward statement indicating that the action of quanking did not occur.\n\n2. The second statement is 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked'. This is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the splat was morphed' and Q is 'the splat quanked'.\n\nIn logical terms, the conditional 'If P, then Q' can be expressed as 'P implies Q'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If not Q, then not P', which is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement.\n\nGiven the first statement 'The splat did not quank', we have 'not Q'. Applying the contrapositive of the second statement, 'If not Q, then not P', we can infer 'not P', which translates to 'The splat was not morphed'.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical analysis of the given statements, we can indeed infer 'The splat was not morphed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
