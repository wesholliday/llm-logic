            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in a form that resembles a logical syllogism. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" This can be symbolized as: \n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"the book was written by James\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the book must be a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\" This is the negation of \\( Q \\), which can be symbolized as:\n   - \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The book was not written by James.\" This is the negation of \\( P \\), which can be symbolized as:\n   - \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nThe argument can be structured as follows:\n- Premise 1: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"modus tollens,\" which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus tollens states that if you have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and you know that \\( Q \\) is false (\\( \\neg Q \\)), then you can conclude that \\( P \\) must also be false (\\( \\neg P \\)).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it correctly applies the modus tollens rule.\n\nAnswer: yes",
