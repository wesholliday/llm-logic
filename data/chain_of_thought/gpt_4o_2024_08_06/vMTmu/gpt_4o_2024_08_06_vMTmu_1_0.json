            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument is structured as follows:\n\n1. Premise 1: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. (This can be symbolized as: M \u2192 S, where M is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S is \"Sue must have been at the wedding.\")\n2. Premise 2: It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. (This can be symbolized as: \u00acS, meaning \"not S.\")\n3. Conclusion: Mary was not at the wedding. (This can be symbolized as: \u00acM, meaning \"not M.\")\n\nThis argument follows a common logical form known as \"modus tollens.\" Modus tollens is a valid form of argument and can be summarized as follows:\n\n- If P, then Q.\n- Not Q.\n- Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, the argument fits the modus tollens form:\n\n- If M, then S. (Premise 1)\n- Not S. (Premise 2)\n- Therefore, not M. (Conclusion)\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens form, it is logically valid. The conclusion \"Mary was not at the wedding\" logically follows from the premises given.\n\nAnswer: yes",
