            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and its negation, which is a classic form of argument known as \"modus tollens.\"\n\nThe structure of the argument is as follows:\n\n1. Premise 1: If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. (This can be symbolized as: If P, then Q)\n2. Premise 2: It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow. (This can be symbolized as: Not Q)\n3. Conclusion: The apple was not red. (This can be symbolized as: Not P)\n\nIn modus tollens, the argument takes the form:\n\n- If P, then Q.\n- Not Q.\n- Therefore, Not P.\n\nThis form of argument is logically valid because if the first premise is true (If P, then Q), and the second premise is true (Not Q), then it logically follows that P cannot be true, otherwise Q would have to be true. Therefore, the conclusion (Not P) must be true if the premises are true.\n\nIn this specific argument:\n\n- The first premise states a conditional relationship between the apple being red and the banana being yellow.\n- The second premise denies the consequent (the banana being yellow).\n- The conclusion denies the antecedent (the apple being red).\n\nSince this follows the modus tollens structure, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
