            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument is structured as follows:\n\n1. Premise 1: If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside. (This can be represented as: D \u2192 C, where D is \"the dog was inside\" and C is \"the cat must have been outside.\")\n2. Premise 2: It's not the case that the cat must have been outside. (This can be represented as: \u00acC, meaning \"not C.\")\n3. Conclusion: The dog was not inside. (This can be represented as: \u00acD, meaning \"not D.\")\n\nThis argument follows the form of a logical rule known as \"modus tollens.\" Modus tollens is a valid form of argument and can be summarized as follows:\n\n- If P implies Q (P \u2192 Q)\n- Not Q (\u00acQ)\n- Therefore, not P (\u00acP)\n\nIn this argument:\n\n- P is \"the dog was inside\" (D)\n- Q is \"the cat must have been outside\" (C)\n\nThe premises are:\n\n- D \u2192 C (If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside)\n- \u00acC (It's not the case that the cat must have been outside)\n\nThe conclusion is \u00acD (The dog was not inside).\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens form, it is logically valid. The conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
