            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in a form that can be evaluated using principles of formal logic, specifically modus tollens.\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. First premise: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This can be symbolized as: \\( G \\rightarrow U \\), where \\( G \\) represents \"the griffin was in the forest\" and \\( U \\) represents \"the unicorn must have been in the forest.\"\n\n2. Second premise: \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This can be symbolized as: \\( \\neg U \\).\n\n3. Conclusion: \"The griffin was not in the forest.\" This can be symbolized as: \\( \\neg G \\).\n\nThe argument can be structured as follows:\n\n- Premise 1: \\( G \\rightarrow U \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg U \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg G \\)\n\nThis structure is a classic example of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Modus tollens states that if you have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and you know that \\( \\neg Q \\) is true, then you can conclude \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nApplying modus tollens to our argument:\n\n- From \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) and \\( \\neg U \\), we can validly conclude \\( \\neg G \\).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it correctly applies the rule of modus tollens.\n\nAnswer: yes",
