            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The argument is structured as follows:\n\n1. Premise 1: If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. (This can be symbolized as: P \u2192 B, where P is \"Sue chose pizza\" and B is \"Bob must have chosen pasta.\")\n2. Premise 2: It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta. (This can be symbolized as: \u00acB, meaning \"not B.\")\n3. Conclusion: Sue did not choose pizza. (This can be symbolized as: \u00acP, meaning \"not P.\")\n\nThis argument follows a common logical form known as \"modus tollens.\" Modus tollens is a valid form of argument and can be summarized as follows:\n\n- If P \u2192 B (if P, then B)\n- \u00acB (not B)\n- Therefore, \u00acP (not P)\n\nIn modus tollens, if the conditional statement \"if P, then B\" is true, and B is false (\u00acB), then P must also be false (\u00acP). This is because if P were true, B would have to be true as well, given the initial conditional statement. Since B is not true, P cannot be true either.\n\nApplying this to the given argument:\n\n- We have the conditional statement: If Sue chose pizza (P), then Bob must have chosen pasta (B).\n- We are given that Bob did not choose pasta (\u00acB).\n- Therefore, it logically follows that Sue did not choose pizza (\u00acP).\n\nSince the argument follows the valid form of modus tollens, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
