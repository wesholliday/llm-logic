            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in a form that resembles a common logical structure known as \"modus tollens.\" \n\nThe premises and conclusion are as follows:\n1. Premise 1: If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. (This can be symbolized as: If P, then Q)\n2. Premise 2: It's not the case that the pants must have been denim. (This can be symbolized as: Not Q)\n3. Conclusion: The shirt was not cotton. (This can be symbolized as: Not P)\n\nThe structure of the argument is:\n- If P, then Q\n- Not Q\n- Therefore, Not P\n\nThis is a classic example of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus tollens states that if \"If P, then Q\" is true, and Q is false (Not Q), then P must also be false (Not P). \n\nIn this argument:\n- The first premise establishes a conditional relationship between the shirt being cotton and the pants being denim.\n- The second premise denies the consequent (the pants being denim).\n- The conclusion denies the antecedent (the shirt being cotton).\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens structure, it is logically valid. The truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
