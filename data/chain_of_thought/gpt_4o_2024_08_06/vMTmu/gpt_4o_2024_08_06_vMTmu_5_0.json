            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and its contrapositive. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\" This can be symbolized as: \n   - \\( J \\rightarrow A \\)\n   where \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) represents \"Amy must have played tennis.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\" This is the negation of \\( A \\), symbolized as:\n   - \\( \\neg A \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Jeff did not play basketball.\" This is the negation of \\( J \\), symbolized as:\n   - \\( \\neg J \\)\n\nThe argument can be structured as follows:\n- Premise 1: \\( J \\rightarrow A \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg A \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg J \\)\n\nThis structure is a classic example of modus tollens, a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus tollens states that if you have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and the negation of the consequent \\( \\neg Q \\), you can conclude the negation of the antecedent \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nIn this case:\n- \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis)\n- \\( \\neg A \\) (It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis)\n- Therefore, \\( \\neg J \\) (Jeff did not play basketball)\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens form, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
