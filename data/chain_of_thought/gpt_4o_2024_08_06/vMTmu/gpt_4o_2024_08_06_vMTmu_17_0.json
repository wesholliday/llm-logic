            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in a form that can be evaluated using principles of formal logic, specifically modus tollens.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\" This can be symbolized as: \n   - P \u2192 Q\n   where P is \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q is \"Kate must have eaten salad.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad.\" This is the negation of Q:\n   - \u00acQ\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Ben did not eat pasta.\" This is the negation of P:\n   - \u00acP\n\nThe argument can be structured as follows:\n- Premise 1: P \u2192 Q\n- Premise 2: \u00acQ\n- Conclusion: \u00acP\n\nThis structure is a classic example of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Modus tollens states that if you have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ), you can conclude the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP).\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the modus tollens form:\n- If P \u2192 Q (If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad)\n- \u00acQ (It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad)\n- Therefore, \u00acP (Ben did not eat pasta)\n\nSince the argument follows a valid logical form, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
