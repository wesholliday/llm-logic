            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and its contrapositive.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" This can be symbolized as: \n   - P \u2192 Q\n   where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck must have been metal.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\" This is the negation of Q:\n   - \u00acQ\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The doll was not plastic.\" This is the negation of P:\n   - \u00acP\n\nThe argument can be structured as follows:\n- Premise 1: P \u2192 Q\n- Premise 2: \u00acQ\n- Conclusion: \u00acP\n\nThis structure is a classic example of modus tollens, a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus tollens states that if you have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ), you can conclude the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP).\n\nTherefore, given the premises, the conclusion logically follows. The argument is valid because it correctly applies the modus tollens rule.\n\nAnswer: yes",
