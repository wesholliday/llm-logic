            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in a conditional form, which can be analyzed using propositional logic.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n   - \\( V \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( V \\) represents \"the vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the mummy must have been awake.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\" In logical terms, this is:\n   - \\( \\neg M \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The vampire was not awake.\" In logical terms, this is:\n   - \\( \\neg V \\)\n\nThe argument can be summarized as:\n- Premise 1: \\( V \\rightarrow M \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg M \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg V \\)\n\nThis form of argument is a classic example of Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus Tollens states that if you have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and you know that \\( \\neg Q \\) is true, then you can conclude \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nApplying Modus Tollens to our argument:\n- From \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\), we can conclude \\( \\neg V \\).\n\nSince the conclusion \\( \\neg V \\) logically follows from the premises using Modus Tollens, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
