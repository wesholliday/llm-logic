            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument is structured as follows:\n\n1. Premise 1: If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. (This can be symbolized as: A \u2192 C)\n2. Premise 2: It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race. (This can be symbolized as: \u00acC)\n3. Conclusion: Alex did not finish the race. (This can be symbolized as: \u00acA)\n\nThis argument form is a classic example of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus tollens can be summarized as:\n\n- If P, then Q.\n- Not Q.\n- Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- P is \"Alex finished the race\" (A).\n- Q is \"Chris must have finished the race\" (C).\n\nAccording to modus tollens:\n\n- If A \u2192 C (If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race),\n- and \u00acC (It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race),\n- then \u00acA (Alex did not finish the race).\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises using modus tollens, which confirms that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
