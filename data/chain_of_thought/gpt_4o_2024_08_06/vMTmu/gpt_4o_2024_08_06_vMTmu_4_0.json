            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in a form that resembles a common logical structure known as \"modus tollens.\" Let's break down the premises and conclusion:\n\n1. First premise: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\" This can be symbolized as: \\( A \\rightarrow R \\), where \\( A \\) represents \"the alien visited Mars\" and \\( R \\) represents \"the robot must have visited Jupiter.\"\n\n2. Second premise: \"It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter.\" This can be symbolized as: \\( \\neg R \\).\n\n3. Conclusion: \"The alien did not visit Mars.\" This can be symbolized as: \\( \\neg A \\).\n\nThe structure of the argument is as follows:\n\n- Premise 1: \\( A \\rightarrow R \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg R \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg A \\)\n\nThis structure matches the modus tollens form, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus tollens states that if you have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and you know that \\( \\neg Q \\) is true, then you can conclude \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nIn this case:\n- \\( A \\rightarrow R \\) is the conditional statement.\n- \\( \\neg R \\) is given as true.\n- Therefore, \\( \\neg A \\) logically follows.\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens form, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
