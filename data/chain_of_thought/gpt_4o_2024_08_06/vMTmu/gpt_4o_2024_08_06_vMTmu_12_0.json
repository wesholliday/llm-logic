            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in a form that resembles a common logical structure known as \"modus tollens.\" Let's break down the premises and conclusion:\n\n1. First premise: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This can be symbolized as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n\n2. Second premise: \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This can be symbolized as: \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n3. Conclusion: \"Joe did not go to the park.\" This can be symbolized as: \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nThe structure of the argument is:\n\n- Premise 1: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nThis is a classic example of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus tollens states that if you have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and you know that \\( Q \\) is false (\\( \\neg Q \\)), then you can conclude that \\( P \\) must also be false (\\( \\neg P \\)).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it correctly applies the modus tollens rule.\n\nAnswer: yes",
