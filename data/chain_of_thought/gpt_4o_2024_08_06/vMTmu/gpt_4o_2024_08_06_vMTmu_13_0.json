            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in a form that resembles a common logical structure known as \"modus tollens.\" \n\nLet's break down the premises and conclusion:\n\n1. First premise: \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" This can be symbolized as: \n   - If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck must have been blue.\"\n\n2. Second premise: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\" This can be symbolized as:\n   - Not Q (\u00acQ).\n\n3. Conclusion: \"The car was not red.\" This can be symbolized as:\n   - Not P (\u00acP).\n\nThe structure of the argument is as follows:\n- Premise 1: P \u2192 Q\n- Premise 2: \u00acQ\n- Conclusion: \u00acP\n\nThis is a classic example of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus tollens states that if \"If P, then Q\" is true, and Q is false (\u00acQ), then P must also be false (\u00acP). \n\nTherefore, given the premises, the conclusion logically follows. The argument is valid because it correctly applies the modus tollens rule.\n\nAnswer: yes",
