            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in a form that resembles a logical syllogism. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This can be symbolized as: \\( L \\rightarrow M \\), where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( M \\) represents \"Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This is the negation of \\( M \\), symbolized as \\( \\neg M \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" This is the negation of \\( L \\), symbolized as \\( \\neg L \\).\n\nThe argument can be structured as follows:\n\n- Premise 1: \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg M \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg L \\)\n\nThis structure is a classic example of a valid argument form known as \"Modus Tollens.\" Modus Tollens is a rule of inference that can be summarized as follows: If \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) are both true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\nApplying Modus Tollens to our argument:\n\n- We have \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) (if \\( L \\) then \\( M \\)).\n- We have \\( \\neg M \\) (not \\( M \\)).\n- Therefore, we can conclude \\( \\neg L \\) (not \\( L \\)).\n\nSince the argument follows the Modus Tollens form, it is logically valid. The conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
