            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'Mark bought the blue shirt' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'Lisa bought the red shirt'. This is a straightforward assertion that Lisa indeed purchased the red shirt.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'. In logical terms, this can be represented as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and Q is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' means that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. \n\nNow, let's apply this to our situation:\n\n- We know from the first statement that P ('Lisa bought the red shirt') is true.\n- The conditional statement tells us that if P is true, then Q ('Mark bought the blue shirt') must also be true.\n\nSince P is true, the condition for the implication is satisfied, and therefore, Q must also be true.\n\nThus, based on the given statements, we can logically infer that 'Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
