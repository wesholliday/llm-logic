            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The banana was yellow' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'The apple was red'. This is a straightforward declarative statement that asserts the color of the apple.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'. In logical terms, this can be represented as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'The apple was red' and Q is 'The banana was yellow'.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' means that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. It does not provide any information about what happens if P is false.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given statements:\n\n- We have 'The apple was red' (P is true).\n- We also have the conditional 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' (If P, then Q).\n\nSince P is true ('The apple was red'), and we have the conditional statement 'If P, then Q', we can conclude that Q must also be true. Therefore, 'The banana was yellow' follows logically from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
