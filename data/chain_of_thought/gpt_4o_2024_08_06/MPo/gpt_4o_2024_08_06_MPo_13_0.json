            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The truck was blue' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'The car was red'. This is a straightforward assertion about the color of the car.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'. In logical terms, this can be represented as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'The car was red' and Q is 'The truck was blue'.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' means that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. \n\nNow, let's apply this to the given statements:\n\n- We have 'The car was red' (P is true).\n- We also have the conditional 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' (If P, then Q).\n\nSince P is true ('The car was red'), and we have the conditional statement 'If P, then Q', we can conclude that Q must also be true. Therefore, 'The truck was blue' is a valid inference based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
