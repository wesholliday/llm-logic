            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The pants were denim' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'The shirt was cotton'. This is a straightforward assertion about the material of the shirt.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'. In logical terms, this can be represented as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'The shirt was cotton' and Q is 'The pants were denim'.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' means that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. This is known as modus ponens, a valid form of argument. \n\nGiven:\n- P: The shirt was cotton (which is true according to the first statement).\n- 'If P, then Q': If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n\nSince P is true ('The shirt was cotton'), and we have the conditional 'If P, then Q', we can apply modus ponens to conclude that Q must also be true. Therefore, 'The pants were denim' is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
