            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The mummy was awake' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'The vampire was awake'. This is a straightforward assertion that the vampire is indeed awake.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake'. In logical terms, this can be represented as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'The vampire was awake' and Q is 'The mummy was awake'.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' means that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. It does not provide any information about what happens when P is false, but in this case, we know P is true because the first statement asserts 'The vampire was awake'.\n\nSince the first statement confirms that the vampire was indeed awake (P is true), and the second statement tells us that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy is also awake (P implies Q), we can logically conclude that the mummy must be awake (Q is true).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'The mummy was awake'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
