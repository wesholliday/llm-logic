            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'Sue was at the wedding' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'Mary was at the wedding'. This is a straightforward assertion that Mary attended the wedding.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'. In logical terms, this can be represented as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'Mary was at the wedding' and Q is 'Sue was at the wedding'.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' means that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. \n\nNow, let's apply this to our situation:\n\n- We know from the first statement that 'Mary was at the wedding' is true. This means P is true.\n- According to the conditional statement, if P is true, then Q must also be true. Therefore, 'Sue was at the wedding' must be true.\n\nSince both the premise (Mary was at the wedding) and the conditional statement (If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding) are true, we can logically infer that 'Sue was at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
