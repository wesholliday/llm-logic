            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The book is a mystery novel' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'The book was written by James.' This is a straightforward assertion about the authorship of the book.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.' In logical terms, this can be represented as 'If P, then Q,' where P is 'The book was written by James' and Q is 'The book is a mystery novel.'\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' means that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. \n\nNow, let's apply this to the given statements:\n\n- We have 'The book was written by James' (P is true).\n- We also have the conditional 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' (If P, then Q).\n\nSince P is true ('The book was written by James'), and we have the conditional statement 'If P, then Q,' we can conclude that Q must also be true. Therefore, 'The book is a mystery novel' follows logically from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
