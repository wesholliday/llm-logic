            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether 'Mary was at the wedding' is true, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements provided.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"M \u2192 S,\" where M stands for \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S stands for \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that if M is true, then S must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Sue was at the wedding,\" which means S is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if M (Mary was at the wedding) is necessarily true given these statements.\n\nThe conditional statement \"M \u2192 S\" does not provide any information about what happens if S is true. It only tells us that if M is true, then S must be true. However, S being true does not imply that M must be true. There could be other reasons or conditions under which S is true without M being true.\n\nFor example, Sue could have been at the wedding for reasons unrelated to Mary's presence. The truth of S does not force M to be true; it only confirms that if M were true, S would also be true, which is consistent with the given information.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot conclude that Mary was at the wedding just because Sue was there.\n\nAnswer: no",
