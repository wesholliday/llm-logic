            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'Sue might not have chosen pizza' from 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement, 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza', is a negation of a necessity. In modal logic, 'must' indicates necessity, meaning that in all possible scenarios, Sue has chosen pizza. The negation of this statement, 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza', implies that it is not necessary for Sue to have chosen pizza in all scenarios. This means there is at least one possible scenario where Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nThe statement 'Sue might not have chosen pizza' is an expression of possibility. It suggests that there is at least one scenario where Sue did not choose pizza. This aligns with the implication of the original statement, which indicates that it is not necessary for Sue to have chosen pizza in every scenario, thus allowing for the possibility that she did not choose pizza in some scenarios.\n\nTherefore, the inference from 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza' to 'Sue might not have chosen pizza' is valid because the negation of necessity ('not must') implies the possibility of the opposite ('might not').\n\nAnswer: yes",
