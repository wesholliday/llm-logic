            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt' from 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement, 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt', is a negation of a necessity. In modal logic, 'must' indicates necessity, meaning that in all possible scenarios, Lisa bought the red shirt. The negation of this statement, 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt', implies that it is not necessary for Lisa to have bought the red shirt. This means there is at least one possible scenario where Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nThe statement 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt' suggests that there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. In modal logic, 'might' indicates possibility, meaning that there is at least one scenario where the statement is true.\n\nSince 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt' implies that there is at least one scenario where Lisa did not buy the red shirt, it aligns with the idea that 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt'. Therefore, the original statement does indeed allow for the possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
