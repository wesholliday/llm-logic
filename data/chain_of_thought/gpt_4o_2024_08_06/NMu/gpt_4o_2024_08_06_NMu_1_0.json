            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'Mary might not have been at the wedding' from 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement, 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding', is a negation of a necessity. In modal logic, 'must' indicates necessity, so 'Mary must have been at the wedding' means that it is necessarily true that Mary was at the wedding. The negation of this statement, 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding', implies that it is not necessarily true that Mary was at the wedding. This means that there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nThe statement 'Mary might not have been at the wedding' is a possibility statement. In modal logic, 'might' indicates possibility. If it is not necessarily true that Mary was at the wedding, then it is possible that she was not at the wedding. Therefore, the negation of the necessity ('It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding') allows for the possibility that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nThus, from the statement 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding', we can indeed infer 'Mary might not have been at the wedding', because the negation of a necessity implies the possibility of the opposite.\n\nAnswer: yes",
