            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a negation, followed by a conclusion. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be symbolized as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Tom watched football\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n2. The second premise is \"Tom did not watch football,\" which can be symbolized as \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is \"Jen did not watch basketball,\" which can be symbolized as \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nThe argument can be summarized as follows:\n- Premise 1: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg P \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"denying the antecedent.\" In classical logic, denying the antecedent is not a valid form of argument. The validity of a conditional statement does not allow us to infer the negation of the consequent from the negation of the antecedent. In other words, just because Tom did not watch football (\\( \\neg P \\)), it does not logically follow that Jen did not watch basketball (\\( \\neg Q \\)). Jen could have watched basketball for reasons unrelated to whether Tom watched football.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because it relies on an invalid form of reasoning.\n\nAnswer: no",
