            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a negation, leading to a conclusion. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be symbolized as \\( V \\rightarrow M \\), where \\( V \\) represents \"the vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The vampire was not awake.\" This can be symbolized as \\( \\neg V \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The mummy was not awake.\" This can be symbolized as \\( \\neg M \\).\n\nThe argument can be structured as follows:\n- Premise 1: \\( V \\rightarrow M \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg V \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg M \\)\n\nTo determine if this argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The form of this argument is known as \"denying the antecedent,\" which is a common logical fallacy. In formal logic, denying the antecedent is not a valid form of argument. The validity of an argument depends on whether the conclusion must be true if the premises are true.\n\nIn this case, the premises do not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. The conditional statement \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) only tells us that if \\( V \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must be true. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if \\( V \\) is false. The truth of \\( M \\) is not determined by the falsity of \\( V \\) alone. Therefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg M \\) does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
