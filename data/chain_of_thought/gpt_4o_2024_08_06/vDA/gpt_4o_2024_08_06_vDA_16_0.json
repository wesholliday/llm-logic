            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a negation, leading to a conclusion. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This can be symbolized as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\n2. The second premise is \"The shirt was not cotton,\" which is the negation of P, symbolized as \u00acP.\n\n3. The conclusion is \"The pants were not denim,\" which is the negation of Q, symbolized as \u00acQ.\n\nThe argument can be summarized as:\n- Premise 1: P \u2192 Q\n- Premise 2: \u00acP\n- Conclusion: \u00acQ\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"denying the antecedent.\" In classical logic, denying the antecedent is not a valid form of argument. The validity of a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) does not allow us to infer \u00acQ from \u00acP. The truth of Q is not dependent solely on P being true; Q could still be true even if P is false.\n\nFor example, consider:\n- If it rains, then the ground will be wet (P \u2192 Q).\n- It did not rain (\u00acP).\n- We cannot conclude that the ground is not wet (\u00acQ) because there could be other reasons for the ground to be wet, such as someone watering it.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
