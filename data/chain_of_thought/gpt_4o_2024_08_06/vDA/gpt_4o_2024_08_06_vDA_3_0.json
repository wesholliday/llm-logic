            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a negation, followed by a conclusion. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be symbolized as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. The second premise is a negation of the antecedent: \"The book was not written by James.\" This can be symbolized as \"not P\" (\u00acP).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The book is not a mystery novel.\" This can be symbolized as \"not Q\" (\u00acQ).\n\nThe argument can be summarized as:\n- Premise 1: P \u2192 Q\n- Premise 2: \u00acP\n- Conclusion: \u00acQ\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"denying the antecedent.\" In formal logic, denying the antecedent is a logical fallacy. The validity of a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) does not allow us to conclude \u00acQ from \u00acP. The truth of Q is not dependent solely on P being true; Q could still be true for other reasons not related to P.\n\nFor example, even if the book was not written by James, it could still be a mystery novel written by someone else. Therefore, the conclusion \"The book is not a mystery novel\" does not logically follow from the premises given.\n\nAnswer: no",
