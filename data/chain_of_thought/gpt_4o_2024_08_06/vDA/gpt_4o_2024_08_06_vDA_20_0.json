            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a negation, which is a common logical form. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. The second premise is \"The apple was not red,\" which is the negation of P, represented as \u00acP.\n\n3. The conclusion is \"The banana was not yellow,\" which is the negation of Q, represented as \u00acQ.\n\nThe argument can be summarized as:\n- Premise 1: P \u2192 Q\n- Premise 2: \u00acP\n- Conclusion: \u00acQ\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"denying the antecedent.\" In classical logic, denying the antecedent is not a valid form of argument. The reason is that the truth of the conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) does not provide any information about the truth of Q when P is false. In other words, just because the apple was not red (\u00acP), it does not logically follow that the banana was not yellow (\u00acQ). The banana could still be yellow for reasons unrelated to the color of the apple.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
