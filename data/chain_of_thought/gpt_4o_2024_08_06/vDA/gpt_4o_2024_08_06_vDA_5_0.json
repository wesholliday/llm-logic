            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a negation, leading to a conclusion. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\n2. The second premise is \"Jeff did not play basketball,\" which is the negation of P, represented as \u00acP.\n\n3. The conclusion is \"Amy did not play tennis,\" which is the negation of Q, represented as \u00acQ.\n\nThe argument can be summarized as:\n- Premise 1: P \u2192 Q\n- Premise 2: \u00acP\n- Conclusion: \u00acQ\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"denying the antecedent.\" In classical logic, denying the antecedent is not a valid form of argument. The reason is that the truth of the conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) does not provide any information about the truth of Q if P is false. The conditional statement only asserts that if P is true, then Q must be true. However, if P is false, Q could be either true or false, and the conditional statement does not specify which.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \u00acQ (\"Amy did not play tennis\") does not logically follow from the premises. The argument is not valid because the premises do not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
