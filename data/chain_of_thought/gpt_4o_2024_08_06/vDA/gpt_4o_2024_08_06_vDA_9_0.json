            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a negation, leading to a conclusion. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be symbolized as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The second premise is \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt,\" which can be symbolized as \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt,\" which can be symbolized as \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nThe argument can be summarized as:\n- Premise 1: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg P \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"denying the antecedent.\" In classical logic, denying the antecedent is not a valid form of argument. The validity of a conditional statement does not depend on the truth of the antecedent. Just because the antecedent \\( P \\) is false (Lisa did not buy the red shirt), it does not necessarily follow that the consequent \\( Q \\) is false (Mark did not buy the blue shirt). The truth of \\( Q \\) is independent of the truth of \\( P \\) when \\( P \\) is false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion \\( \\neg Q \\) does not logically follow from the premises \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
