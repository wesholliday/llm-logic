            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a negation, leading to a conclusion. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This can be symbolized as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the car was red\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\n2. The second premise is \"The car was not red,\" which is the negation of \\( P \\), symbolized as \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is \"The truck was not blue,\" which is the negation of \\( Q \\), symbolized as \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nThe argument can be summarized as:\n- Premise 1: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg P \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"denying the antecedent.\" In classical logic, denying the antecedent is not a valid form of argument. The validity of a conditional statement does not allow us to infer the negation of the consequent from the negation of the antecedent. In other words, just because the car was not red (\\( \\neg P \\)), it does not logically follow that the truck was not blue (\\( \\neg Q \\)). The truck could still be blue for reasons unrelated to the color of the car.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
