            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a negation, followed by a conclusion. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This can be symbolized as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q is \"Kate ate salad.\"\n\n2. The second premise is \"Ben did not eat pasta,\" which is the negation of P, symbolized as \"\u00acP.\"\n\n3. The conclusion is \"Kate did not eat salad,\" which is the negation of Q, symbolized as \"\u00acQ.\"\n\nThe argument can be summarized as:\n- Premise 1: P \u2192 Q\n- Premise 2: \u00acP\n- Conclusion: \u00acQ\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"denying the antecedent.\" In classical logic, denying the antecedent is not a valid form of argument. The validity of a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) does not allow us to infer \u00acQ from \u00acP. The truth of Q is not dependent solely on P being true; Q could still be true even if P is false.\n\nFor example, consider:\n- If it is raining, then the ground is wet. (P \u2192 Q)\n- It is not raining. (\u00acP)\n- Therefore, the ground is not wet. (\u00acQ)\n\nThis conclusion is not necessarily valid because the ground could be wet for other reasons, such as someone watering the garden.\n\nTherefore, the argument \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad; Ben did not eat pasta; therefore, Kate did not eat salad\" is not logically valid because it relies on the fallacy of denying the antecedent.\n\nAnswer: no",
