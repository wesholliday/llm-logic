            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a negation, leading to a conclusion. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be symbolized as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The second premise is \"Joe did not go to the park,\" which can be symbolized as \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is \"Lucy did not go to the zoo,\" which can be symbolized as \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nThe argument can be summarized as follows:\n- Premise 1: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg P \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"denying the antecedent.\" In classical logic, denying the antecedent is not a valid form of argument. The reason is that the truth of the conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not provide any information about the truth of \\( Q \\) if \\( P \\) is false. The conditional statement only tells us that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true. However, if \\( P \\) is false, \\( Q \\) could be either true or false, and we cannot conclude \\( \\neg Q \\) based solely on \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion \\( \\neg Q \\) does not necessarily follow from the premises \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
